[Second Life](http://secondlife.com) has gone offline. I just read about it [on Blog Age](http://www.blogh.de/643) and it sure sounds interesting and shows how interesting virtual worlds can be. To put the problem back in our world, somebody found a bug that allows other people to steal (or rather get control over other persons items) and they are now working on fixing that. :)

The official Second Life Blog has [some more infos](http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/10/14/grid-closed-while-exploit-is-addressed/) for those wanting to see the story develop from inside. There are already well over 1000 comments from the close to 1 million players. I hope they have a good backend when 1 million people start downloading the new client. :)
