Checking out the GOOG insider transactions list gives you an interesting list of who is selling how much. Over 8% of the insider holding were sold in the last 6 months. Congratulations to all those selling. But look at who is selling (next to all the big guys who are selling in the millions.)

Building up trust funds seems to be the rave at Google at the moment. :)

Check this out:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;[The Reyes, Nichole Elaine IRREV TR 9/03 G.P. TTEE](http://biz.yahoo.com/t/81/5491.html), with a planned sales of over $3 million in shares.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;[The Shiriram, K. Ram 10B5-1 Sales Plan](http://biz.yahoo.com/t/56/5336.html) seems to ongoingly planning to sell 300k shares. I actually even presume they were sold and just not listed on that page? It's too regular. Congratulations for over $250 million then :)&lt;/li&gt;
