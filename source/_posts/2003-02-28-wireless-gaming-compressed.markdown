&lt;a title=&quot;I, Cringely | The Pulpit&quot; href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20030227.html&quot;&gt;Cringely talks&lt;/a&gt; about ProGATE in his latest article. It's a technology to compress 3D scenes by as much as 50-to-1. In general, it's right that this is wonderful for networked gaming, but more specifically, it might enable downloadable 3D Games to mobile phones, provided the engine does not need too much CPU power, which does not seem to be the case.
