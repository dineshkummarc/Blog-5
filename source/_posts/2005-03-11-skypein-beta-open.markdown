&lt;p&gt;Now go to [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) and log in to your account. For 30 EURs a year you can now get a number in the US, Hong-Kong/China, France or UK and you can get 3 numbers all in all. Kick ass! &lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; You need the new Skype Beta Version 2.0 for it to work, or so it seems. I couldn't call my San Francisco Number without the new app ;)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
