There we go. It [seems](http://www.abakus-internet-marketing.de/en/forum/viewtopic/t-563.html) that Microsoft have opened a [beta of their search engine](http://beta.search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=Oliver+Thylmann&amp;FORM=SMCRT) to the public. It's not sure on which kind of code this is based and if it uses data collected via the MSNBot to give the results. It will be interesting to see when they get this one done.
