You can really do some interesting stuff on the web, one of which is creating pages/images that look like error messages and pop up in your browser. Like so:

[&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/error.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Error&quot; /&gt;](http://owt.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/error.jpg)

Thankfully there was the url at the top, not that I would have believed it otherwise, but like this it was sure. Not bad if it weren't so mean, then again, they were nice enough to add &quot;advertisement&quot; on the bottom right ... that seems to make this kind of stuff all right ;)
