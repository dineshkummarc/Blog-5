John reports about [Tivo Bringing Search to Ads](http://battellemedia.com/archives/002064.php) and I think this is something that will grow a lot in the next few years. All we need is a little back channel from the TV and things are starting to be put together to enable us to do just that. [Visible World](http://www.visibleworld.com/) is a good example on how to have variable ads shown on TV based on different inputs, and one of that might really be performance of the ads in a relatively timely manner. If you take something like [T-Online Vision](http://vision.t-online.de/), which allows you to get Films over your broadband connection, then you are starting to have a system where people can click links for follow ups or even give their personal data to get more information via a form. This could even be done automatically if their contact data is available in the system.

How could this look like? I am a big advertiser that want to give people a chance to experience my product first hand, with a nice prospectus going out before the product hits the stores and the option to buy right from my online store before public availability. The advertising backend will show me what kind of tags users use to save their shows, what they save and what they see on their TV. I might even know what they search for in general or what they have booked for their next viewing pleasure. Through this I can find my most fitting customers. A targeted ad to those people, with an easy way to give their contact data to be called and sent further information, will likely work very well. I could even adapt the ad over time to only have those ads running that perform really well based on Taguchi and other analysis. This is how all this will evolve and I am looking forward to it indeed. Now we analyse click streams, in the future also view streams.
