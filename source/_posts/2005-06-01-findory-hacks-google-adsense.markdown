InsideGoogle [Findory kind of hacking Google AdSense](http://google.blognewschannel.com/index.php/archives/2005/05/31/findory-adds-ads-personalizing-google-adsense/). I posted [about Findory some time ago](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/04/my_findory_neig.html) and now they seem to have done a little deal with Google. What they seem to be doing is to pass some extra keywords to the AdSense system to allow for Google to target AdWords ads to a page that are unrelated to the content of the page. Where does the targeting then come from you might ask. From the keywords Findory passes over which again are based on user information they have. 

This is actually  a wonderful idea and might be very powerful in the future. The only problem is that Google can't really make everyone use it unless they have a lot more conversion tracking going on, as people can put just about any keyword into the system (which is not available yet anyway, so relax ;)). If they do a special deal with a specific site they might really be able to increase their and the sites revenue especially if that site has some information that is relevant to the user.

It will likely make people think about contextual advertising again though because in some cases it is just wrong. If the site has some info about the things I read previously, they might still  be  relevant. If a site has my  stock portfolio, it might be able to deduce some things from that. Lots of potential to think about.
