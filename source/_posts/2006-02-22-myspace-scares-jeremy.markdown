Jeremy wrote a great post entitled [MySpace is the New Blogosphere](http://www.ensight.org/archives/2006/02/21/myspace-is-the-new-blogosphere/) and in summary, [MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/) scares him! When fully thinking about it, I can do nothing but agree. The easiest point to understand is this bit:

*Letâ€™s be fair. In April, MySpace will become the most trafficked site on the planet. By the end of the year, MySpace will account for roughly 10% of all web traffic and, by the end of 2006 (if growth and acceleration curves maintain), it will account for about 40% (accounting for a plateau, because realistically we canâ€™t have more people on MySpace than are on the entire web).*

That should be enough to scary many people out there and his point that it is growing almost three times as fast as the blogosphere and already has one third of the users should scare a few people too. This is already and will be a force to be dealt with. And hey, their &quot;problems&quot; with child molesters and the like... any single country with 30 million people has that problem too. It was to be expected and needs to be dealt with but it is nothing that surprises me the least bit.
