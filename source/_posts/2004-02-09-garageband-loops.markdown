Garageband Loops are starting to float arround the net in numerous locations, based on [this article](http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,62204,00.html) in Wired. Look at [GarangeBand](http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/) actually makes me wonder if buying iLife wouldn't be nice. I mean $49 for the entire package is really not a lot and making a bit of music, no matter how bad it turns out, could be lots of fun. I just wonder how easy it really is.
