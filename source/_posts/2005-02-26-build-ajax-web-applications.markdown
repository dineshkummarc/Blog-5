Jesse James Garret, founder of Adaptive Path, wrote a great piece entitled [ajax: a new approach to web applications](http://adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php). A lot of great apps on the web are based on the methodology, which includes XmlHttpRequest, JavaScript, standard complient design and potentially the use of XML/XSLT. I have been pushing xhtml/css for some time and Ajax seems to be the next step. As Jesse says, what it really requires is a new kind of thinking and it brings more power to user interaction design to the web. Great stuff, and some very good links in the article that go deeper.
