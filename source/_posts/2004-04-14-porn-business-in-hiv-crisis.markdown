[Fleshbot](http://www.fleshbot.com/) has a good summary of the currently ongoing [HIV Crisis in the Porn world](http://www.fleshbot.com/archives/porns_new_hiv_crisis_015044.php). It seems that one male veteran porn star has been diagnosed with HIV and it is believed that the resulting fall out could be huge especially when including second or even third generation. It will be interesting to see how the industry handles this. Based on [this article](http://www.avn.com/index.php?Primary_Navigation=Articles&amp;Action=View_Article&amp;Content_ID=80503) on AVN there will be a quarantine on second and first generation (12 women seem to be in the first generation bit) of 60 days, meaning that business as usual could resume by June 8th.
