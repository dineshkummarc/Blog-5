I needed to drill a few holes and the standard drill just didn't cut it in the ceiling. It would just stop. As of today, I am the proud owner of a [Bosch-Bohrhammer PBH 2000 RE](http://www.bosch-pt.de/boptocs-de/Product.jsp;jsessionid=B5A1E16F97F4A1C67C2AEDFE0310E3EC?division=hw&amp;ccat_id=9625&amp;prod_id=9596), the cheap version of a power drill or whatever you call it in english. It has a pneumatic drill and goes through the ceiling like butter. While having your first dish washer was already a sign of getting old, I think I am there now with this tool and actually ... enjoying going to Bauhaus or some other market where you can buy drills and the like is a clear enough sign :)
