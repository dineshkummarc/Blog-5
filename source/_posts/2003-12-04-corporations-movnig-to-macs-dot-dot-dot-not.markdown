Jeremy seems to have looked into &lt;a title=&quot;Ensight - Jeremy C. Wright&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ensight.org/archives/2003/12/03/dont_move_to_mac.html&quot;&gt;getting the company he works for to move to Macs&lt;/a&gt;. His approach was very good I have to say and this makes the result even more important. It's a nogo. He also has a list why, including HR and CRM Software and most importantly environmental emulation. What he means there is that people know the buttons in windows and if you don't want to train them, then you will need to make the Apple behave exactly like Windows. 

This comes from the way people work with computers. I once saw a three stage model about it. Stage one would be ... barely. :) Stage two, you know how to do what you need to do. You don't really know what you do but it kind of works. Stage three is when you start to understand how applications on computers work and behave and you just kind of know your way arround. For stage 3 people, moving to Macs is easy. But most people are on stage 1 or 2 (and rightfully so) and it would be a huge cost to retrain them.

The only thing I wonder is whether you could not give a choice to a few people to get a Mac if they want to. Problem here would be that you need two support people dependant on who gets the Macs ;)
