Another nice to read ChangeThis Manifesto. This time it's Mark Cuban's [Success &amp; Motivation: from Joe Schmo to The Benefactor](http://www.changethis.com/5.SuccessMotivation). It doesn't really go all the way but gives a nice account on what Mark did in his life and how he got where he is at now. Great read if you like stuff like that. A very nice part is where he talks about his introduction to PC Limited...

&lt;I&gt;&quot;The PC Limited ads because the market price for peripherals. I looked for the ad every week. In fact, I became a customer. I was in Dallas. They were in Austin. I remember driving down to pick up some hard drives that I was going to put into my customers' PCs. I had no idea, until that point, that they had just moved from the owner's dorm room into a little office/warehouse space. I was so impressed by this young kid (I was a wise, old twenty-five at the time), that I actually wrote a letter thanking him for the great job he was doing, and, I'm embarrassed to say now, I told him that if he kept up what he was doing, he was destined for far bigger and better things.

I kept on doing business with PCs Limited, and Michael Dell kept on doing what he was doing. I don't think he needed my encouragement, ...&quot;&lt;/I&gt;
