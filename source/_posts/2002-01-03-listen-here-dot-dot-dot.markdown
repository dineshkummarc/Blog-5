I wanted to possibly buy the new No Doubt CD yesterday so I went into one of the big chains called Saturn, which is about the same size as Media Markt and both of these belong to the same company, but that is another story.

I kind of wanted to listen to the CD before buying it though so I asked somebody running around there where I could listen to the CD. He said, at any of these stations with headphones on the CD racks. Yeah right, I'll run around the entire shop looking for the place where the No Doubt CD is on. That's when I stopped to read.

&quot;Take your CD and hold the bar code at the bottom of the CD under the red light.&quot;

I wondered, could it be? Could somebody have really put something like this up? How long would it take?

I put on the headphones. Put the CD under the scanner. Instantly, and I mean instantly, it took nothing more than 1 second tops, the first song from the CD started playing. It's not the entire song, it's just something like 30 seconds. Then a voice says &quot;2&quot; and you have the next song, I would presume from second 30 to 60 or something.

I have to say that I was positively surprised at a good way of using technology and I put another 10 CDs under this thing which I would have never thought about buying. I could resist buying them but it was close. It will be getting closer.
