Thanks to [Sixtus](http://www.sixtus.net/index/P216/) I just found out that [20six just bought/merged (with) myblog.de](http://www.20six.de/news). I started noticing myblog.de some time ago, especially as it largely seems to be one guy doing his thing. Together, both of them seem to be the biggest blog host in Germany now. [Loic](http://www.loiclemeur.com/) told me about 20six at our blogger meeting in DÃ¼sseldorf. I had never heard of them before, at least not so much that they were in my head, and now, they grab myblog.de. Weird. I somehow still don't believe that they stand a chance against [Blogg.de](http://www.blogg.de/) and/or [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com/), at least not in the long run and as a viable business. But that's maybe just because I have a bit more of a personal connection to both of them.
