You might wonder what I mean with that headline but this is just what I found on Frank Boosman's blog: &lt;a title=&quot;When Does $350 Million Equal 42 Hours?&quot; href=&quot;http://www.boosman.com/blog/archives/2005/01/when_does_350_m.html&quot;&gt;pseudorandom: When Does $350 Million Equal 42 Hours?.

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.boosman.com/blog/archives/2005/01/when_does_350_m.html&quot;&gt;[...] the war in Iraq has cost $130 billion to date (per the Office of Management and Budget). [...], which in turn equals $198,730,732 per day.

In other words, the total amount committed by the US government to date for tsunami relief -- $350,000,000 -- equals 42.27 hours of the cost of the war in Iraq. [...]

Oh boy, does put things in perspective doesn't it? Thanks for that one Frank.
