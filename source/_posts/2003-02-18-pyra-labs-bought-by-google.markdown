Well if that is not interesting: &lt;a title=&quot;Google buys blog tool developer | CNET News.com&quot; href=&quot;http://news.com.com/2100-1023-984809.html?tag=fd_top&quot;&gt;Google buys blog tool developer | CNET News.com&lt;/a&gt;. They are talking about Pyra Labs, the makers of [Blogger.com](http://www.blogger.com/), one of the biggest hosted Weblog solutions out there. With [news.google.com](http://news.google.com/) and their newsgroup archives and posting, the are moving more and more into non-search fields. Give it a bit more and they have a very powerful portal, with all the news thats fit to print, powerful search, an amazing site list, discussions and personal Weblogs of about one million users. And all that with now content production of their own!!!
