There we go. The development kit for the XBox has shipped and it seems to be running on a modified Windows NT Kernel on the Mac ([more](http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=14407))! This seems to put a lot more weight on the fact that the XBox 2 will use IBM Chipsets. Having just come back from a big meeting with friends in the netherlands, I can say that IBM was a subjects, because if you think about it, they are really getting huge. They always have been. But who do you really have in chip manufacturing for example? Intel, AMD, two Asian company that are doing the lower power stuff it seems, and then there is IBM. XBox, PS2, ... that's IBM. Their search engine [WebFountain employs some 300 researchers](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2003/10/webfoundtain.html). IBM Services is huge... worth thinking about.
