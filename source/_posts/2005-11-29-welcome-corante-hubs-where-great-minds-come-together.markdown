Today [Corante](http://www.corante.com/) launched their Hubs concept. The idea is to build hubs around certain subjects like media, law, technology, and the like, and then assemble some &quot;top-notch&quot; (their words :)) bloggers to become the basis of the site through aggregation of their posts. These people do not become writers that write on another blog than their own, but simply deliver more or less focussed content in one subject through the aggregation of their feeds. Add to this an editor that cherry picks the posts from these contributors and you have a large resource that is very focussed on that specific subject, linking some very good people together. As Corante says: Where Great Minds Come Together.

Some time ago I received a message from [Francois Gossieaux](http://www.emergencemarketing.com/about.php), who is partner, investor and head of sales and marketing at Corante. He introduced me to the general concept and the longer term idea of the Hubs concept and I really liked it. The nice thing was that his next question was whether I would want to join their Technology/Web Hub. Nice of him to ask, not that there was a great chance of me saying no, especially as I wouldn't be posting on another blog but rather just have my content syndicated to a bigger audience and be part of a kick ass group. I would be a &quot;top-notch&quot; and &quot;Great Minds&quot; person. :)

So as of today, you will also see stuff from me on the [Corante Web Hub](http://web.corante.com/). For the launch there is also a [Corante Media Hub](http://media.corante.com/) and a [Corante Marketing Hub](http://marketing.corante.com/).

You can check out who is part of the Web Hub (Comment: I wrote Web Hug before :)) right [here at the Bio Page](http://web.corante.com/bios.php). Some very interesting people and I am happy to be part of the crowd. Looking forward to building up what network will be about.
