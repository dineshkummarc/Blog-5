If you don't know yet what [Seesmic](http://seesmic.com) from [Loic](http://loiclemeur.com) is about, check out his presentation at VON. (I am actually mentioned twice as oliver from germany and the greetings from germany at the end :))

&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;366&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/W1tFCQQrIh8&amp;rel=1&amp;border=0&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/W1tFCQQrIh8&amp;rel=1&amp;border=0&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; wmode=&quot;transparent&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;366&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;

In short, Loic is trying to build a quasi Twitter for Video, but kind of making it into a real new age TV Platform. Next to letting everyone post a video, see those by their friends, there will be shows automatically generated by videos through voting mechanisms in channels. These might be edited summaries but I am still not shure how these will work in an automated manner. Next he is trying to build small Seesmic Cafes all over the world in major cities where people can come, hang out, and have some chats in front of the camera.

I've been playing with the platform for a bit at the moment and I really do like it. The biggest problem is that I need more filters to get the content from my friends only, because otherwise videos become too much. But the fun thing is that this is a wonderful move on the mobile side. Just imagine getting the videos via the podcast client on your Nokia N95, and allowing you to easily answer from the N95. Now imagine something big happens somewhere. As I said ages ago, [press is not longer going to be the first on the scene](http://blog.thylmann.net/2006/01/12/press-no-longer-first-on-the-scene/), and with something like Seesmic, with a good Atom interface to post video, and something that pulls together channels based on user feedback, I can see the videos run on CNN now in my head.
