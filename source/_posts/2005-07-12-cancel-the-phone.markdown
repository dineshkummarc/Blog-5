Ok, I don't really need a phone anymore, fixed line that is. I have been using [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) a lot in the last few days and it has really grown in terms of SkypeOut. It's at least on par with mobile phones. Sometimes a real fixed line phone is still better, but that might really be multiple reasons, including some that are not really objective. I really have to take a deeper look at their API, as there must be some nice things that can be done with it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
