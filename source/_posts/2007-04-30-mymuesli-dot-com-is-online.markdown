There we go. I met the founders at this years DLD and was at once thrilled by the idea. I somehow think it will work, without even fully knowing their business model. Firt business model will be getting loads of traffic via blogs like mine.

What is [mymuesli](http://mymuesli.com)? It's a site where you can mix your own cereal. That's it. Go with corn only, add a bit of banana and apple or something more exotic, your choice. And if you order now, every sixth package is free! So go and order and tell me what you did :)

Rock on guys! Great startup and a nice site!

&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: First order is out. You can find my mix right [here](http://www.mymuesli.com/muesli-mix.php?mix=34665).
