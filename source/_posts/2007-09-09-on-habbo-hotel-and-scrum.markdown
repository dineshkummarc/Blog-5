The two topics do not really relate but they come up in one [article](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=15397) that Valerie from [alarm:clock euro linked to](http://www.thealarmclock.com/euro/archives/2007/09/how_to_be_habbo_hote.html). GigaOm also has [a few comments](http://gigaom.com/2007/09/08/howhabbo-hotel-got-this-big/) on the article, also stating that the  Sulake Labs, the finish start-up behind Habbo Hotel, is making something like $77 million a year at the moment. Not bad for a 2.5d virtual world. The article is a good read though on learning more how they stumbled upon their success.

&lt;em&gt;Our company has, indeed, stumbled onto some of its new products. But never forget that you can only stumble if you're moving. - Richard P. Carlton, Former CEO, 3M Corporation &lt;/em&gt;

It's a really interesting model their playing with, and fun to hear a bit about what &quot;games&quot; people play within the game. I also found it interesting that the founder talks about having moved all development to an agile/scrum methodology and now releasing every 30 days. They seem to be very happy with it and the switch must have been very hard, especially if you pull it through 100%. The uncertainty that comes into the system is sometimes challenging. The speed, happiness and creativity is the reward.
