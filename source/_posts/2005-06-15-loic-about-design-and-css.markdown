Loic has a short report from reboot about a presentation from [Doug Bowman](http://www.stopdesign.com/about/personnel/?long=true) who did redesigns like Blogger, Wired News and Cap Gemeni. The first name might be signs of some techy connections but Cap Gemeni is not something you redesign just because of connections (ok, the others aren't either, but still :)). In the post Loic links to some fine CSS resources and all who know me know how much I stand behind CSS, having forces several people into using it ... who are now all happier for it ;) See here: &lt;a title=&quot;Design teach-in at Reboot by Doug Bowman&quot; href=&quot;http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2005/06/design_teachin_.html&quot;&gt;Loic Le Meur Blog: Design teach-in at Reboot by Doug Bowman.
