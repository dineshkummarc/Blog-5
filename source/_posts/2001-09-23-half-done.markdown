Well, the first half of the move is done and happened yesterday with the move of my gf's stuff. It went very well with a lot of people helping and therefor it was finished a lot faster than we thought.

We have to say though that the new place is just one floor too high. You know, you carry something heavy up there and just when you have one floor to go you feel like this would be the good place to stop and have the appartment. But no, it's another one floor which really goes on the arms and legs. 

Thankfully we had good weather which was good for loading and unloading and I hope it will stop raining now as I now have to move my things from aachen to cologne. Grrr... Actually I think I have less stuff but I will have ot see if I can take my biggest things appart somehow and I just don'T think it will be possible with my &quot;Schrank&quot; (the place where the clothes are :)). Well, I will see how it goes.

It's actually fun moving and the new place rocks so much it isn't funny. Everybody was getting jealous ;)

More later. I don't have a phone line yet in the new place so updates will be a bit slow.
