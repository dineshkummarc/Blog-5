Finally, another phone is coming and a nice one at that. The [Samsung SGH-T100](http://www.samsungelectronics.com/mobile_phone/wireless_terminals/gsm/sgh_t100_features.html).

Key Features: TFT Color LCD (128x160 pixels, 4096 colors), 16 tone Polyphonic Ring tones, extra external LCD and a lot more. Fun. Now on to getting stuff from Panasonic, LG, Philips, Siemens. Ha!
