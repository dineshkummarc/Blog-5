Don't we all love ringtones? Now you can build your own. Florian [pointed me](http://florida.blogs.com/florida/2005/10/breed_your_own_.html) to [Wolfram Tones](http://tones.wolfram.com/generate/), a site build by [Wolfram Research](http://www.wolfram.com/), the people behind Mathematica. Stephen Wolfram published [A New Kind of Science](http://www.wolframscience.com/) recently, and WolframTones seems to be built via the findings of the book, which is either total idiocy or an amazing breakthrough in science. It was too thick for me when I picked it up in a book shop recently, and I put it back, but it is bound to be very interest. The interview I read with him some time back was very interesting indeed and with WolframTones they have developed something that  brings music to our ears based on the findings of New Kind of Science. Check out the page on [How WolframTones works](http://tones.wolfram.com/about/how.html). Very nice.
