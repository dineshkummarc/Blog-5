So we all know that porn companies know how to market their web sites. Agreed, they sell porn which makes it easier but they are leading the pack.

Now come casinos. They take privacy very serious and next to that have the most amazing databases.

*MGM Mirage can sort its 6TB of data on Microsoft Corp. SQL Server databases to tell you which of its 9 million customers are poker players who also like onions on their hamburgers. &quot;Whatever they do gets tracked and logged into the system,&quot; Bonner said. *

Just amazing.

*Unlike other companies, few casinos sell their customer data; it's more valuable kept close. &quot;We like to describe system criticality this way,&quot; said Charette. &quot;The systems are responsible for supporting $138,889 [in revenue] per hour.&quot; *
