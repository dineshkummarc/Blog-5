Those of you who use [OpenBC](http://www.openbc.com/) know that you can in the pro version see who visited your profile page. This is visibly via [this search](https://www.openbc.com/cgi-bin/search.fpl?op=list&amp;type=3). I presume it is one of the most visited pages on OpenBC and be it only for ego surfing. I have to say that you really do make contacts over that page as weird as it sounds. But now you don't have to check OpenBC every day, but you can just add the [RSS feed of the search](https://www.openbc.com/protect/cpvisits) to your feed reader. Thank you OpenBC. And for all those out there who are not connected to me yet, go [here for me OpenBC profile](https://www.openbc.com/hp/Oliver_Thylmann/) and connect, provided we know each other at least a little bit of course :)
