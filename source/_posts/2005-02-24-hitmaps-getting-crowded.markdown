You might have noticed (not if you only read the feed ;)) that I have a small map of the world on the left side of the blog with lots of red dots on it. That's actually [Hitmaps](http://hitmaps.open.ac.uk/) , a service by the the [Knowledge Media Institue](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/) at the Open University, which is showing where my visitors are coming from. This is a great and fun tool and very easy to install but it is getting to crowded, so I am removing it again. If you want to see the wonderful dots, check out [my website's world map](http://hitmaps.open.ac.uk/stats/owt.typepad.com-blog-/map-world.html) :)
