Loic [posted a quote](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2005/05/rupert_murdoch_.html) from the Economist in which Rupert Murdoch says that the newspapers will have to redically change and engage their readers a lot more to survive or rather to grow again. Interesting view point from a man that probably doesn't say something like this shooting from the hip.
