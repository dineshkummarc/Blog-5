[Neil](http://www.completetosh.com/) will be blogging the election right on the Guardian [Newsblog](http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news) and he is [getting ready for election night](http://www.completetosh.com/weblog/2004/10/getting_ready_f.html). This will be a fun blog to watch that night. Neil has the GMT 12am to 8am shift, which includes the time when the numbers are lifted.
