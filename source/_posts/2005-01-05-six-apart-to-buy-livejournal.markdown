&lt;p&gt;Om Malik has [an exclusive post](http://gigaom.com/2005/01/04/six-apart-to-buy-live-journal/) reporting that [Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/) is close to buying [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/)! Very big news there, which, if true, will make my [new years guess](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/happy_new_year.html) of Six Apart going public more likely. Remember that as of Alexa, TypePad is not at [place 765](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http://typepad.com) world wide, while Blogs.com (also TypePad) is [at place 2814](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http://blogs.com) and LiveJournal is at [place 565](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http://livejournal.com)! Some of the big sites out there seem to be moving together there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they would also get the people behind LiveJournal they would get some hell of a knowledge of keeping a big service scaling, some amazing open source applications and a good infrastructur. Just check out [danga.com](http://www.danga.com/) and check the [presentation from Brad (founder of LiveJournal) at Oscon 2004](http://www.danga.com/words/2004_oscon/) which gives a bit of detail on the LiveJournal Infrastructure, Memcached, tweaking MySQL, BigIP, lots of big hardware. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most of LiveJournal's users are using the service for free, Six Apart's [deal with Kanoodle](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/11/six_apart_is_bi.html) might allow them to monetize all that, if the LiveJournal users allow that. I would also be back where I started, because as I [posted beginning 2004](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/03/three_years_and.html), I started on LiveJournal beginning of 2001!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be an interesting match and I wish the best of luck to both teams to reach a good conclusion and get what they want out of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: [Rumors are true.](http://www.sixapart.com/log/2005/01/six_apart_acqui.shtml)
