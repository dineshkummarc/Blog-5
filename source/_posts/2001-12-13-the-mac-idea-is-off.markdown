I think I put the idea of getting a Mac off again. Mainly due to a money issue.

I recently built a PC for a friend:

- 1.2 Ghz Thunderbird CPU
- 512 MB RAM
- 40 Gig IBM harddisk
- CD-RW drive (40x,20x,10x if I remember correctly)
- DVD Drive
- 5.1 Surround Sound Card with Speakers from MS-Tech
- Network Card (100/10 mbit)
- 64 MB Geforce2

Price: about 900 EUR

I won't even get the cheapest iMac for that. I have to admit this does not include software but still. A good G4 costs 3400 EUR here at the moment. I couldn't even spend that in a PC shop in Aachen, well almost :)

I might still get one some time but at the moment I like working around on a desktop system too much. If I get a new laptop in half a year or a year or something then I still might think about it. Just might. But then I need a PowerBook as a need a PCMCIA card.

Oh boy, I have problems ;)
