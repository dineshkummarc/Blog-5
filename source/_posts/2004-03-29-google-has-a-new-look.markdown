I just went to [Google](http://www.google.com/) and what do I see? A new look? Well not really a new look but a few enhancements of the old look. For one, you can now see all the services they have including Google Answers and Blogger, which is about time! Google could almost be called a portal. All they need to do is integrate [Orkut](http://www.orkut.com/) and provide a login on the frontpage. I wonder if they will launch a new domain for that. Because Google is search, but what about portal.google.com? :) They also now have a big link to the [Google Advertiser Programs](http://www.google.com/ads/programs.html) right on the front page now.

&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; They also now have [DomainPark](http://www.google.com/domainpark/). Do you have unused domains that have 750k Impressions per month? Park them with DomainPark and earn money ;)
