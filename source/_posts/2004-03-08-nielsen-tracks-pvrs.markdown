The TV advertising business is changing faster than Nielsen thought, based on [this article](http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,62547,00.html) on Wired. The advertising industry is really in a big shift anyway, with more and more potential to really measure the effect of advertising and hence to allow them to calculate a ROI. This is true for Internet advertising and is coming more and more to other forms as well. I remember when looking at one of the low-cost airlines that they are simply putting different call-center numbers on different advertising to track everything from TV to posters at Metro stations.
