Actually this is a very cool game I have to say. I am part of a group beta testing a server based system and started playing today. Got of to a good start winning and then my third game (first crashed) stopped mid way. This was very challenging.

I will try to play this guy again, as he really seems to know what he is doing and I am looking forward to learning more about this. It is really challenging on the head and a good way to relax.

This is also something I was told some time ago driving from the Netherlands back to Aachen with a friend. Chess seems to be something that is used for relaxation by incubators for coders. Mostly because you need to concentrate and that gets your mind of the coding part a bit.

The last game was especially challenging because an advance was started on me really fast and I was mostly reacting, trying to get out of my seemingly bad position. Later I was told that my position wasn't so bad after all :)

One complaint though. Ok. We have a castle/tower. In German it is called Turm aka Tower. In english they called it rook. WHY?!?!?! It is a god damn tower. Why do they need to give it other names? To confuse me? Grrr... :)

( that mood list is too long ;))
