The project is showing it's first fruits. Some time ago, two wonderful people came over to the [Gojou](http://www.gojou.com/) offices (where I am currently sitting while planning the new enterprise) in search for some idea on blogging. They left the kid at home for the day and wanted to chat with [Ingmar](http://bornholz.typepad.com/) and me about this new and interesting trend. The thing is though, that their story was a lot more interesting and was perfect for getting them to start their own blog. I am talking about Paula, Meike and Volker Zetsche. Together they became what can now be found at [blog.diezetsches.de](http://blog.diezetsches.de/). Their writing in German and &quot;Die Zetsches&quot; is the kind of the German Version of &quot;The Osbornes&quot; :) At least that was where the idea of the name came from.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes their blogging so interesting? Paula is just one and a half years of and just said Papa the first time. Meike has been a marketing manager for companies and starting with the baby, has become self-employed, consulting companies in marketing and sales. Volker has been a member of the top management of the VOK DAMS Group, the lead german agency for live-marketing. The interesting part is the has because he has just taken a sabbatical and now the entire family is going to Afrika for several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, for those who can't read it, they are writing in german. But it will be an interesting tail and not only because I can relate so well having quite the same time as Volker. We had our first day in Freedom together, talking about blogs. :) The thing is that it's hard to adapt to not working anymore, and it's hard to leave your life for several months, and it's hard to do all that with a small kid, and it's hard to not fall in a hole. It will  be an interesting journey and the trip has already started. Looking forward to reading more from Meike and Volker. Teach Paula how to write please ;)
