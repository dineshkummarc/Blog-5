I have a further evolution of my [Rememberall](http://thylmann.net/blog/2009/8/15/the-evolution-of-my-rememberall.html). It's really staying mostly the same but I have added three things to further allow me to work efficiently. 

You have to remember that I am a text nut. I like stuff in plain text files. I like writing down stuff quickly and knowing its there somewhere without worrying where.

So one of those apps I added, via [MacBreak Weekly](http://twit.tv/mbw) or [TWiT](http://twit.tv/twit) I think, is [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/). It's a mouseless text entry system just made for quick text entry and retrieval. You have one search box, searching all your notes. Whenever you press enter a new note is created, when you press down you go into the list of notes. Simple as that. The fun extra thing is that you can tell Notational that it should store all texts in text files, which in my case get stored in a special directory that is synced to [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/). Oh the joy ;)

I have been working with notes like that for some time, but mostly in TextMate. The thing that is missing is easy access to the notes from the iPhone. Welcome [Simplenote](http://simplenoteapp.com/)! It's a website where you can write text files and see them and they have an iPhone app and an API. Hence, now my Notational Velocity Syncs with Simplenote on my iPhone, and thanks to the pro Account all text files are backuped and I got an email I can simply send stuff to and have it converted into a Simplenote. I can also get an RSS Feed from my Notes. Oh the joy! :)

So finally I have the solution I needed to have my written notes with me all the time. 

The other one I just bought for the iPhone is [Momento](http://www.momentoapp.com/). It's not perfect yet but it is going in the right directly. It is kind of a personal diary but the nice thing is that it can backup all your twitter items and flickr items and last.fm items. Now I am not using last.fm that much, but this really makes me wonder. I already suggested to the developer that they integrate more services and make me pay one by one. I would happily do that for Foursquare for example to add location to the diary. It might also solve my full backup bit.

Oh the joy! ;)

But I am repeating myself.
