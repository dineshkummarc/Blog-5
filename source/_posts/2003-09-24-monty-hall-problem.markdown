Actually a good page about &lt;a title=&quot;The Infamous Monty Hall Problem&quot; href=&quot;http://www.comedia.com/hot/monty.html&quot;&gt;The Infamous Monty Hall Problem. Seems a bit clear at least, even though you have to factor in that Monty knows that he will open a bad door. But still. Just got this from [Simon Guest](http://simonguest.com/), *the only guy at Microsoft allowed to log in as 'guest' as he puts it ;)
