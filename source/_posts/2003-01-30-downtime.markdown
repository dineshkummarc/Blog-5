Today, once again, there was a considerable downtime from the part of the company that hosts these pages. It seems that they did not renew some kind of license on the servers that they are using. Not really the most brilliant thing to happen. This thing has been going up and down several times now and sadly they don't seem to monitor that it's down, or at least they don't notice. Of course, a full virtual server for $9 per month with 1Gig of space and full root access is something that is rather nice. Let's see how this goes on.
