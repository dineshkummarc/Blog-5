[Amr Awadallah](http://www.awadallah.com/blog/) posted a [great analysis](http://www.awadallah.com/blog/?p=19) of why Google will miss their Q4 2005 numbers, including betting on it by shorting the stock. I would love for real analysts to do that too. And I agree with him in many respects. Looking forward to the Google Numbers on January 31st.
