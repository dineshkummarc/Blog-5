&lt;p&gt;Currently the blogosphere is linking to &lt;a title=&quot;EPIC 2014&quot; href=&quot;http://hyku.com/epic/&quot;&gt;EPIC 2014&lt;/a&gt; which is talking about the future of media in a wonderful way. Googlezon is the merger of Google and Amazon, after Google bought TiVo by the way. Welcome EPIC. Cool stuff, a little bit scary and very insightful and thought provoking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I am at it, SiliconBeat [links to](http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2004/11/19/why_google_wins_with_users.html) a [post](http://www.mediapost.com/dtls_dsp_SearchInsider.cfm?fnl=041118) on MediaPost which talks about why Google is winning and I have been saying that without end to people around me. This is why Google is understanding! They even talk about it in their conference calls to investors. First comes a service that attracts users and when there are millions of them then they think about monetizing it without destroying the idea behind it. All this EPIC stuff would be good for the user, as long as some other stuff in there does not happen. This makes the challenge interesting, as good for the user might not equate good for society at large. That's probably the next step.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
