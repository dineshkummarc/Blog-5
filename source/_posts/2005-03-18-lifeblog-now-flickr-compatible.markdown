Russ just [posted](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008375.html) that there is now a [Flickr Lifeblog tool](http://www.flickr.com/tools/lifeblog), meaning you can theoretically use Lifeblog with Flickr... then again, theoretically, as Lifeblog doesn't work with the 6600 and hence I can't try it out or write about it. From what I've seen it's nice. The phone app could probably be compared a bit with ecto. You can post via the TypePad web interface but sometimes ecto is just nicer. I have to agree with Russ though as I wouldn't use the desktop version, having just gotten a new 15&quot; Powerbook.
