Scott Blum, 38, buy.com
He's ba-a-ack! In 1999, Blum sold his controlling interest in buy.com, the discount e-tailer he founded, to a Japanese investment bank for $230 million. &quot;I got ridiculed for selling,&quot; he says, &quot;but I felt the market was getting out of control. The company was trading at a $5 billion market cap.&quot; The bubble soon burst, and in late 2001 a deep-pocketed Blum was able to buy the now-profitable company back for a mere $26 million.
