There you go. The [les blogs 2.0 preliminary program](http://lesblogs.typepad.com/blog/2005/10/les_blogs_20_pr.html) is out and looks mighty interesting. I will miss the opening remarks, Robert Scoble and Shel Israel, first Networking Break and possibly parts of the first blogging panel. But I do hope to be there at the networking lunch sponsored by [Fon](http://www.fon.es/). The program looks great and Loic already put a Wiki up [here](http://www.socialtext.net/loicwiki/member/index.cgi?lesblogs20). Go contribute.
