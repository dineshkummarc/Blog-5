There are some [great photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/lesblogs/) from Les Blogs on Flickr, but some of the best are available in [Guido van Nispen's set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/10508572@N00/sets/271987/) in black and white! It's wonderful to see such a great shot of your friends. [Here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/10508572@N00/11042476/in/set-271987) are Ingmar and David obviously getting ready for the show. Thanks for the shots Guido!
