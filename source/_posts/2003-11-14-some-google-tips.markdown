I just read an article about some Google Tips and wanted to share some of them with all of you out there, because some are really nice.





1. Use the Google Preferences. They allow you to say that you want all search results to open in a new window and to show 20 results on one page for example. Very convenient.

2. If you send arround Google URLs, then you can use &lt;a&gt;TinyURL to make them shorter. Knew that one already but still good to have it standing here.

3. Google has a calculator. Just use the search bar, including brackets and everything. This was actually done by somebody who was supposed to write a language tool. I might have quoted that already here some time though.

4. They are pointing to [Google Alert](http://www.googlealert.com) which I am already using happily. 

5. They list the Google URL Parameters, something that might come in handy for parsing the URL once in a while. 
- &amp;: All parameters are seperated by this value
- as_q: used between words as AND
- num: Number of items per result page
- hl: language of the Google page you are using
- btnG: Text of the Search Button
- as_epq: Search for exact match
- as_oq: when OR is used in the search
- as_eq: NOT
- Ir: Only search in one language
- as_ft: Option to include (i) or exclude (e) certain file types
- as_filetype: only search for that filetype
- as_qdr: only search for a specific amount of time (all, m3, y)
- as_occt: gives the position of the search term on the page
- as_dt: to exclude a domain
- as_sitesearch: exclude or only search on one domain

6. Google Dance will soon be a thing of the past, as Google will be updating continuously, something I can confirm from a recent search engine conference. This is partly due to improvements in the indexing machanism and in the amount of pages they can index.

7. With the help of the search parameter &quot;intitle:&quot; you can search for things in the title only. There is also inurl: intext: inanchor:

8. To use hidden features try [Google Ultimate Interface](http://www.faganfinder.com/google.html).

Those are just a few of the tips but some nice ones.
