I didn't want to post about this as there are enough people talking about it and because it seems to crush me just thinking about it too much. But there is an article on the NY Times that has an image on the right that is a must see.

[Spain Struggles to Absorb Worst Terrorist Attack in Its History](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/11/international/europe/11CND-TRAI.html?hp)

The picture shows people standing on big public place in Seville/Spain holding up their hands with their palms out.  I'll just add the quotation: 

*Thousands of people gathered at the New Square in Seville, Spain, to protest the terrorist attacks in Madrid. Demonstrators there held up their hands as a signal to stop*

Very powerful.
