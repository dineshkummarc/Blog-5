I have been talking about the power of WebService APIs to some extent here and really believe in the coming of Web 2.0. There are so many opporuntinies in there it is amazing. And now I see [John Battelle's post about the Web 2.0 lineup](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000830.php) and boy will this be an amazing conference!!! I would love to be there! Somebody want to invite me to Web 2.0? :) Is it blogged? Are there feeds? Can I follow it from Germany? The [Web 2.0 FAQ](http://web2con.com/pub/w/32/faq.html) states that this conference is for the &quot;business geek&quot;. Hell, my nickname is bizkiffer, given to me because I seem to be taking in business/business_it books in like other people pot. :) You can check out more about the program [here](http://web2con.com/pub/w/32/program.html). To the attendees: I want a blog and a wiki :) I hope I can count on [Ross](http://ross.typepad.com/) for the wiki :)

**Update**: My wish has been answered and I just read that [Ross will set up an Eventspace](http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2004/08/web20_eventspac.html) based on [Socialtext](http://www.socialtext.com/) for the Conference. Now it only remains to be whether this will be public and/or if it will be active. Thanks Ross.
