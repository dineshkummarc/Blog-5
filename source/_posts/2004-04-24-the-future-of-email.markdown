Thijs has some interesting thoughts on [the current state and future of eMail](http://blog.taospace.com/2004/04/putting_real_th.html) and I have to agree that there are some interesting things out there, like Zoe, and CLucene does sound interesting too in general. The best eMail clients still needs to be built and there is a lot that can be done. He has some interesting thoughts to start with.
