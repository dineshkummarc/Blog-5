I never ever signed up for [Friendster](http://www.friendster.com/). I don't know why. Especially because now I have LinkedIn and OpenBC accounts (and an Orkut account which I hardly use). But anyway. Friendster [fired Joyce Park](http://troutgirl.com/blog/index.php?/archives/46_Shitcanned.html) because of her blogging. As a blogger, Joyce talked about the switch to PHP for Friendster, got Slashdotted and in general got a good amount of attention. But she really didn't reveal anything secret.

Now the bloggers fight back. Oh the fun :) Jeremy Zawodny started it and is now asking everyone to cancel their Friendster Accounts ([see here](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/002498.html)) with the reason: &quot;Fireing employees for blogging&quot;. Now go cancel your account :)
