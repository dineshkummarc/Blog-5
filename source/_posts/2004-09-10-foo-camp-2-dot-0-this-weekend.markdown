This weekend is bound to be interesting. I just [read on Jeremy Zawodny's blog](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/002552.html) that FOO Camp 2.0 is starting this weekend. Next to Web 2.0 another one I'd like to be at. Thank god for bloggers ;)

**Update**: The wonderful Russel Beattie has set up [FooTV](http://3gp.us/), which will be a moblogged video feed of the event ... kind of. Cool :)

**Update 2**: We need directional mics on mobile phones or stuff like FooTV won't make it. You can't understand a thing.
