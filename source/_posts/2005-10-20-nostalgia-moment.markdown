Ok, I just had a real nostalgia moment. I listened to [Adam Curry](http://www.curry.com/)'s [Daily Source Code](http://www.dailysourcecode.com/) and he ran the standard Hit Test (#66) by [Jan Polet](http://www.janpolet.com/) which this time included a walk down memory lane to one of his broadcasts of 1992 and the number one spot back than was ... Mr. Big! Boy oh boy, were those the days :) Listening to Mr. Big and playing drums in a band... fun moments.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
