In case you missed it, starting January 1st, Brazil is making every American citizen traveling to Brazil will have his photo and finger prints taken. Brazil simply says that every Brazilian has to do that too when they travel to the US. A judge ordered that :) Good move if you ask me. Now an airline pilot made obszene gestures when his picture was taken. They entire crew was then arrested and now that the airline has to pay a 10.000 EUR penalty for that. :)
