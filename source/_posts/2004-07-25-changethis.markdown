Joi [made me aware](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/07/21/seth_godins_changethis.html) of [ChangeThis](http://www.changethis.com/), which is starting something that I do really like. The thing is that blogs just publish short bursts of thoughts but do not provide detailed analysis. If you post detailed analysis it is often not even fully read because it doesn't fit the short bursts mentality. Now with ChangeThis, the founders are providing a platform for serious thought that builds on the Creative Commons idea in that I can republish the document. It's like getting great authors without a platform and a platform without authors together. NY Times without the backend. It's be interesting, but I feel like there is still more to be done with leveraging RSS and Blogs. We need a way to interconnect all the different blogs and voices to make a bigger picture automatically via the many  voices that we can find. Maybe autosummaries like possible on any text document on the Mac, coupled with Technorati and subject searches, might enable that.
