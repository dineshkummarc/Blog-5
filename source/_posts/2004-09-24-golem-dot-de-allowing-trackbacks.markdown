As I just read on agenturblog.de (German post: [Golem.de erlaubt Trackbacks](http://www.agenturblog.de/archives/2004/09/golemde_erlaubt.html)), it seems that [Golem.de](http://www.golem.de/) a big german online it news site now allows trackbacks to their articles, putting the info of the trackbacks right in there next to the comment and linking to the Blog. Very nice indeed and I am looking forward to seeing other news sites do that. Thank you for the bold step Golem.de :)
