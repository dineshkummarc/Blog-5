Well, I thought we are at war now, kind of, so I should educate myself a bit on the subject. Sitting in front of my is by &quot;Carl von Clausewitz - Vom Krieg&quot;, which translates to &quot;on war&quot; or something. The book goes into the natur of war, theory of war, about strategy in general and a lot more. Bound to be interesting.

But I figure quoting amazon will once again be easiest to explain the book I haven't read yet ;)

&lt;I&gt;On War is the most significant attempt in Western history to understand war, both in its internal dynamics and as an instrument of policy. Since the work's first appearance in 1832, it has been read throughout the world, and has stimulated generations of soldiers, statesmen, and intellectuals. &lt;/I&gt;

Get it [here](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691018545/bizkiffer-20).

As we are talking about book, I also got a german one called Adler und Engel by Juli Zeh. It's said to be very good as of a review in &quot;Die Zeit&quot;. I had another book in my hands too but it was a bit too hard to read at the time. I think I will get it later when I am more in the mode for a heavy masterpiece of 800 pages. :) 

I am still looking for people who have all the 4 harry potter books. I read the first one and it rocks and now I want to read the others ones but I am not yet convinced that I want to buy them. hmm... I should. Ahhh.. damn :)

Also got [SSX Snowboard](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004U5VS/bizkiffer-20) for the [Playstation 2](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NGMG/bizkiffer-20). The game rocks rocks rocks ... well there are also trees to run into but it still rocks. Watch the rocks! :)
