I just got this and thought I'd translate it to english.

The question is the following:
You are driving in your car late at night with a storm outside. You are passing a bus stop and see three people waiting.
1. An old lady, who looks as if she would soon die.
2. An friend who saved your life once.
3. The girl/guy of your dreams

Your dilemma. You have a two seating roadster and can only take one person. You can also not come back to the station once you left.

Who will you take. 

This was used for a work test for stock market brokers it seems. Once you thought about it, read on.



The one that got the job (amongst 200 people) chose this:

&quot;I would give the guy that saved my life the car and ask him to take the old lady to the hospital. Then I would wait for the bus with the girl of my dreams.&quot;

The moral is that we need to think out of the box, as they say.
