Had a good night out today. Yesterday was more something for sitting in front of the television watching stupid things and relaxing. Today we went to eat at a Brauhaus in Cologne. The place is run by students and they still make their own beer. Very nice one I would like to add and they only sell it there. I think it was called Hennes.

Their white beer tasts a little stale sometimes but otherwise is very good. Their strong bear was not there so I settled for Koelsch (attention the real letter here which is german and is what oe stands for, the o with the two dots above, does not work in livejournal :)) which is the beer you drink in Cologne (german name Koeln). It is really good there.

Anyway. Next to us was a very interesting table. something like 16 15 year old girls and one 35 year old guy. Interesting mix. Later 3 16 year old boys joined them though. There most interesting part for me was that they had a really cool phone. I sadly did not ask them which one it was but I will find out. I presume it was a japanese I-Mode phone. Something like the motorola star tac but a bit bigger and with color screen. Those things are really cool. Buy is japan more advanced then we are :)

We also had some very nice talks at our table. One of the couples is getting married soon and it is fun seeing them talk about what they still need to do. There are so many things to pay attention to really. Sadly I am too late to get the bride to wear a really sexy wedding dress. I gave some suggestions at an earlier meeting but I might be a bit over the top there. It would be really nice but maybe a bit too sexy. She agreed though that it might really look nice and will keep me in the loop for her choice.

It is weird. There are many people among my friends at the moment that seem to get married now or have just married. Something that I might really have to look into ;)

I still have to take a look for some jobs for people that work in hotels. Boy do they have a bad salary. It is amazing. There just seem to be too many people there that can do the job. Cooks earn quiet well though, especially if you are good. The point is probably that you can make yourself a name if you are good and then the hotel needs you kind of. They just cannot let you leave. That puts you in a very good position. So if you want to go into that direction, become a cook. 

And if you are in Cologne, go to the Hennes :)
