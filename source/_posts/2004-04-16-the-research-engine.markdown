Damn this fits in so many ways. I am slowly starting to warm up to [A9](http://a9.com/), Amazon's new search engine, which I would actually call ReSearch Engine. This is not the thing you use for everyday searches really. I would still prefer Google as the results are a bit clearer it seems. But just imagine doing some research on a given subject. A [search for Capital Asset Pricing Model](http://a9.com/Capital%20Asset%20Pricing%20Model) will also give you some book results for example. This might be very helpful. You can also look at the information Amazon has about sites via Alexa, which is also nice. And as a nice word play, ReSearch Engine is not only about research, but also about ReSearch, searching again, as Amazon logs your searches. Nice again. And yes, they know what I search for and can use that to suggest books. But hey, I will just not do all my porn searches on there then ;)
