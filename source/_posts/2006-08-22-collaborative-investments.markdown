TechCrunch [writes](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/21/socialpicks-enables-collaborative-investment-research/) about [socialPicks](http://socialpicks.com/about/beta), a web service that is a community of investors that work together to find the best picks. This is actually something I think all the companies that have user portfolios like [OnVista](http://onvista.de/) need to get into. Remember that these web sites have huge amounts of portfolios of their users and could easily find the best performing ones. Building a special investment fund based on that seems to me to be easy enough. You could analyze best performance of those people that are trading on at least 1 share a month (only active accounts) over a given period just to start with. If you then take into account social interactions, ratings of companies, ratings of portfolios, best-of lists, discussions, digg like features, you are really getting into a new kind of portfolio that people might even want to mirror.
