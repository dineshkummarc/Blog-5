I finally found an application for the iBook that lets me scan the airwaves for 802.11b aka Wifi networks whereever I am. The nice thing is that it works without any big changes in the system and is a graphical OS X application. Simply wonderful. [Check it out](http://www.macstumbler.com/)! And while I am at it, [EtherPEG](http://www.etherpeg.com) is a tool that lets you monitor your ethernet port for GIFs and JPEGs. You can recompile it for connecting to the AirPort port and then when you are in a nice network with lots of people this might be a fun thing to watch :)
