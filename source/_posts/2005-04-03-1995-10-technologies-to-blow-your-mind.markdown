Think back to 1995 and then look at what we have today. Mindboggling. Neil McIntosh has a great post entitled [Ten technologies to blow your 1995 mind](http://www.completetosh.com/weblog/2005/03/1995_ten_techno.html) listing the ones he found. Here is the short list:

* 2Mb broadband
* WiFi in your home (to a 2Mb broadband connection ;))
* Google
* .Mac (or actually WebDAV and a 2GB spaced server for a small fee that I am using for it)
* Flickr
* eMail on every business card
* iPod
* Skype
* Ikea's new wardrobe door hinges

Just imagine where we can be in another 10 years. VoIP will have killed standard telephones in a big way. Bandwidth will be virtually free and your power consumption will be the measure of the day in hosting centers. Broadcatching will bring you the latest movies and series to your home automatically. Social networking will be embedded in lots of things allowing you to find out more things more easily. Digital paper will give you your newspaper with blogs and everything at your finger tips via OLED displays that simply unfold. You will not even think about not being online. I will get a Golf Handicap below 10. Mindboggling :)
