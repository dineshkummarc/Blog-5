I wanted to post about this yesterday but it fell through the cracks, now [Martin confirms it](http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/fon/fonero-promise-in-germany.html). End of next week the Fonera will cost 29 EURs. So if you want to get your fonera for free, I suggest you go at it now. You have a few days left until you will not get it for free anymore.

There will soon be thousands of Foneras in Germany, and hundreds of thousands all over the world. It makes absolute sense to share your nocat. I am sharing it at two places already and if I knew somebody at the airport I would give them 10 and make them a Bill. Sadly I don't. If you do, go out and get some.

You might just want to have a chat with [Fon](http://fon.com) directly if you believe you can set up a few restaurants in the city center. Check out the &quot;[SuperBill Aktion](http://blog.fon.com/de/archive/events/fon-startet-superbill-aktion.html)&quot; in Germany.[ ](http://blog.fon.com/de/archive/events/fon-startet-superbill-aktion.html)
