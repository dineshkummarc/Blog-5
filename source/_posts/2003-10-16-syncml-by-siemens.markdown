You can now use [Siemens' SyncML Service](http://www.my-siemens.com/MySiemens/CDA/Index/0,1046,HQ_en_0_cms%253A7862,00.html) if you have a supported Siemens phone to sync you callendar and contacts from anywhere. Very nice. I actually already mailed [Oddpost](http://www.oddpost.com/) to suggest to them to add that to their online mail client. This would make the tool close to perfect.
