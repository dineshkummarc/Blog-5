Now [this is nice](http://fscklog.typepad.com/fsck/2004/03/die_ichat_av_fa.html). It seems that those on the iChat Images of Apple were at the San Francisco store opening and Apple left their Airport Basestations over night so people could go online. People even put up their cars at the curbe so laptops could be charged. Now this is dedication of customers :)
