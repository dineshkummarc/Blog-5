If you want to know what is happening in the mobile space and also what Nokia is doing there, I highly suggest listening to the feeds from [Nokia Connection 2004](http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,6771,58956,00.html). What strikes me as interesting is that Nokia people sound more edgy in the presentations, more nervous if you want. There is less calm and less excitedness at the same time. You don't feel any real confidence anymore. I still think they are on the right track, and they are best positioned to reap the benefits of the move to a more mobile world, but hey, what do I know? ;)

Anway. Another exciting part is that in the second bit, that started at 1300, you can hear a speach by [Joi](http://joi.ito.com/) who talks a bit about mobility, interesting the user, changes in advertising and content. Very nice indeed. I actually have to admit that it made me understand why he invested and works at Six Apart and Technorati. If all he says is true, which seems at least likely, then these kinds of pages will be at the center of attention for a lot of users. Or rather, blogs will and Technorati will help building the possibility for interaction for marketers of the future. Very interesting indeed.
