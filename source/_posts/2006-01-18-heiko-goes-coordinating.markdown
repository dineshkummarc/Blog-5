Now that's a big one, [Heiko](http://www.hebig.com/) is leaving [Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/) and Hamburg, going to [Hubert Burda Media](http://www.hubert-burda-media.com/) in Munich. He will be their Coordinator of Media Development, which sounds like a great title. I presume he will be looking at all the new stuff, playing with all the new stuff, and I am looking forward to seeing him at [DLD06](http://www.dld06.com/) to congratulate him personally. He might have left some stock options on the table, but he is moving into a position where he can change the worlds. Congratulations. His post about it is [here](http://www.hebig.com/archives/003609.shtml).
