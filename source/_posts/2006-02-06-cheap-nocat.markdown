Ejovi has a good post entitled [Community Internet?](http://www.ejovi.net/2006/02/02/community-internet/) showing what can be possible with the help of a movement like FON. His idea is to internet enable harlem via giving away FON enabled nocat routers for people that have internet access, giving free access to all that want to. This could really bring the Internet to a lot more people.

If you put your mind to it, this can be an interesting methodology in a lot of places. Great thoughts.
