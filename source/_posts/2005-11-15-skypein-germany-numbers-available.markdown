Just read [via Heiko](http://www.hebig.com/archives/003500.shtml) that SkypeIn numbers for Germany are now available. More about the process is [here](http://www.skypejournal.com/blog/archives/2005/11/skypein_for_germany_with_a_twist.php) and I can confirm that the process went through in a few minutes. Sadly you can't choose your number, but still, I now have a US  and a  Germany phone number via Skype. The other thing I just learnt, via their help line, is that you can get a [Base](http://www.base.de/) subscription which will give you a 25 EUR phone flatrate on your mobile phone and add on their ePlus UMTS flatrate for EUR 40 which Skype recently [posted about](http://share.skype.com/blog/skype_around_the_world/skype_on_german_e-plus_3g_network_for_40_euro_flat_rate/). 65 EURs for a phone and data flatrate in Germany. If Skype could please come out with a Symbian Skype client? :)

**Update:** It [seems](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/66622) that Base is planning at 25EUR UMTS Flatrate. Rock on.
