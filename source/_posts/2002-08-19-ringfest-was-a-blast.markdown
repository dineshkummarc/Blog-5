Well. Ringfest in Cologne is once again over and this time was fun too. Again very very full and while I wanted to go on Sunday, I didn't want to leave the appartment other than for the pool, which proved to be challenging ;)

I had fun looking at a bit of nice stuff at the RTL stage on saturday ([Video here](http://www.rtl.de/musik/759337.html)) but most of the time was spent at the Evian stage. Not because the music was better (mostly charty pop stuff), but because we got backstage passes there, which ment access to 3 double decker busses overlooking the crowd (no trying to find a spot with little people to see the stage ;)) as well as access to well ... backstage, with free drinks. Sadly the massage spots were for other people only. There were Guest passes (ours), V.I.P, Artist, Crew, Production and A.A.A. (Access All Areas). Only A.A.A. (obviously), V.I.P and Artist got a massage. The fun thing was that the V.I.P passes were gold, ours were white and the Crew passes were Silver. Hmmm... so if bad comes to worse, crew goes, V.I.P. stays? ;)

Here is some stuff from the Eins Live Stage (big radio station) from [Saturday](http://www.einslive.de/diemusik/diesendungen/popkomm_ringfest/eins_live_buehne__samstag__17._august/index.phtml) and [Sunday](http://www.einslive.de/diemusik/diesendungen/popkomm_ringfest/eins_live_buehne__sonntag__18._august/index.phtml). Their stage is huge but the place is just too packed and it takes too much time to get in. Somehow I need to find somebody with backstage passes for that one next time. I need to get a press pass that somehow gets me in to _everything_. Otherwise it is just plain useless ;). Oh, remember, Ringfest is a free thingie with 2.5 million people in cologne last year over the weekend.
