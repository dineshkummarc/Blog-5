[Teemow](http://teemow.com/) just [linked](http://teemow.com/2006/07/19/elevator-pitches/) to the [elevator pitches](http://blog.vpod.tv/2006/07/thenextweb_conf.html) from the next web conference, which Atlas Ventures allowed entrepreneurs to have. Sadly we couldn't be there, building a product and all, but it was interesting to see. Looking forward to having our pitch sometime, out of interest how it goes.
