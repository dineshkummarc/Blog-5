Now this a 3G phone! UMTS, or WCDMA rather as UMTS is just the mix of settings in Europe employing WCDMA in the radio network, here we come! Check out the Nokia 7600.

Looks a lot more interesting than the previous ones we have seen doesn't it? And it's coming out in 2003, as Nokia puts it. More about this can be found in the [press release](http://press.nokia.com/PR/200309/918609_5.html).
