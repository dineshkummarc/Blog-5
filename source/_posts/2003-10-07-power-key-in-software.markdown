Well... it seems that the power key on the Palm Tungsten T uses some kind of software to work because it didn't work and now, after a hard reset it does. Strangely enough you need the power button for the hard reset to work, which didn't work (the power button that is) but the hard reset worked. I don't think that I need to understand that. :)
