With the start of my financial strategy course I need to find out how to add formulas to my HTML code in [this blog](http://www.ennead.de/ou/). This will turn out to be interesting ... and lots to read. I actually thought MathML would be a good solution but after [this article](http://tech.irt.org/articles/js208/index.htm) I am not to sure anymore and [this article](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/math/) talks about some other forms including the use of CSS. All in all, using simple images seems more and more clever, even though I do not want to use a million images and I actually want to indexed. So please, if anyone has a simple solution, I am all ears. In the meantime, [this is pretty nice](http://www.unics.uni-hannover.de/nhtcapri/mathematics.html) even if it gets really scary if you look at the source code ;)
