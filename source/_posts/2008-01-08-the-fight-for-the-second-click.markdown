[Good article](http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&amp;art_aid=73436) that nicely sums up what Google is currently looking into. In short, they are looking at having more content, which ends up in the search engine, and can have place for AdSense ads. Why send traffic to Wikipedia who refuse to take ads from Google when you can direct them to Blogger or rather something more Wikipedia like that has. I am not saying that they will hack the algorythm to put their own properties on top, but the problem runs deeper.

As soon as Google has their own properties, people are bound to question whether they are not artificially improving their own ranks. Whether they do or not is not important there. This is really the same reason that I believe Google will have a hard time going deeply into the lead generation business, in the sense that they launch generic information pages on subjects where people can register, selling those leads on, similar to how we do it. Whenever somebody else bids on a per click basis, people will be wondering whether Google does not artificially increase their conversion rates and get their own sites into the ad spots.

Getting a bit tricky here, but there do seem to be limits to what Google can do and they are just testing those limits out. Stuff will remain interesting.
