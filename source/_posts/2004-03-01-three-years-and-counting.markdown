Wow, it's now [over three years since I started blogging](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2001/02/journal_created.html). Quite some time, started at [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/) (how come they are so big and silent???), moved to my own server, changed to [MovableType](http://www.movabletype.org/) there and then on to [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com/). I am currently playing with [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/) but I doubt it will make me move away from TypePad.

It has been a great experience doing this and I learned a lot in the process and, even though I stopped a bit from time to time, I went over that one threshold that makes you not want to stop anymore. This is to another three years and more!
