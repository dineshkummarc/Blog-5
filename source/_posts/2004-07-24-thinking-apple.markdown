Check out the folling on MacCentral: &lt;a title=&quot;Long lines await iPod mini's Tokyo debut&quot; href=&quot;http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/2004/07/24/ipodminitokyo/&quot;&gt;Long lines await iPod mini's Tokyo debut.

This is why I am suddenly starting to think that buying Apple stock isn't such a bad idea really. They have done well in the last few months but their P/E is now amazingly high. Still. There is some music in the business, and there likely is some music in the stock too. I am not the last one to recognize that though, which makes it a bit unlikely that this is the investment of the century.
