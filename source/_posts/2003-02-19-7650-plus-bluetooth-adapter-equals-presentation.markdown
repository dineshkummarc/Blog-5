This is a nice one on infoSync: &lt;a title=&quot;Powerpoint viewing on Series 60&quot; href=&quot;http://www.infosync.no/news/2002/n/3096.html&quot;&gt;Powerpoint viewing on Series 60. With the help of a Bluetooth presentation adaption, which hooks up to the beamer, you will be able to handle your presentations with nothing but a 7650. How cool can you get? ... Hmm... I could do that on my Tungsten too. Fun.
