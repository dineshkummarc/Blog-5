Yes, it's all in the right type, because DART in this case is &lt;a title=&quot;Online Advertising, Email Marketing, Database Marketing and Marketing Analytics Solutions&quot; href=&quot;http://www.doubleclick.com/us/&quot;&gt;DoubleClick's Ad-Server solution and I am starting to grasp the design and have worked with it a little bit at this time. It's a pretty powerful tool and you I am starting to wonder which other wonderful little things one could do with it. I mean HTML Banners could be just parts of web sites really, who ever said that HTML banners need to be clickable or in the form of a banner. This might get interesting.
