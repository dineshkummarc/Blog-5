This is one of the books that has been on my shelf for a long time now, unfinished, as I just do not have the head free enough to read it. I do love the book though. What I love most about it is the introduction by [Laurence Freeman OSB](http://www.google.com/search?q=Laurence+Freeman+OSB&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8), a Benedictine monk and Spiritual guide of the World Community for Christian Meditation. His words are amazing and he gave me a new viewpoint on relgion. This is not to downplay the real part of the book but these 60 pages are wonderful to read and amazingly insightful.

The rest is really a Bible reading of the Dalai Lama, his comments as well as some questions and answers sessions. As I mentioned above, I have not finished reading it yet, mainly because you can't just read this. It makes you think, it makes your mind move to interesting places and you tend to get caught up in it. This is not a book to take lightly and you need to give it the time it deserves. I didn't and still don't have that time at this moment.

If you are interested in religion, especially christianity, thinking about other religions, than this is something for you. It will show how very similar the different religions really are. The german version I have is entitled &lt;I&gt;Dalai Lama: Das Herz aller Religionen ist eins. Die Lehre Jesu aus buddhistischer Sicht&lt;/I&gt;.
