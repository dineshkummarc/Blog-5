Nice Summary on the About.com acquisition on Hypergene Mediablog entitled [What's all the fuss About.com?](http://www.hypergene.net/blog/weblog.php?id=P255). Just a point though. at 22 Million Visitors a month, with 10 Views per Visitor (just an assumption, that's 220 Million page impressions per month. I personally think that's whay to low, and looking at their [page view numbers from alexa.com](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=1y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=p&amp;url=http://about.com#top), I gather they are more about 1 billion in monthly page impressions (to be conservative). This bring us in at 12 billion page impressions per year, meaning they need to get an average TKP of $34.41 for the entire year for all the revenue to be back in. With the content they have. They obviously can't make that but $3.4 over 10 years (without a discount factor for easy of calculations ;)) seems to be very doable with the rise of performance advertising which really does not have such a volume problem. And this doesn't factor in all the knowledge within About.com staff and systems. Good buy I'd say.
