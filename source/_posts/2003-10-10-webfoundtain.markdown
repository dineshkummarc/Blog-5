[Webfountain](http://www.almaden.ibm.com/webfountain/) is something coming out of the IBM Research Labs that is already used by several big companies. Webfountain is a search engine which uses artificial intelligence to understand the deeper meaning behind web pages. It is currently mostly used to find out how a new digital camera is being excepted, or how many albums a popstar is likely to sell. 300 Researchers are working on the Project at IBM. This is said to be like &quot;Google on Steroids&quot;. I'd like to try that one :)
