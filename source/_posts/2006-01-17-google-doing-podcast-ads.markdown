Now [PodShow](http://www.podshow.com/) will have to have a very clear business model. Google has [bought](http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2006/01/17/google-sells-the-world/) (or is about to) [dMarc Broadcasting](http://www.dmarcbroadcasting.com/), a company that has a technological solution to handle advertising on radio. Very well and congratulations. I haven't looked closely at the company yet but one thing seems clear. Add Google's expertise, dMarc's access to customers and radio expertise and you have a powerful AdWords driven Podcasting ads engine. Seems like Podcasting might get itself a very cool player. Looking forward to see how this unfolds.

**Update**: [Here](http://www.byte.org/blog/_archives/2006/1/17/1682336.html) is somebody not believing in the podcasting bit. my short rebuttal. Google is doing this for the customer access, the technology behind it, the potential to do radio advertising AND to have good assets with large insight from radio advertising to be able to play well in the podcasting market once it starts to grow, which it is already doing.
