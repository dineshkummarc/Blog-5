Some new updates from Google. [Inside AdSense is reporting](http://adsense.blogspot.com/2005/11/gain-more-advertisers-right-from-your.html) that they enabled a new feature call [Online Advertiser Signup](http://www.google.com/services/oasu/). John [nails it](http://battellemedia.com/archives/002050.php) in saying that this is really good for the smaller publishers out there and I'd like to elaborate a little bit on this.

The thing is that publishers need a banner server for their site, in general, but this costs them money, something like 10 cents CPM for example if you are big and have several million ad impressions. This is if you go with some of the big guys like [Doubleclick](http://www.doubleclick.net/)'s DFP (dart for publishers) or [Falk eSolutions AG](http://www.falk-ag.de/) or lots of others. But if you are unsold, then this is just a cost you are adding up and a small site is probably unsold for the most part. Thanks to AdSense you can now be always (almost) fully booked. This is good, because advertising inventory is perishable inventory, and as long as your prices are not inflated, being fully booked should be good, driving up the prices in the end. With this new feature you can go AdSense only! Yes, you will forgo the margin that Google takes out but you will not have the &quot;hassle&quot; to make sure that you are making more money with that new advertiser. For bigger publishers that sucks because they might want to have a good relation with a customer and want to give him a few clicks extra, but that doesn't work with the AdSense model (which is why Publishers, the big ones will need to go another route, also more on this another time).

So now all you need is an AdWords WebService Bit over which you can manage your own Customers, through your own interface. Sounds very likely and would allow AdSense to further eat itself into the publisher world.

Very fitting to this update [JenSense.com is reporting](http://www.jensense.com/archives/2005/11/separate_biddin.html) that AdWords publishers can now bid separately  on the search and content network of Google. Good stuff happening out there.
