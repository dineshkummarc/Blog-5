After visiting [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com/) several times and thinking about it again and again I finally took the leap and added [my FeedBurner feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/owt). The old feeds are still valid but there are several nice things about this new one. For one it will work with any feed reader and you don't have to worry about all the RSS versions or using the Atom feed. Even better is that you will be able to always follow me no matter if I move to another blog host (which is not planned) because I can simply change where FeedBurner feeds from. Third, an I really like this one, is that it enabled me to splice in my Furl posts. The new feed includes both my blog posts, stuff where I feel I have something valid to say, and my furled items, which are pages that I find interesting and want to keep and some of those might be interesting to my readers too.

What's to do for your now? Nothing, if you don't want to. But for those wanting to change, the new feed can be found at http://feeds.feedburner.com/owt . And if you don't want to use any of that stuff and just want an eMail about my blog posts once a day, then you can check out the little bloglet item on the bottom right which allows you to subscribe via eMail.
