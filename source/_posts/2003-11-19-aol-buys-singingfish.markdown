[Singingfish](http://www.singingfish.com/) is a multimedia search engine that is actually quite nice and has had some very good growth recently. Now this growth can continue with the support of a big media company, as [AOL has bought Singingfish](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2001795257_singingfish19.html).
