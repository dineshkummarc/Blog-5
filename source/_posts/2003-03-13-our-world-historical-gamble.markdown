&lt;a title=&quot;Defense - Our World-Historical Gamble&quot; href=&quot;http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/defensewrapper.jsp?PID=1051-350&amp;CID=1051-031103A&quot;&gt;TCS: Defense - Our World-Historical Gamble&lt;/a&gt; is an article by Lee Harris which some people have already told me will challenge anyone's thinking about war with Irak. I am half through and it is interesting. Sometimes I have to say that he seems to be a bit quick in his conclusions, but I simply think you might want to read this. 

On a related not, this got me thinking too. It's from somebody from the TMF boards I count as my friends: &lt;I&gt;I am not a right wing zealot but I do believe 110% that as the article states &quot;until they play by our rules, we must play by theirs&quot; in terms of how we fight this &quot;enemy&quot;.&lt;/I&gt;
