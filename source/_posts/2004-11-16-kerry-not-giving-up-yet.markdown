&lt;p&gt;It seems like Kerry is not really giving up yet. Recounts are currently going on in several states. Kerry is just not talking himself to not endager his position if the allegations are wrong. They might very well be wrong, but I am already looking forward to the media frenzy if they are not ;)&lt;/p&gt;
