To not have the world blow up in our face before we start, [we](http://ormigo.com/)'d like to solicit the help of a quality assurance specialist for a PHP Platform. This might be as a freelancer or, preferably, as a resident developer (part-time possible) who likes to go beyond simple PHPUnit implementations. You want to think ahead and find new ways to exploit what your head tells you and your fingers allow you to code. You like WebServices and know about the problems they bring, love PHP and enjoy working a team. 

The team is small and you will be able to shape the world we live in, contribute back to the open source systems you use and make sure that the core developers can happily code away with a big stick looming over their head that gives them a big NONO once they build something that doesn't connect well with the rest of the platform.

In general you are bug hunter, but your personal goal is to not have anything to hunt for when they builders go to the woods. While the builders push forward to extend our woods, you make sure that everything stays nice and tidy. As such you do not simply want to test what is there but to build a harness, a system within the system, that facilitates keeping the code performing well. At the same time you know that a certain roughness, a certain fertilization on the soil, is a good thing. Some things will fall from the trees when shook but as they will not hurt anyone for the time being. It's the trip wires you have to deal with first.

Interested? Contact me a oliver(at)ormigo.com. Looking forward to hearing from you and chatting about how we can make this work for you and build a great product together.
