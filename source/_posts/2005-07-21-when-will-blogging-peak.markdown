That's the question Jeremy [asks](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/004940.html) and I agree with him that it's potentially peaking in the not too distant future. This would be a good thing though. When on-line shopping (to take his example) was all the rage, it was still in its infancy. After the hype died down it started to really get going without the problem of hype behind it. 

I think Blogging still needs a few months to really get out of the lime light but the hype will die down in 2006, which is when it will be a standard term such as eMail and will become part of our life. More and more &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; people are starting to ask me about blogging. That's pretty peaking I feel. But people are starting to get it, beyond the hype, just the general idea of talking publicly. So 2006 the hype will die down, and by 2009 blogging will be really big.
