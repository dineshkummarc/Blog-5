This could become a good film really, with a husband going to the police to say his wife is missing... and only an Ex-FBI-Agent license and finds some strange similarities to other victims... Really well written, with some great characters laid out clearly. [Check it out!](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0451411404/)
&lt;/p&gt;
