Well now. For all those of you still wondering what happened on 9/11, check [the 9/11 timeline](http://www.unansweredquestions.org/timeline/). It's a huge timeline of what happened when, where, with whom, to whom, against what, ... huge. And it seems to be a simple list of facts, maybe collected with a bias but proved (more or less) by quoting several sources.

And while we are at it. Remember Bowling for Columbine? Well, [&quot;The truth about Bowling for Columbine&quot;](http://www.hardylaw.net/Truth_About_Bowling.html) is the rebuttel of several of the points made in the movie and some examples of what might even be called lies in their own right. In many instances it's not really lies though but creative use of source material. Still very interesting though.
