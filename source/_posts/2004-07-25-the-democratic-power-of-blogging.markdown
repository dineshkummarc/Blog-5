Lawrence Lessig has a [wonderful post](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/002046.shtml) that to me shows the power that is available within the idea of blogging with the help of RSS. Somebody with a great voice can now get the message out that somebody some TV Channel or rather TV Channel Host does is not right and he gets people thinking. Yes, the right and left wing of the political spectrum will always have a voice on the internet. Radicals always get their voice heard, and if only because they are louder than the rest. But now there will be a very easy counter-voice that anyone can have. We just need to make sure that this blogging thing will have an interconnectedness that will help readers take in the diversity that is out there.
