The new FON Router Software Version 0.6.5 has just been released and you can download it [here](http://en.fon.com/downloads/manuals-and-downloads.php). The features are the following:

&lt;em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;# FON 0.6.5 - features
	&lt;li&gt;Two-steps registration&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Local users&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;OpenWRT based&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Simple and easy to use&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Highly customizable interface&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Allows SSID changes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Internet connection protocols: static IP, DHCP, PPPoE&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Firewall and port forwarding web interface.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;WLAN (WiFi) and LAN/WAN traffic filtering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;

A few additional observations  from me. I can now finally access to network attached storage via the wireless interface. It's still not perfect because it should only allow me and authorized users through, but it is a first step. I believe there should be an option that makes the LAN open for the owner and local users. The SSID can be changed but it is then FON_whatever. Because the FON_ part is mandatory. And I had set up fon.thylmann.net... so much for that. :) I hope they change it again and only prepend FON without the _. All it all the update went easy, but you will need to know that your password after the update is root/admin and not whatever you had before. :)
