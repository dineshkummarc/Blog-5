The new FON Router Software Version 0.6.5 has just been released and you can download it [here](http://en.fon.com/downloads/manuals-and-downloads.php). The features are the following:

*
# FON 0.6.5 - features
	* Two-steps registration
	* Local users
	* OpenWRT based
	* Simple and easy to use
	* Highly customizable interface
	* Allows SSID changes
	* Internet connection protocols: static IP, DHCP, PPPoE
	* Firewall and port forwarding web interface.
	* WLAN (WiFi) and LAN/WAN traffic filtering.

*

A few additional observations  from me. I can now finally access to network attached storage via the wireless interface. It's still not perfect because it should only allow me and authorized users through, but it is a first step. I believe there should be an option that makes the LAN open for the owner and local users. The SSID can be changed but it is then FON_whatever. Because the FON_ part is mandatory. And I had set up fon.thylmann.net... so much for that. :) I hope they change it again and only prepend FON without the _. All it all the update went easy, but you will need to know that your password after the update is root/admin and not whatever you had before. :)
