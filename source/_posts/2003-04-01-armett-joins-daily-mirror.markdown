Peter Arnett, a veteran newsman, was fired by NBC yesterday after having given an interview on state-run Iraqi TV saying that the conflict was not going to plan because of fierce resistance. He was actually not telling anything new but hey, ... he got fired. Well... he's back in business. &lt;a title=&quot;Mirror.co.uk - HOME OF THE FREE: ARNETT JOINS MIRROR&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=12795796&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50143&quot;&gt;Mirror.co.uk - HOME OF THE FREE: ARNETT JOINS MIRROR&lt;/a&gt;
