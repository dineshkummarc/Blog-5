Through [charlie's post](http://cognections.typepad.com/lifeblog/2005/08/nokia_20_lives.html) I came to Darla Mack's post entiteld [Nokia 20 Lives Kicks Off on September 19](http://darlamack.blogs.com/darlamack/2005/08/nokia_20_lives_.html). The post gives a good roundup about what the game replacing the now famous yearly Nokia Game will be all about. In short, you will be stepping into the lives of 20 different people and live their lives, make their decisions. The prices will be related to the different lives the people you step into lead, like a trip to a Formula 1 weekend in Monaco. Check out the game at [www.nokia.com/20Lives/](http://www.nokia.com/20Lives/)
