The Matrix was a great movie and The Matrix Reloaded is just arround the corner. If you can get your hands on the latest WIRED then I highly suggest getting it because it includes a great article about the making of The Martix. The second one now includes a fully computer animated fight scene in which they put the faces of Neo and Agent Smith back on the computer animated figures because this is the part of the human body that people notice to be fake the fastests. With the help of this technology, they can now fly the camera arround the scene at will, finding the best angles.
