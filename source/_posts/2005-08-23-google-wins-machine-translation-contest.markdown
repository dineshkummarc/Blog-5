Ok, it was more of an evaluation, but still. At this years [National Institute of Standards and Technology Machine Translation Evaluation](http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/mt05eval_official_results_release_20050801_v3.html) Google kind of won. In all the test, like Arabic-to-English Task (Large Data Track) Google put in the highest points against others like the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, IBM and RWTH-Aachen (where I studied physics :)). Congrats people of Google. :) (Source: &lt;a title=&quot;The machines do the translating&quot; href=&quot;http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/08/machines-do-translating.html&quot;&gt;Google Blog: The machines do the translating)
