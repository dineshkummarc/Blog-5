God that feels good. I just finished my first Tutor Marked Assignement (TMA) for my current MBA studies. Just to tell everybody a bit more about me, I am doing part time studies for an MBA at the Open University in England, which is a university that is targetted at people that are working and lets you work from home/work. Up till not, I started this month, it is a lot of fun and very insightful.

I mean I am running/started two companies and have some many ideas at 25 that I just know I need some basic theory to really be good at what I do. LOL :)

Well it is a wonderful day. If only I would not have so many things to do then I would be working on my personal home page again. Damn.

Ah well. The time will come.
