Ok, this is very cool.[&lt;img width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;133&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;04_mobiletv_1&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.thylmann.net/images/04_mobiletv_1.jpg&quot; /&gt;](http://owt.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/04_mobiletv_1.jpg) 

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://press.nokia.com/PR/200502/979351_5.html&quot;&gt;The Nokia 7710 also takes weblogging mobile. The moblog client allows people to instantly publish their life experiences on the web in a simple environment. You can post pictures and text from your Nokia 7710 directly to the web and share your thoughts and memories with family and friends or anyone on the web.&amp;nbsp; 



The cool thing is that the 7710 has pen input and you can write over the images :) And it does seem to be 
[shipping](http://press.nokia.com/PR/200502/979351_5.html). Maybe Nokia will bring it to the [meeting today](http://www.socialtext.net/loicwiki/index.cgi?berlin_europablog). Please remember that I did review phones for [InfoSync World](http://www.infosyncworld.com) once and would gladly keep it ;)
