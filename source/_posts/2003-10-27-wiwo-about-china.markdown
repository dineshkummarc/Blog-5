The german magazine [WirschaftsWoche](http://www.wiwo.de/) has a special edition out now about China... well kind of. If you take the magazine normally you have a magazine about China in German. If you turn it arround, you get a chinese one about Germany! Very well done. Check out the chinese part [here](http://www.wiwo.de/pswiwo/fn/ww2/sfn/buildww/id/645/exturl/687474703a2f2f7777772e7769776f2e64652f7769776f726c7a722f737461746963732f63685f6672616d657365742e68746d6c/fb/0/fm/1/fl/1/bt/2/SH/0/depot/0/index.html).
