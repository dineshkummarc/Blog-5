How could you save Microsoft 329000 EURs per year? [Jeffrey Zeldman links to an article about saving Microsoft 329 terabytes of data transfer on their web site through a move to CSS layout](http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0704e.shtml) away from tables and 1x1 position pixels. Now of course the monetary number is a guess and it is likely lower because I doubt that MS pays 1EUR per GB of data transferred, but it just shows that we are talking about relatively high numbers, not that they would make a dent in Microsofts pockets, which is probably why they simply won't change the homepage design as the hassle would cost for more than that. :)
