Nice to see that [OpenBC](http://www.openbc.com/) has a blog called &lt;a title=&quot;openBLOG - The company weblog of openBC&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.openbc.com/&quot;&gt;openBLOG. The nice thing is that reading over it for the first time it seems to be written in a rather natural voice and I hope they continue down that path. Congratulations for a successful business, looking forward to reading more about it.
