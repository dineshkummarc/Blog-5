Yahoo! now has the [Yahoo! Research Lab](http://labs.yahoo.com/) similar to the [Google Labs](http://labs.google.com/). While this is nothing too special, it made me realise that they, or rather Overture, are [supporting](http://research.overture.com/demo/nutch/) [Nutch](http://www.nutch.org/), an open source search engine. And that little engine seems to be evolving well I have to say. A demo can be found [here](http://research.overture.com/demo/nutch/).
