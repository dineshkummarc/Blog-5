Great post by John Battelle about unconfirmed rumors that Google will offer something similar to eBay's PayPal. Check it out: [Google to Offer Payment Service](http://battellemedia.com/archives/001638.php)

The first reaction would be &quot;hÃ¤? what does that have to do with search?&quot;... but then you notice, they are not about search. Never have been. Their mission &quot;*is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful*&quot;. And boy is my buying habits a big part of that. It might be a bit scary though knowing that Google is known to not really share what they do with all the information. They already know what I search for, where I go on the Net (at least where they have AdSense), how long I stay there (AdSense), what I am most interested in (click throughs on ads and organic results), and soon maybe what I buy or sell.
