A big part of the entire finance course is choosing which projects to do and which not to do. A lot of why they should be done banks on the idea of ROI (Return on Investment) as measured by NPV (Net present value) or other means. Frank Scavo, The Enterprise System Spectator, has a very good post entitled [Escaping the ROI Trap](http://fscavo.blogspot.com/2003_12_01_fscavo_archive.html#107255959096298847) about how a pitch for a project should be undertaken. This one fits very well with the course, adding another small but valid dimension to it all.
