[Erwin](http://www.transpontine.com/) linked to [an article](http://www.receiver.vodafone.com/08/articles/index07.html) by Mizuko Ito about mobile phone use in Japan among teens. It's a nice and easy read and with Japanese seeming to be a few steps in front of us in terms of mobility, some things in there could be taken as a trend for us. Where I agree with the article, and Erwin, already, is that with social meetings, or even meetings in general, being late is no longer such a problem (it's still nice to be on time though :)) as long as you call and say that you will be late and by how many minutes.
