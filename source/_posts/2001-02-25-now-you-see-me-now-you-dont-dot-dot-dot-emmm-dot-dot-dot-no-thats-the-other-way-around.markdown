I have a new image up which is actually a clipping from my picture on [inside.benews.com](http://inside.benews.com) and rather old. But [Scot](http://shacker.livejournal.com) convinced me that it would be a good idea if you _can_ see my face in the picture.

I need a new digital camera by the way. These things are addictive. A friend of mine has a Casio (yes they do not only make watches :)) which lets you use an IBM Microdrive. That rules. And they have a new one which is about the size of the Canon Ixus and also has place for the Microdrive. 1 Gig of high resolution images to carry around :) Wow! :) Drool.

I would like to thank the amazing [Dr Z](http://www.livejournal.com/users/ziemkowski) (sorry, that nick is too cool and fitting :)) for welcoming me to the collective in his latest post.

And everybody bow before the might [Sean](http://www.livejournal.com/users/grahams/) who is now no longer studying :)

And while we are at it and are spreading knowledge, I suggest you all head on over to Cal Evans site and read his [Nerd Herding](http://www.calevans.com/articles/nerdHerding.html) which is a very fun and insightful thing to read. At least from my perspective.

I have some others on my palm that I might share with you at a later date.
