Ross Mayfield write gives some interesting quotes and links in relation to his thinking about Knowledge Management &lt;a title=&quot;Ross Mayfield's Weblog: Doing Management&quot; href=&quot;http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2003/10/doing_managemen.html&quot;&gt;here. Of course he is CEO of [Socialtext](http://www.socialtext.com/) and thus has a legitimate interest in saying what he does, but it still brings across an interesting point. Can you manage knowledge as such, top-down, enforcing it. Or would it be better to let all the pressure go and just enable it to be shared. In the second part you have the potential of loosing lots of knowledge as you are not forcing, but the question is if you will not be able to capture so much more as you let the minds run free.
