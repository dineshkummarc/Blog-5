With Yahoo! Video Search turning 1.0, one of the interesting searches is for [hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy](http://video.search.yahoo.com/search/video?ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=sfp&amp;p=hitchhiker%27s guide to the galaxy), which will turn up lots of links to trailors and other things in relation to the movie. Very cool indeed.
