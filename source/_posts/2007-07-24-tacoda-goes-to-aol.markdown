What do we hear there? TechCrunch alerted me that [AOL seems to have bought Tacoda](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/24/aol-gets-its-ad-network-too/). The [New York Post is talking about it too](http://www.nypost.com/seven/07242007/business/aol_has_an_eye_on_you_business_peter_lauria.htm), citing prices between $200 and $300 million. the NYP article was actually linked right from the [Tacoda Homepage.](http://tacoda.com/) :) We had some turmoil some weeks ago in the [ad server market](http://blog.thylmann.net/2007/05/19/more-thoughts-on-microsoft-and-the-banner-market/) and AOL only got the small player in AdTech (not the conference, the ad server ;)) And now it seems like they got themselves an ad network. Actually it really goes into the behavioral targeting world, about whichÂ  Jeremy Liew has [some good thoughts](http://venturebeat.com/2007/07/24/ad-networks-why-it%e2%80%99s-better-than-ever-to-be-a-targeted-content-site/).

The thing is though that this might hot up the behavioral ad market too.Â  It is important to note though that Tacoda also is a network, even though I am not sure how the network is booked, e.g. do they get the rests from publishers because they can monetize them better (Update: [seems like it](http://tacoda.com/publishers/).), do they pay fixed up front and hope to make a margin, or are they first choice and simply really pay more. AdWeek has a [good article on behavioral ads](http://www.adweek.com/aw/iq_interactive/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001351362), in that they might even click worse, but have higher conversions afterwards.

The thing is that AOL already has advertising.com, and they are a network of sorts, and I don't know what Tacoda ads to the equation. The thing is that some big publishers might cancel their relations with Tacoda due to a possibly buy from AOL. We really need an independant player in that market.Â  [wunderloop](http://wunderloop.com) might be one (Disclosure: Michael Kleindl is Chairman of wunderloop and Investor in [Ormigo](http://ormigo.com/)) or [nugg.ad](http://nugg.ad).

One thing is important though. Whoever gets to see people on niche sites, gets to target them on the big non-focused sites. So I might agree with Jeremy that that is the really important part for the behavioral market guys. Happy to learn more.
