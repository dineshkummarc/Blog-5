Ok, so I am playing Nokia Game (http://www.nokiagame.com). It just started, I already got called, received several sms and have a few e-mails. I know where to start. Now I find out that you need I.E. 4.5+ but IE6 is not supported. Stupid. Stupid! STUPIIIIID! Now I need to find out how I can install several IE versions next to each other. I have 6 already ... downgrading windows. Interesting.
