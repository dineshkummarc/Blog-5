I was just sent a story on [the wonder of india](http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,275665,00.html). It's about a man in India, who says he hasn't eaten in 65 years. He is now under close observation, constant surveilance with cameras, in a hospital and he hasn't eaten or drank in 10 days. He also hasn't been to the toilet in that time. 

He says that this is going on since he is 8 when he started having some kind of outflow from his palate (?). The doctors have not been able to analyze it yet :)

I am still not sure if we somehow have April or something again and I just missed it. :)
