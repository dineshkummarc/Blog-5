Christian Lindholm [posted](http://www.christianlindholm.com/christianlindholm/2006/04/say_hello_to_th_1.html) about the [Nokia N93](http://www.nokia.com/nseries/index.html?loc=inside,main_n93). I would agree with Christian that you can't call it a phone. It's a device that does lots of things. First of all it has a good lense, with 3.2 mega pixels, 3x optical zoom and 640x480 30fps video capability. That alone is amazingly cool. It also has WiFi next to 3G, 50MB of internal storage S60 3.0 and costs less than the Nokia N90. Now how cool is that! Congratulations Nokia.
