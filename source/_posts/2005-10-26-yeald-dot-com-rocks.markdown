There are lots of newspapers out there but one company really got what good design, a good methodolgy and a community spirit means. That company, or rather that news site, is &lt;a title=&quot;YEALD.com The Challenging Investor Journal&quot; href=&quot;http://www.yeald.com/Yeald/index.html&quot;&gt;YEALD.com The Challenging Investor Journal&lt;/a&gt;. So what is Yeald? You can check the [FAQ](http://www.yeald.com/Yeald/faq.html) to see that everyone can write. Everyone can rate. Everyone can contribute, share and give his opinion, lots of AJAX action included. They actually have another company that is part of this Yeald system that I really like and will talk about another time. Looks like a really great company. It revolves around the fact that all equity management is biased as long as there are fees to be made that are not aligned to an increase of the clients money. Looking forward to playing with the site some more.
