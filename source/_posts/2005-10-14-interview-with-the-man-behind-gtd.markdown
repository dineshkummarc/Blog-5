The Guardian has a [very nice interview with David Allen](http://technology.guardian.co.uk/businesssense/story/0,16568,1580180,00.html), the guy behind GTD. GTD stands for &lt;I&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/I&gt; and I [posted](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/10/kinkless_gtd.html) about it recently in terms of starting to use [Kinless GTD](http://kinkless.com/articles/category/kgtd/). The interview is a good introduction to GTD actually.
