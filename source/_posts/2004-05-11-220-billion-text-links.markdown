In a previous post I looked at the [revenue coming in for Google via AdSense](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/05/google_xls_and_.html).  As of that post $341 Million come in via AdSense. This is for 3 months, so let's devide that by 3, leading to arround $111 Million, just to have a nice number. How much does Google make as CPM on those ads?

&lt;pre&gt;
CPM            Total Revenue             Ads Delivered
$1               $111,000,000              111,000,000,000
$2               $111,000,000              55,500,000,000
$3               $111,000,000              37,000,000,000
&lt;/pre&gt;

Let's just presume $2, then that over 55 Billion Ads delivered. With 4 Text Links Average on those Banners that's 220 Billion Text Links delivered. In one month. That's what I call reach. It might just be half that if they really make $4 CPM or more on their entire network, but still, these are huge numbers.
