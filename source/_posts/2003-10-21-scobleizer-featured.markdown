Lots of blogging stuff today. Scobleizer has been [featured by Baseline](http://www.baselinemag.com/article2/0,3959,1357817,00.asp). 

*The most powerful piece of software inside Microsoft may be the $40 application from a tiny vendor called Userland that Robert Scoble uses to write his weblog. *

Good article and [Scoble feels the traffic](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/10/20.html#a5138) ;)

I agree with the article in many respects: *There are some barriers to adoption. Using weblogs means trusting your employees to speak honestly and openly. It means conversing with customers, not just marketing to them. It means even more flattening of your organization. *
