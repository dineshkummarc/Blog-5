It starts to look interesting. Tim Bonnemann recently contacted me and some other people about a potential Web 2.0 meetup in Cologne and it has been gaining interest. The meeting will take place on the 7th of November, so next Monday and there are already 25 people on the list, confirmed to be coming. The current most likely location is the Hallmackenreuther here in Cologne, which has [free Wifi](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/05/hallmackenreuth.html) but as the group is already bigger than what could be seated in the upper part of the location, other venues are being looked at. The wiki for the event is up at &lt;a title=&quot;start [Web Montag]&quot; href=&quot;http://www.plansphere.com/webmontag/doku.php&quot;&gt;start [Web Montag].

The list of participants include people like [Tim](http://www.plansphere.com/), [Nico](http://www.lumma.de/) from blogg.de (among others), [Philipp](http://blog.outer-court.com/) from blog.outer-court.com, [Oliver Wrede](http://wrede.interfacedesign.org/) (Professor in Cologne), [Mario](http://www.sixtus.net/), Thomas from [Podcastschau.de](http://podcastschau.de/), Stefan Kellner ([Plazes](http://plazes.de/) among others), and a lot more... The event is going in the right direction.
