News.com has a report that an update to Office v.X is coming and among others...

&lt;I&gt;Although the spring update won't tackle that problem, the free download will offer more than 1,000 bug fixes and other tweaks as well as a couple of new features such as improved text rendering. Around the same time, Microsoft also plans to release software that will allow Office to synch directly to a Palm handheld and a new version of its MSN Messenger instant messaging program.&lt;/I&gt;

That's good to know.
