It's simply raining. It's just bad weather. And we are sitting at the coast. Damn! It's just no fun.

Well that's not quite true. We are having a lot of fun up till now it's just that it does not involve the sun :) Interestingly enough though, the place above us is full of children and the bad weather results in these children now running back and forth without interruption. :)

We can still hope that the weather will get better.
