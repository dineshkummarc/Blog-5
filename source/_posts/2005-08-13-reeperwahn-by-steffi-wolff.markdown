I was rather skeptical by this pink book but I have to admit that I laughed my head of from time to time. It's a bit surreal with the main character having an alligator that is short sighted and an epileptic. Some might feel it is a bit over the top, others will like the language and simply enjoy a group of females, who write for a porn mag, kill a few people. Light reading but fun. [Check it out!](http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3596165881/)
