Techcrunch is [reporting](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/02/16/google-to-start-reporting-subscriber-numbers/) that Google is now giving out subscriber numbers to their feed services. So people subscribed to your feed via Google Services are not showing up in [FeedBurner](http://feedburner.com). I for one, just added 46 new subscribers. Well not really, but now I know about them. :)
