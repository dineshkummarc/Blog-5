It seems that the $75 million VC round wasn't enough for Fastclick and now they are [set to go public](http://www.marketingvox.com/archives/2004/12/23/fastclick_to_go_ipo_doubleclick_bid_not_ruled_out/index.php?rss1) for another $92 million. The bigger idea here is the resulting market cap for stock based acquisitions I presume with large parts of the money going into cash flow management especially if the acquire large publishers to run their ads. This is just a small push into the performance marketing place that I talked about earlier. As the article notes, it's very sad for DoubleClick that they shed exactly that business some time ago and I am looking forward to seeing what happens to [Tribal Fusion](http://www.tribalfusion.com) in all this move back to networks.
