The rest is easily told. We arrived in Hurghada on monday to meet my parents and my brother and his gilfriend. Just the right temperature, nice reading, a bit of red sea water a bit of pool water, more reading, more sun, bits of huge ants on the feet, wonderful prawns/shrimp/scampi, weird fetucini with curry and some very strange spice, a few good cocktails ... it goes on and on like this until yesterday :) Sunday night we left the hotel at 11:30 to arrive in Cologne around 15:00 having taken a total of 2 taxis, 2 busses, one train and 3 airplanes. The good thing was though that on our trip from Cairo to Frankfurt we were upgraded to Business Class which was just wonderful. That's where my holiday ends. Ah well. It was wonderful while it lasted and we have wonderful weather in cologne now too :)
