Interesting presentation by Marshall Brain entitled &lt;a title=&quot; How to Make a Million Dollars, by Marshall Brain&quot; href=&quot;http://marshallbrain.com/million.htm&quot;&gt;How to Make a Million Dollars. He founded [How Stuff Works](http://www.howstuffworks.com/), so should at least have a good idea. :)

Some interesting points in there. For example Woody Allen's quote: *Eighty percent of success is showing up.*, which is really true. You just need to take the step. Also Winston Churchill's quote is good: *Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm*. Make your goals clear to yourself, attach them somewhere visible and go. Then watch out for luck, which can of course only happen if you are walking. Practice practice practice. Find something of value to people, provide that and make sure it's a big industry.
