German has often been said to not have a real service culture and sometimes this might even be correct from time to time. The biggest problem to a starting german service culture is TV though. Here, we have this wonderful idea that we should test out how customer friendly german companies really are. Will they take back worn underwear? Will they take back meet that has been cooked for 20 minutes? This is nuts! They will obviously do it because they think it is right. The TV station probably tries to find somebody that does it until they do, and then they tell them they did wrong, based on the knowledge of some &quot;consultant.&quot; 

This solves nothing though. It's not like they get a free course on how to be customer friendly and where good service ends. They still have to do it or their potential customers will move elsewhere, or so they believe.  Now, thanks to those TV shows, lots of people will run arround try to exploit that and soon the entire service culture will be dead again. Wonderful. Totally stupid.
