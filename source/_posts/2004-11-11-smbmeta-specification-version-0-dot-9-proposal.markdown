Ok, this iss cool. I am finding too much cool stuff today. Here are the&amp;nbsp; &lt;a title=&quot;SMBmeta Specification Version 0.9 Proposal&quot; href=&quot;http://www.trellixtech.com/smbmetaspec09proposal.html&quot;&gt;SMBmeta Specification Version 0.9 Proposal specs. This is an XML file format that could be put in the root directory of your site if you have a pizzaria or something and would allow search engines to find a pizzaria in your neighborhood, that has still open, has what you want, blah blah blah. Very nice. Of course this is only a small part of the semantic web idea that is growing but it shows where this might lead. The [source](http://wasserfuhr.com/nodes/node.jsp?session=3u9EbQzuUmySTdp&amp;id=1151) has some further info on this.
