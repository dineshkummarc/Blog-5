With search being so important, some are afraid that the big companies get too much power into their hands with their search engines. In essence they could control what a surfer sees, which can get a little scary. So some people started [Nutch](http://www.nutch.org/docs/index.html), which is supposed to become an open source search engine. I wonder if it will work, partly because of the high costs associated with a popular search engine (thousands of servers, huge amounts of bandwidth, ...) and party because I am still not convinced that open source really works. Yes it worked in some systems but that doesn't mean it will work in others.
