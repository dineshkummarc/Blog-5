Since taking up the exclusive licensing of TypePad in some parts of this world, the fruits are starting to show. Loic just posted on the [Launch of TypePad France](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2004/04/typepad_france_.html) and others, including Germany, seem to be following closely. Congratulations Loic!
