I found the [Kinkless GTD System](http://kinkless.com/articles/category/kgtd/) via [this post](http://www.43folders.com/2005/10/04/review-kinkless-gtd-for-automated-elegant-os-x-task-management/) on 43 Folders and it does kick major ass. I was trying to find something similar for a long time, something that allows me to manage my tasks in an easy way and giving me a good overview about what happens next and what is waiting, keeping your head clear. If you have OmniOutliner Pro, try it out, otherwise download a trial or just buy the damn thing. :)
