I actually didn't know if I should have put this under the business category. But Rockstar Games have updated their &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; popular game Grand Theft Auto. It's one, if not the, best seller on the PS2 and other consoles and they now have Grand Theft Auto Vice City as an update. What they seem to be doing is simply taking the &quot;old&quot; game and making it a teaser for the big one. Congratulations!
