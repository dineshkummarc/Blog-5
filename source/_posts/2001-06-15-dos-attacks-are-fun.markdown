We had a relatively short DoS attack on our servers yesterday. Something like 30 minutes to one hour. Actually it was an entire class C subnet that was hit and our servers just happen to be in there. We have no idea if our servers were attack explicitely. Grrrr... These things really suck. I mean you are sitting there and there is close to nothing you can do. An entire Cisco Switch/Router broke down it seems.

Ah well. It's over now and there is no realy damage. Our servers were not hit too hard and seems like the counters still worked more or less reliably even, partly to my amazement. :)
