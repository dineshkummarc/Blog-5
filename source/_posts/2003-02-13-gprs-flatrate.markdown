Now if this isn't cool! &lt;a title=&quot;Orange UK launches flat-rate GPRS&quot; href=&quot;http://www.infosync.no/news/2002/n/3063.html&quot;&gt;infoSync : Orange UK launches flat-rate GPRS

Sure, it costs 45 pounds per month for full internet access but honestly, for always online, whereever you go, whereever you are, ... great. I love it. I want it in germany!
