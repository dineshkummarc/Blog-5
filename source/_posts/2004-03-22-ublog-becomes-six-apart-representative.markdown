We are moving into the corporate world with blogging people. This is no longer childs play. The bets are on. [The big deal](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2004/03/low_blogging_cu.html) is out. Loic le Meur, founder of [Ublog](http://www.u-blog.net/site/) has moved his personal blog to [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com). For those who were paying attention, this was getting clearer by the day with Loic having his [loiclemeur.com](http://www.loiclemeur.com/) domain on TypePad, used for his photos for some time now.

Congratulations both to Loic/UBlog and Six Apart! You can read all about it [right here on Loic's new blog](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2004/03/six_apart_and_u.html). Update your RSS feeds.
