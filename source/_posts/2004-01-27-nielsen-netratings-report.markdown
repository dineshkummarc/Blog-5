[Nielsen Netratings](http://www.nielsen-netratings.com/) has published a Report in Germany, saying that 94% of internet connected households do not take important decisions without usage of the Internet first. The most important starting point for 79% of them are search engines followed at 55% by the web sites of brands and producers. 46% are certain that they buying time is shortened by using the Internet. 

All of this should really make people see how important the internet is for advertising. You might not be buying online, but you will surely get informed online.
