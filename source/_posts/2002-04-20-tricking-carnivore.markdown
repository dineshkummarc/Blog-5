There has been a lot of outcry about Carnivore, the FBI system used to tab internet traffic. Now a student has presented his idea of an armored data vault at a privacy enhancing technologies workshop. The idea is as follows. A computer in a network is setup to log all traffic on that network and store it, encrypted, with the only key able to unlock the information kept by the vault. If the FBI wants the information they submit a digitally signed court order which the vault recognized and gives out the information in that order and only that information. The processor involved is an IBM 4758 cryptographic coprocessor, designed to destroy itself if it detects an intrusion attempt. Now how cool is that?
