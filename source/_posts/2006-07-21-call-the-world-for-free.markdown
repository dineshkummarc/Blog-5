The [Gizmo Project](http://www.gizmoproject.com/) makes me think to get the [Nokia 770](http://www.nokia.com/770) a third time (screen problems with both two devices I bought). Gizmo is something like skype but for one, it is available on the Nokia 770. You do start to wonder why Skype is so slow with releasing new versions.

But Gizmo just went out with an amazing new feature, though a bit easy to mistake for even better. Starting now you can call landlines and mobile phones (some countries) for free with Gizmo. The only requirement is that a user registers with Gizmo and enters their phone numbers in their profile. Once there, you can call that number free via Gizmo. Looking forward to see some more people sign up.
