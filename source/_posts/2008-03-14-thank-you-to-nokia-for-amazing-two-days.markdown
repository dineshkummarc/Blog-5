Back at home after a great day back at work, I am starting to reflect about Wednesday and Thursday at the [Nokia Idea Generation Workshop](http://blog.thylmann.net/2008/03/11/nokia-idea-generation-workshop/). What an amazing two days. Nokia made sure that all our needs were cared for, to be able to fully concentrate on the work shop. The [St. Martin's Lane](http://www.stmartinslane.com/) Hotel was amazing and a challenge to the senses, and this was followed by a very good dinner in the beautiful setting of the Sketch Restaurant. With some great wine, and Mojitos later at the St. Martin Lane's bar, the evening was full of great conversations on and off-topic.

The thing is that the crowd was wonderful and everybody wanted to stay in contact afterwards. We were fortunate to have some amazing people from Nokia but also from very diverse fields in the location that helped having a free spirit and open discussions: [14 Henrietta Street](http://www.14henrietta.com/).

Sadly there is not a lot more I can rave about as I can't talk about the content, even though it wouldn't be too interesting for all of you out there if you weren't part of the talks to get there. Thanks go especially to [Scott Hirsh](http://www.managementinnovationgroup.com/principals/scott-hirsch/) who was a great facilitator, always being in the background and nudging us back on track if the excitement of one special subject got the better of us ;)

I do not want to single out any one person from the gang that was there, so I will leave it at that, other that I have to post about my new Nokia N810 soon, thanks, which is an amazing step forward from the Nokia N770 that I already have. I am really seeing myself using it, already have stuff like a last.fm clients, media system, ssh, skype, and others installed. But more on that in another post.

Thanks for challenging discussions, great insight, and listening to the world around you! Looking forward to the next meeting.
