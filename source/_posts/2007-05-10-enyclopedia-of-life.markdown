[Encyclopedia of Life](http://www.eol.org/home.html) is &lt;em&gt;an ecosystem of websites that makes all key information about life on Earth accessible to anyone, anywhere in the world.Â &lt;/em&gt;

And they do have a very cool video presentation on their site about what they are about to do. Wonderfully done, very well explained.
