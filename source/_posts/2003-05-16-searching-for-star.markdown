I am currently playing with Overture and Google AdWords and bit and it's very interesting I have to say. If you go to the [tools section at Overture](http://www.content.overture.com/d/USm/adcenter/tools/index.jhtml) and go to the Term Suggestion Tool you can enter for example &quot;*&quot; to see how many search for that term. Interestingly enough...

&lt;img alt=&quot;overture-search.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/overture-search.jpg&quot; width=&quot;307&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;

What are people thinking???? &quot;I'd like to find the everything please.&quot; ... then again ... I searched for it too ;)
