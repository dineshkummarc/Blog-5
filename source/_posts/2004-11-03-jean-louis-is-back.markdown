Ok this kicks! I just read [here](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/52849) that Be Inc. founder Jean-Louis GassÃ©e has become Chairman of the Board of [PalmSource](http://www.palmsource.com/)! You can check the press release [here](http://www.palmsource.com/press/2004/110104_board.html). I love it! I was one of the first people at BeNews, the then leading news site about BeOS, and held up until we called it quits when Palm bought Be Inc.'s assets. Congratulations to Jean-Louis and congrats to PalmSource. Now I want the new OS even more :) Ok. He's not CEO but &quot;only&quot; Chairman of the Board, but still. This is a good sign.
