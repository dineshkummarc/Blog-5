I made it to bed at 4:30 am yesterday, somewhat later then I planned but I am back up and happy to tell the world that I still think the idea of doing a journal is good :)

Now shortly to the BizKiffer nickname. That actually is one of the first nicknames that really fits I think. It came directly from friends after they noticed me reading so many business books and magazines. So Biz stands for Business. Smoking hemp/pott.. is called Kiffen in germany, so a Kiffer is somebody who does that. Together with Biz it should just show that I really enjoy reading business books and people see that when I am :)

There you have it.

Other than that I have a very good morning and actually was not waken by the loud noise of people singing. I am living on the main square in Aachen/Germany and we have Karneval now, which is the time of year where people are &quot;allowed&quot; to go crazy. Think of it as Halloween without the scary part and with A LOT of alcohol. Because I live on the main square, all big happenings take place directly in front of my window. Thursday that was bad when at 8:30am you had people testing a PA system for the first meeting of the Aachener Karnevals Verein. And tomorrow, monday, it will be bad, mainly because we have a big parade through Aachen and it will go past my window. It will also be a lot of fun as you might have realized by now. The entire square will be drunk by mid day :)

Anyway. I have a lot to do today in terms of writing some articles and get the basics for a contract done. Have a good day.
