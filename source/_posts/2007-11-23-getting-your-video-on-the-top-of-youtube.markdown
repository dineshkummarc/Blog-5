It's not all art, there is a lot of science to it, or so it seems. Check out this very well commented post on Techcrunch called [The Secret Strategies Behind Many Viral Videos](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/22/the-secret-strategies-behind-many-viral-videos/). So you think all of the top videos are there by accident? If you take a look at the [most viewed videos all time](http://youtube.com/browse?s=mp&amp;t=a&amp;c=0&amp;l=) there are a lot of brand videos on there for my taste. This made me wonder a few days ago how this happens and the article seems to be a good pointer.

In general, it's simple. You spam, a quasi legal way. You have several youtube accounts and comment around, you post on forums, pay bloggers to post a video, use 5000-friends-accounts on facebook to distribute the video, ... stuff like that. If the video then has a few qualities that the post talks about, you might have yourself a viral video. Congratulations :)
