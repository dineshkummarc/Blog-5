With 70 people sure to come and another 27 on the Maybe List, today's [Web Montag in KÃ¶ln](http://www.webmontag.de/doku.php?id=koeln) is sure to be a big one. The basement at Hallmackenreuther has already been secured and I am looking forward to meeting you all there. As already said, [Ormigo](http://ormigo.com/) is looking for [developers](http://blog.thylmann.net/2006/03/ormigo_looking_.html) (interns welcome) and actually if you are interested no matter what you do, but think you can help us succeed, let's have a chat. I have a thylmann.net shirt at the event, so I will be easy to spot, no matter if we have name tags or not ;)
