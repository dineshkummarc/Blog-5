Slashdot [pointed me](http://slashdot.org/articles/05/09/29/000223.shtml?tid=126) to [a post on ZDnet](http://blogs.zdnet.com/web2explorer/index.php?p=20) about available offlice like apps for the web. There is some really nice stuff in there. [FCKEditor](http://fckeditor.net/) is a seemingly very nice editor, but there are a lot of those out there. [Writely](http://www.writely.com/) seems to be very nice indeed though. [Kiko](http://www.kiko.com/) allows you to do a spreadsheet online and [S5](http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/) is a framework for building presentations online via CSS. Nice stuff indeed.
