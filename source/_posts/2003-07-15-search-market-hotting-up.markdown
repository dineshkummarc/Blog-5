The search market is really hotting up now. Overture bought Altavista and Fast Search &amp; Transfer. Yahoo bought Inktomi. Now Yahoo bought Overture. Shortly before, FindWhat merged with eSpotting and roughly a month or two ago, the web was starting to light up with MSNBot, a new search bot by MSN, which brought the rumors rising that MSN is going into search on their own. Still, in [this article](http://news.com.com/2100-1024-1025725.html?tag=nl), Danny Sullivan from SearchEngineWatch.com argues that what better way there is for MSN to get even than buying Google. At the same time, Google is possibly trying to go public which would make the price so high, that it starts to become unreasonable for MSN to buy them. Watch out for the search engines. :)
