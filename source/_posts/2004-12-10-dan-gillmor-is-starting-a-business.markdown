First SiliconBeat [wrote about it](http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2004/12/09/dan_gillmor_leaving_merc.html) and now Dan [posted it](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/) to his own journal. He is leaving The Mercury News and is starting his own business around the ideas in [We the Media](http://wethemedia.oreilly.com/).  A quote from Dan out of the SiliconBeat Story follows: 

*Something powerful is happening, it's in the early stages and I have a chance to help figure this out.

A friend who knows about this asked the question I'm sure some others will ask: &quot;Are you nuts?&quot; I hope not. Of course, I AM leaving one of the best gigs in journalism. The Merc has been incredibly good to me. There are so many talented and good-hearted folks here.

I hate the idea of leaving. But I'd hate not trying this even more.*

Very good sentence and I do with him the best of luck. Something powerful is happening indeed.
