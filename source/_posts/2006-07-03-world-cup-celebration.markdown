I am finally getting to uploading the videos that I took from the celebrations of Germany's victory in the last football match. They are taken in the [ZÃ¼lpicher Str. in Cologne](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Z%C3%BClpicher+Str,+K%C3%B6ln,+Germany&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=50.930336,6.939191&amp;spn=0.001748,0.006561&amp;t=h&amp;om=1).

It's a playlist of four videos. The second is of the german national anthem, which is stunning to see sung in the streets. We are getting a healthy dose of patriotism due to these football games, which I am happy to see.

P.S.: Fotos will follow later. Currently installing a new pc.
