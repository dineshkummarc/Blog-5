Yesterday I told people about [Channel9](http://channel9.msdn.com/) and how people at Microsoft really like being there and it's not all about being evil. Channel9 got its name from American Airlines, where Channel 9 allows you to listen in on the cockpit radio communication. So Microsoft's Channel 9 is really about letting people (mostly developers) to take a look into Microsoft and hence, open up the company to get a more personal vibe to it. It's actually a great place to work or so it seems. Now the one and only Robert Scoble managed to get [a Quick chat with Microsoft's CEO](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=85532) Steve Ballmer for Channel9. And boy is this a nice one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check this quote about why he allowed blogging to happen at Microsoft: &lt;I&gt;[...] We trust our people to represent our company. Thatâ€™s what they are paid to do. If they donâ€™t want to be here they wouldnâ€™t be here. So in a sense you donâ€™t run any more risk letting someone express themselves on a blog than you do letting them go out and see a customer on their own anyway. It just touches more people. Hey, if people need to be trained or understand better we can do that but I find that itâ€™s just a great way to have customer communications.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great energetic guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Update&lt;/B&gt;: Forgot that one. Why are developers so important? &lt;I&gt;At the end of the day the innovation in the software business and the IT business comes because someone writes a great piece of code. Even in the hardware frankly most of the innovation comes because someone writes a great piece of code. An important piece of code. A great piece of code.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
