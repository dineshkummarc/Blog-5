There we have it, Samsung [said](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/68/34262.html) that they will overtake Nokia as the biggest supplier of mobile phones by 2010. A very high goal, then again, some companies that set themselves these goals really make them. Just read [Good to Great](http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000313.php) to get an idea about these big goals companies. I should be worried about my Nokia shares now, but up till now I am not. This needs to be watched though. On a related not, Russel Beattie caught something at the [Nokia Capital Markets Day](http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/001025.php) that I missed: [Nokia gets moblogging](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1005176.html). How cool is that!
