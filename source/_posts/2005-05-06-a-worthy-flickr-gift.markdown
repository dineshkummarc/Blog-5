I signed up to [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) early on and recently got a one year extension on my pro account and two pro accounts to give away as a gift. I just gave the second one to a dear friend and boy was it worth it.  Check out [Chriggy's Photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/24092454@N00/)! There are some real jewels in there. I mean the [Villers la Ville](http://www.flickr.com/photos/24092454@N00/12591785/in/photostream/) or [star](http://www.flickr.com/photos/24092454@N00/12591117/in/photostream/) or [leaf stripes](http://www.flickr.com/photos/24092454@N00/12590490/in/photostream/) or [female statue](http://www.flickr.com/photos/24092454@N00/12588517/in/photostream/) or ... I could go on, but check it out for yourself. Thanks for sharing Chriggy. :)
