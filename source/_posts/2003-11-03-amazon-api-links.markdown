A few interesting uses of the Amazon API, mostly taken [from this page](http://erikbenson.com/index.cgi?node=Amazon%20API). 

[Simplest Shop](http://simplest-shop.com/) is simply another interface to Amazon. This just shows how far this can go and Amazon actually shouldn't really care. [Add Associate](http://addassociate.com/) is actually still in Beta but might become something like content targetted Amazon Shopping Links. Nice. [PM Browser](http://www.pmbrowser.info/amazon.html) is a nice way to browse books a bit differently. As is [Amzn-vista](http://www.langreiter.com/space/amzn-vista) which uses the &quot;People also read&quot; feature from Amazon to give you some suggestions in a nice way.

I think I'll have to look into the [PHP capabilities](http://scripts.incutio.com/amazon/) with this thing and try it out... when I find the time :)
