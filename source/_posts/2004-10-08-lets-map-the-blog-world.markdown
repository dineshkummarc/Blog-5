Betrand seems to be really taking off in respect to semantic blogging. I have read lots of interesting posts by him in the last few weeks and sadly didn't have to time to go through them in depth.  Now he posted about [mapping the blog world](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/bertrand/diary/?id=274) and I know he has gone far with this. Just check out his [diary](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/bertrand/diary/) to see all the fun stuff he has been up to. Just take a look [here](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/bertrand/diary/?id=270) for updates on unconstraint relations ala tags. Very cool. Also check out his post on [Semantic blogging engine v 0.2](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/bertrand/diary/?id=249), which gives you some ideas of how he uses trackback to get these things connected. All in all very cool. Please go on Bertrand. This is getting more interesting by the day, even if we haven't chatted yet. Take a look at [Sxip](http://www.sxip.com/) for authentication maybe. Ok... it's getting weird again, I am talking to people through the blog.
