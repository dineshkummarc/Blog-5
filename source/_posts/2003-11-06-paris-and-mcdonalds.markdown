I've been in Paris yesterday and I went to the McDonalds, mostly due to time pressure. And you know what? It sucked. It's totally different than in Germany, Belgium, Italy, Greece, Dominican Republic, United States, ... you name it. I always thought that McDonalds is always the same, everywhere. I was let down. I also didn't see &quot;Je l'aime&quot; (the I'm lovin' it slogan) anywhere. I am very confused now.
