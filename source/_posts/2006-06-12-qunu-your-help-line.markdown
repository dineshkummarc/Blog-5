[Helmar](http://www.helmar.org/) just pinged me that [Qunu](http://qunu.com/) is now live and it is really looking good! The general idea is to connect people who need help with people who want to help out. The interface is clean and simple. The cool thing is that everything happens via your browser, so you don't need to install anything. There are lots of web based IM tools out there but this just uses something that is good for something that is needed. Great stuff. Looking forward to seeing it grow.
