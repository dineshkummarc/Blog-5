There is some good news from Overture and Google. If you are running [Google AdWords](http://adwords.google.com/), you will be happy to know that you can now put several ads in one campaign and they will be auto-optimized for Click-Through. I am currently still doing that by hand but there is also another problem with this. This is optimization for Google, not for the advertiser. The thing is that if you place an ad that has a high click-through and one that has all the necessary information in it, the better clicked one will be shown more but might have a much worse conversion ratio after the click. I'd actually like to see Google optimize on Leads for people using their Conversion Tracker. 

The other news is rather old, but I finally found the page. Overture's [Marketing Console](http://www.content.overture.com/d/USm/ays/mc.jhtml) will allow you to track any online advertising campaigns and the pricing is very interesting as it is based on leads on your site and starts at $150 per month. I am very interested indeed.
