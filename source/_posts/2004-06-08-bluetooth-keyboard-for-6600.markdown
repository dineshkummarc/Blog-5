I always wanted a Bluetooth keyboard for my Palm, but now it gets even better. Based on [this post on MobileWhack](http://www.mobilewhack.com/accessories/bluetooth/usb_keyboard_for_pocket_pcs_and_symbian_os_based_smartphones.html), Think Outside has announced a [Bluetooth Keyboard](http://thinkoutside.com/products/stowaway-bt.html) that works with Symbian phones. What that means is that I need a full text editor for the phone and then I can kind of do everyting on the go with it. It's already a trusted companion, but with a full keyboard, it really does eMail, Word and whatnot. Very nice. Needs to be put on the wishlist.
