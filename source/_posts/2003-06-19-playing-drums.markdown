Yesterday was the day. After several years I was playing drums again and it was a blast. I loved it and it worked better than I would have thought, with a few problems of course :) We actually made music sometimes, even though I mostly made sounds and even the group sometimes made more sounds than music. :) Now I am wondering though if I should go back into making music more often. In case I would, I would have to spend a bit more time on practicing, or rather, any time and time is something that is in high demand at the moment.
