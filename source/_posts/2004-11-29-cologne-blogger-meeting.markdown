Thanks go to Perun for initiating a blogger meeting in cologne. We are the media city, or so they say, and we should get going here. As he mentions in [ title=&quot;Peruns Blog - Webwork und Internet ï¿½ Blogger-Treffen in Koeln&quot;&gt;his post (German)](http://www.perun.net/archiv/2004/11/23/blogger-treffen-in-koeln/#comments) the second or third weekend in January is currently when it is planned. I am voting for the third weekend. He set up a special [wiki page](http://www.perun.net/wiki/BloggerTreff) where you can voice your interest. Go register everyone.
