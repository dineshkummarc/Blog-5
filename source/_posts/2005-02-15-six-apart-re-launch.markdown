Heiko just told me that [Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/) just re-launched their site. Obviously it's in the morning here but I raise my coffee to all the guys and girls in the US currently trying to fix last minute bugs and problems :)

Anyway, Mena talks a bit about the relaunch [in Mena's Corner](http://www.sixapart.com/about/corner/2005/02/new_site_launch.html) and Heiko made clear in [his post on Six Apart Germany](http://www.sixapart.de/archiv/2005/02/frisch_gestrich.html) that the entire backend is based on MovableType and that the images of the people on the site are Six Apart Staff, and sometimes their children obviously as they will likely not employ [that young girls](http://www.sixapart.com/typepad/) :)

All in all I think the site is a great success and makes it a lot clearer what kind of company Six Apart is. It has a bloggy and very personal feel to it, is a little disorganized looking but clearly structured, just like the human brain. Congratulations to all those involved. I presume your next few resumes will come in saying &quot;I want my picture on that site&quot; :)
