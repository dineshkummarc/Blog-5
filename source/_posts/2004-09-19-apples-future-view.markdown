Jeremy Zawodny posted about the [Perfect Search](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000878.php) which was asked for by John Battelle. His view is: &lt;a title=&quot;The Perfect Search?  Ask Apple.&quot; href=&quot;http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/002603.html&quot;&gt;The Perfect Search?  Ask Apple.&lt;/a&gt;

He has a Video online that was done by Apple 10 years ago and I highly suggest watching it. The cool thing is that we are getting there, slowly but surely. Social networking will allow computers to say &quot;Your Friend Peter wrote an article on Blogging.&quot;, having found out about the article via an RSS Feed. The big part in the video is that everything there should help you to navigate through your knowledge. It is starting already. [A9](http://a9.com/) is starting to become my favorite search engine (call it Google+) and I am starting to search my [Bloglines](http://bloglines.com/) and [Furl](http://www.furl.net/) databases more often.
