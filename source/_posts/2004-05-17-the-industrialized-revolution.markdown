Remember disruptive innovation? There is a very nice article at FastCompany about this at the moment, giving a good overview of the problem. 

*&quot;It was as if everybody clapped their hands and suddenly the managers who had been so revered were vilified,&quot; recalls Christensen, with a sad shake of his head. &quot;The dumb-manager theory of business problems just didn't hold water for me. There had to be a deeper reason why smart people would make decisions that lead to failure. I wanted to know why. Why is it so hard to sustain success? Why do good companies fail?&quot;* - &lt;a title=&quot;Fast Company | The Industrialized Revolution&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/76/revolution.html&quot;&gt;Fast Company | The Industrialized Revolution

They also point to [Innosight](http://www.innosight.com/), founded by Clayton Christensen to be a disruptive consultancy in the world of McKinseys. They are argueing that they can make you a growth business far cheaper than these guys can. That might be a company to watch, especially with theorists often not being the best practitioners.
