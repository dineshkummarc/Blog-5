So what do those two have to do in the same headline together? Several things actually. One is that on tuesday [Creative Commons 2.0 was launched](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/archive/2004/05/#4216), simplifying the structure a little bit and getting some initial problems out. Maybe even more interesting than a new version though is somebody really using Creative Commons, somebody big. It seems that the [BBC is looking in a Creative Commons kind of license for their digital archive](http://digital-lifestyles.info/display_page.asp?section=distribution&amp;id=1254)!

This really would potentially mean that you can download and even change lots and lots of the work the BBC has done over the years, building on it, packaging it again, as long as you don't make any money from it. It will be interesting to see what comes out of it, but all in all, great stuff.
