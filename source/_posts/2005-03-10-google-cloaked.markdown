How fun. I read about the cloaking deal a few days ago. The thing is that Google did display some of their FAQ pages differently to search engine bots than to real people, which is why cloaking is all about, in the end trying to get a better ranking through it. Of course, Google is against cloaking. Doing it themselves is fun. Oh, ... ... ... they banned their own pages now ;) More at MarketingVOX: &lt;a title=&quot;Google Bans Own Pages for 'Cloaking'&quot; href=&quot;http://www.marketingvox.com/archives/2005/03/09/google_bans_own_pages_for_cloaking/index.php?rss1&quot;&gt;Google Bans Own Pages for 'Cloaking'.
