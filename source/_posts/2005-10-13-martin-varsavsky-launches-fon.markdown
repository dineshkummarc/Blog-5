[OpenBlog first](http://blog.openbc.com/2005/10/building_a_wifi.html) and [Heiko second](http://www.hebig.com/archives/003435.shtml) pointed me to [Martin's post about FON](http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/new-ideas/share-wifi-build-a-wifi-nation.html), a new system he is starting. Martin did Jazztel, Viatel and Ya.com earlier and now with FON he is building a virtual WiFi company by allowing you to install some software on your Wireless Router. Through this software you get a new login that you can use on all FON enabled routers world wide. That's the basic idea how I understand it and I like it. Martin is doing it in spain and has the funds to do it in other countries, but needs country managers. Feel up for the challenge? Sounds very interesting to say the least.
