As of [this story on news.com](http://news.com.com/Google investors await dropping of 39 million shoes/2100-1024_3-5452983.html?tag=nefd.top), tomorrow is GOOG day in that lots and lots of insiders will be able to sell lots and lots of shares. As they put it:
&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://news.com.com/Google investors await dropping of 39 million shoes/2100-1024_3-5452983.html?tag=nefd.top&quot;&gt;Google investors may find out this week whether there really can be too much of a good thing.

It will be interesting if the stock holds up. On a related note, I had an interesting chat with somebody about the problem of fraudulent clicks on Google's AdWords and AdSense system. I now am starting to believe that there might be mathematical solutions like Fourier Analysis to get around that problem. You don't really filter out the clicks as such, but the anomalies in the traffic gathered. Interesting.

(Cool, news.com has trackbacks!)
