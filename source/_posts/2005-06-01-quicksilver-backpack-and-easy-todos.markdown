Check out the movie posted at 43folders.com about how to use Quicksilver on the Mac (kick ass app!!!) together with a few additions and Backpack as a very easy system to manage your ToDo List a little bit: &lt;a title=&quot;Quicksilver 3s Backpack&quot; href=&quot;http://www.43folders.com/2005/06/quicksilver_3s_.html&quot;&gt;43 Folders: Quicksilver .

I am starting to really not be able to live without Quicksilver. Spotlight is night but Quicksilver is so much more faster for the limited purpose it has.
