Wow. I just watched [Taxi](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0152930). Very cool movie I have to say. I mean the story is a little bit flawed but if you want to see some really amazing car racing then _watch_ _that_ _movie_! 

They even had the problem of getting this filmed because the film is not running faster or something. They are really driving that fast in the city! :)
