This is where the future goes people. [Amazon Web Services](http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/002-4483322-2465638?node=3435361) or [eBay's Developer Program](http://developer.ebay.com/DevProgram/) or the [Google API](http://www.google.com/apis/) are just starting points, showing which way the internet is moving. These things will allow new interactions to form, data to flourish and flow freely and totally new applications to be built. Add XML-RPC based publishing solutions via MovableType or similar tools to the list and the opportunities are endless. I am wondering if this will not get us the information closer to our fingertipps than ever before.
