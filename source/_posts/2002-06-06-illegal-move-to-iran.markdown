Some time in february the MPAA made movie88.com close down. Movie88.com was an online video story which let you lets you download all currently playing movies for $1-1.5 (they will stop working after 3 days). At least that's what I read.

The interesting part is that now film88.com opened, in Teheran (Iran). ;) For more than 20 years there have been no diplomatic relations between the US and the Iran, meaning that the service is relatively save now ;)

At the moment the site seems to have some proxy problems, or so they say. All in all, the idea is interesting, if true.
