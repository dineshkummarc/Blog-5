I returned from a wonderful week in Tunisia yesterday. I had a wonderful time, read a lot, stopped thinking a lot, didn't decide a lot... and all that with great weather. I posted [some photos](http://owt.typepad.com/photos/tunisia_2004/index.html), without people as these would not belong here, to give you an idea of the place in case you are wondering about going. Doesn't show much more than the hotel though. :) As said, I didn't do a lot and moving out of the hotel would have required a decision, which I was trying to avoid at all cost, at least those that require decision more than 1 minute in advance. I am already half back, so some slow posting for another week until I am back fully. Life is good.
