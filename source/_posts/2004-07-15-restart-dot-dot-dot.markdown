[&lt;img alt=&quot;restart&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/restart-thumb.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;37&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/restart.html) There is nothing I can do about this. My computer will restart in a few minutes. There is some new software on there. I have the potential to restart now and there is no way to say &quot;No&quot; to the restart. I do not like this! Grrr... bye. Restarting in 30 seconds.
