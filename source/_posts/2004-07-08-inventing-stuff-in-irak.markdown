This institute for war and peace reporting has a [great article](http://www.iwpr.net/index.pl?archive/arr/arr_200407_124_3_eng.txt) on an Iraki inventor that has build, among others a burglar alarm that takes photos of the burglar in 1964. He now refitted a VW Beetle to run only on solar power. Lots of interesting stuff in there.
