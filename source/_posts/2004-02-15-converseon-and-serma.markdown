Some time ago I [posted about Conversion and SERMA](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/01/search_engine_r.html), their search engine reputation management engine. Now Rob Key from Converseon left a comment on my blog in relation to my post. I am not sure where I talked about them using &quot;dark arts&quot; (as he puts it) to improve search engine rankings of their clients. They seem to improve the search engine positioning on key terms to push off other sites in the index that are well listed. To do this, they would essentially have to publish 10 or more pages in relation to one keyword and be listed very well for those to clear the first page of a search engine results page. To manage the voice of the web, I think positive communication is key. If somebody talks bad about your company, they have a reason and their voice will be found. You can talk directly to them and try to understand their reasoning. This can essentially be possible by using Google Alert to monitor key terms. This does not reduce the value of what Converseon does, but does offer a different route. The most interesting thing about Converseon is still that their message is highly geared to the marketing experts out there and will make them believe that they can regain control, which they can't. Converseon can bring the importance of search engine marketing foreward, I do believe, but be carefuly to believe that you can control the results in search engines in any way. Still, thanks a lot to Key for commenting here, showing that they are looking at what people think and have a working technology to manage conversation about their company. As a proof of concept, this is perfect. Heads up to them for that.
