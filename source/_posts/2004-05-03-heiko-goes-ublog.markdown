Congratulations to [Heiko Hebig](http://www.hebig.com/) for his new position at uBlog/Six Apart to promote [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com/) and MovableType in Germany! He's the perfect man for the job, at least from the little interaction I had with him up will now. He revealed his new position in a post entitled: &lt;a title=&quot;I am blogging this&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hebig.com/archives/002049.shtml&quot;&gt;I am blogging this and I am happy to see that [Nico is still smiling](http://nico.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=194), even though two of the great blogging minds in Germany will now go head to head as Nico is working on [Blogg.de](http://www.blogg.de/). 

Again congratulations to Heiko and as well to Loic and the team at uBlog, for picking a great person for pushing TypePad and MovableType further in Europe! Good luck.
