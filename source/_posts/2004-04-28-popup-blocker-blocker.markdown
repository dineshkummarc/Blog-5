&lt;I&gt;Online ad management firm Falk eSolutions AG has bowed technology that detects pop-up blockers and automatically converts pop-up and pop-under inventory into alternate rich media formats, mostly floating ads, on the fly.&lt;/I&gt; Source: &lt;a title=&quot;Falk Offers Pop-up Blocker Workaround&quot; href=&quot;http://www.clickz.com/news/article.php/3345761&quot;&gt;Falk Offers Pop-up Blocker Workaround&lt;/a&gt;

Of course the fallout from Popups hasn't even fully started yet, but Nico already talked about the Powerlayer [here](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/01/popups_are_dead.html) back in the beginning of 2004. I believed him then, and now he is proven :)
