I really liked the post from The Big Picture entitled [iPod shuffle = new radio ?](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2005/01/ipod_shuffle_ne.html). Why? Because it is true. The iPod shuffle is the first step in that direction and things like [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/) are even going further giving you your music whereever you are. In a sense their profile radio allows you to have a shuffle that includes the new songs that match your music list. Like I would do an Autofill in iTunes including all the file lists I have from other people in my iTunes list through Rendez-vous.
