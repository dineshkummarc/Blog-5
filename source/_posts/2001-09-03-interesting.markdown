I just eat a rollo with salami. And that's not this sweet chocolate rollo ;)

It's like a very thin pizza with tomato, cheeze (as usual for a pizza) plus salad (could be totally mixed, I had green salad and onions) plus tzatziki or some other sauce ( I too arabic which is a bit more spicy) and then (for me) salami (you could take ham or something else you would put on a pizza). All this is accumulated in the middle just like with a pita and then rolled up and rounded up with a few spices over it. Then it's baked just like a pizza (obviously the cheeze just melts inside).

As I don't think anyone remotely understood that I will just say that it was very tasty. Interesting.
