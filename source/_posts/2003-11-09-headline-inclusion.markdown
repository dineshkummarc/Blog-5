I just installed [RSSlib](http://www.2rss.com/) on Ennead to be able to [display my latest posts on the frontpage](http://ennead.de/). In reality, it also allows anyone to add these headlines to their own page. What you need to do is somehow include [this url](http://ennead.de/includes/rss/rss2html.php?rss_url=http://ennead.de/blog/index.rdf&amp;rss_items=3&amp;rss_chars=60).

This will add my latest 3 items with 60 characters quoted on the page. You can actually do that with any RSS feed and it remains to be seen what I can do with it. For more documentation about it you can go [here](http://ennead.de/includes/rss/docs.htm).
