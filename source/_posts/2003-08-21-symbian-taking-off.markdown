It seems that [Symbian is taking off](http://www.symbian.com/press-office/2003/pr030821.html)! I mean Q2 2002 had 90.000 Symbian based mobile phones sold and Q2 2003 had 1.490.000 phones based on Symbian sold! Now that's growth. Royalties moved from 230k in H1 2002 to 2.68m in H1 2003. That's over 1000%! Goodie.
