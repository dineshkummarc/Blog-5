I just read Ross Mayfield's post &lt;a title=&quot;Wikis Anonymous&quot; href=&quot;http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2004/09/wikis_anonymous.html&quot;&gt;Wikis Anonymous&lt;/a&gt; and it includes (among others) a wonderful quote which is very nice for those working with Wiki's ;):

&lt;I&gt;Please, grant me the serenity to accept the pages I cannot edit, The courage to edit the pages I can, And the wisdom to know the difference â€”The Wiki Prayer&lt;/I&gt;
