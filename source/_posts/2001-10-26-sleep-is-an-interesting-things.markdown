Well, it turns out that yesterday night I talked in my sleep. The interesting thing is what I said (translated from german):

Me: It's Green. It's green.... green it is.
Avonia: Oliver?
Me: Green!

...

Hmmm... Now she really wondered what I was talking about that night and I have no clue whatsoever. But it brought me thinking again about the fact that you can remember all your dreams if you want to. All you have to do is all day, focus on stuff that is right, like how the light shines in the room, how the clock is ticking, where the TV is, how the pictures are hanging, how the world looks, ... anything. Then when you dream you can suddenly find things that are just not right and the cool thing there is that after some time you can notice that you are dreaming and can say &quot;Cool, let's see how flying works&quot;. This would really rock. The problem I see is that you will not have real dreams anymore. Or at least the danger is there that you will not have dreams you don't fully remember and as humans are trying to work through the emotional problems they had/have in their dreams that might just be a bit dangerous I think. So I will leave it at wondering what was green :)
