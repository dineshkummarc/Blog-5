Ever since getting to know Stefan and Felix from [Plazes](http://www.plazes.com/) and Martin from [FON](http://fon.com/) I thought the two would be a match made in heaven and now their collaboration is out. Martin [blogged about it](http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/general/plazes-.html) and so [did Felix](http://blog.plazes.com/?p=94) and I am happy to know that Plazes will be the system of choice for displaying and finding FON hotspots world wide. I already bought my FON router directly from them (roughly 50 EURs including VAT and shipping) and am looking forward to getting it online at my home. With a little extra antenna it might even reach the outside pub they are building at the other side of the lake here, which might be interesting. Once the Plazes Symbian client comes out I hope to be able to quickly check on my mobile phone where the local FON plazes are and then just log in there for free as a Linus, sharing my hotspot with others too. These two start-ups have a great future ahead of them. Cool.

I also already wrote to the FON for possibly sponsoring the next [WebMontag](http://www.webmontag.de/) in Cologne, as it might be the perfect crowd to get a bit more traction in Germany. I sadly haven't heard back from them yet, but presume that this will happen soon when they find a way out under their email load. I actually didn't mail Martin directly this time but rather the main info line in the presumption that Martin will be too busy anyway and he still has a family to take care off ;)
