Thanks to Charlie ([link](http://cognections.typepad.com/lifeblog/2006/06/widsets_mobile_.html)) I just found out about [Widsets](https://www.widsets.com). If you have a Nokia N70, or actually it seems to work with any Java Phone, then go right ahead and get this little puppy for your mobile phone. I just started with it and am already enjoying myself. [here](http://blog.widsets.com/widsets/2006/06/widsets_is_on_t.html) you can find the launch message from their own blog. They just started on the 6th of this month. Cool.
