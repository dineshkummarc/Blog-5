I just read over at [news.com](http://news.com/) that [Second Life](http://secondlife.com/) has just become &lt;a title=&quot;'Second Life' membership now free | CNET News.com&quot; href=&quot;http://news.com.com/Second Life membership now free/2100-1043_3-5855481.html?tag=nefd.top&quot;&gt;free for all&lt;/a&gt;. For all those not in the know, Second Life is a virtual world... a real world, just virtual.

When they started out they also employed an economist to set up the economy within that world, the way of buying and trading stuff. Of course to buy things within Second Life you need to buy Lindenbucks. And Voila ... welcome Second Life the bank. Or rather Linden Labs the bank, as they run the place.

You buy Lindenbucks, and Second Life gets bucks, puts them on the bank and if all goes well you never want your bucks back because your are trading in Lindenbucks. Growing the world will mean more bucks in their hands. Making people trade more means more bucks in their hands. And that's millions and millions just on the bank and you can do stuff with that. They must have a good securities trading department I'd say. 

There are actually people making money in such a virtual world, building virtual cars and things. Of course, people also have to pay a fee of $25 for land they own, you know, that's the tax bit. but if you put a hotel on there and have a nice beach you can earn hansomly. :) 

The article states that Linden Lab makes $400.000 a month without membership fees. Congratulations people! Lots of great ideas in that space.
