Everyone knows I truely believe in web services, or rather the idea behind it. Now I just read that [eBay  [is] sold on Web services](http://news.com.com/eBay sold on Web services/2100-7345_3-5245074.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5245074&amp;subj=news.7345.20) and they are expanding their web services offering so more people can dig into their backend and build cool stuff. I love it. This actually is one of the reasons I might be interested in investing in eBay after all. Truely wonderful things can come out of this. Order will build at the edge of chaos and eBay will come out stronger because of it. Wonderful. Now we can build cool stuff interlinking Amazon, eBay, Google, Paypal, ... who else? :) Check out [the eBay Dev Program](http://developer.ebay.com/DevProgram/) for more info.
