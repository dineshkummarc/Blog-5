Either from Samsung directly or from Cyberport. We recently bought a [Samsung LE-32 R32 LCD TV](http://www.cyberport.de/item/1852/1252/0/80334/samsung-le-32-r-32-b-lcd-tv-32-zoll---81-cm--hd-ready--restposten-.html) for the Office (to complement the Wii ;)) and now two of our developers have bought the same machine directly from Cyberport. Damn! And yes, I am too lazy to add it to my product suggestions on the right at the moment and yes, I don't make any money from Cyberport. It's a very fine 32&quot; monitor for 550 EURs. Great machine.

But people from Cyberport, if you find lots of sales of the last Samsungs happening right now referred via me, send one to my address. Just search for Oliver Thylmann in your database :) Or just talk to Samsung for them to give me one. ;)
