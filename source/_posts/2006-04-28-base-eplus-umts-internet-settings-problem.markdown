If you get an error message of 3.0.10:80 in Opera Mini on your Nokia N70 with the german provider Base (meaning you use the ePlus network settings) you will have to go into your setup, then the extended setup via options and remove the proxy server. As long as you have that in there you will not be able to surf with the phone, at least that was the problem for me. Damn automatic settings.
