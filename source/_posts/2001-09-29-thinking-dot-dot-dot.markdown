Late at night, 3:22 am. Have been drinking with a friend, watching TV in the old place. Just read that Adrian is making is journal friends only. Thinking about the same thing. I should use the public one for some article type posts which will appear on the front page of my home page. anyway...

I think, not sure, that I just saw part, or even more, of &quot;Behind the Veil&quot; that Scot was [talking about](http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?itemid=11241264&amp;nc=13) recently. It was on ARTE and it was really interesting. It's about what a woman has filmed in Afghanistan. Partly her own tape and partly from a movement by women against the Taleban inside Afghanistan. Really interesting and really shocking. The thing is that those people believe that they brought back order in the country, which might be right, but the method seems very very harsh. I just don't think that bringing order equals bringing order. The means to do that are important in the entire picture. And the Taleban are killing or at least putting to jail anyone that is against them and they even said so publicly in front of the camera.

My only problem is that I do not yet understand the Taleban. Before passing a judgement I would like to understand them. And you just don't go &quot;Let's kill anyone against us&quot; without a reason. I would really like to dig into their brains to see what is behind all this. They seem to really believe in what they are saying. Then again, I can't even pretend to understand what was the reasoning behind Nazi germany. Then again, under the idea that what Jews did (just the belief that they did that) was totally bad, I could see the reasoning. And I don't even have that with the Taleban that. But I would like to get there. Much more digging to do.

The show before that was interesting though on ARTE. They showed how all these things evolved. Pakistan for example supported the Taleban partly because a pipeline that would go through Afghanistan would go through Pakistan. Pakistan wanted that. Otherwise it would go through russia, but that was not something the country where the gas originated wanted. The other option would be the Iran but that would be against US laws to not allow any help whatsoever to the Iran. So Pakistan wanted a government that they are supportive of in Afghanistan and that is partly why they supported the Taleban. All this is so much more complicated than we even remotely understand it isn't even funny. ...

Hmm...
