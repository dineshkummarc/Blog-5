The wonderful, charming and intelligent Keith  ([HIRE THIS FOOL!](http://www.pelczarski.com/keith.htm)) has added me as an intelligent voice on his new journal at [www.gonutty.com](http://www.gonutty.com/). Thanks Keith! I would like to add him as a friend in my [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/) but sadly he is using the competing [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/). Now I will have to check out another page every day to look at the ramblings of another of my friends. A well,. [check it out](http://www.gonutty.com/).
