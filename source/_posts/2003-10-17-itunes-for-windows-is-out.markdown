There we have it. Apple has released &lt;a title=&quot;Apple - iTunes&quot; href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/itunes/&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; for Windows. I am downloading the application as we speak and am really looking forward to seeing it in Windows. It is one of the best working Music Players/Rippers/Burners/Radio... I have used yet and I want it to be similar in Windows. We'll see. Sadly I can't use the iTunes store yet as it is only available in the US.
