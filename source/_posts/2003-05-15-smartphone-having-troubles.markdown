Seems like Microsoft is really having trouble with getting a foodhold in the market for their Smartphone. &lt;a title=&quot;CNET.com - News - Investor - News - Story&quot; href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/investor/news/newsitem/0-9900-1028-21210109-0.html&quot;&gt;T-Mobile just dropped Smartphone&lt;/a&gt; for a future phone. The article doesn't make clear why it was dropped and if there was some pressure from other players, but the thing is that the mobile phone manufacturers really do not want a microsoft in their ranks. And in essence, Smartphone doesn't have a chance against Symbian, at least not in the general market. What they are doing is focussing on the high ARPU market, where they do have a chance. MS has a long breath, and we will see how it pans out.
