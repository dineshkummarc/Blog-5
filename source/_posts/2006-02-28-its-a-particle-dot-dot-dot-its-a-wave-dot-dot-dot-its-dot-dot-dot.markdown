Having studied physics once, I am still amazed at stuff like this. Check out the following video on Google. A real must see: [Quantum Physics Double Slit Experiment - What The Bleep Movie - Google Video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4237751840526284618&amp;q=quantum).

I think scientists should do more things like this to make sure they get their funding. After you have seen the video, ask yourself if you want us to know more about this and whether something good will come out of it or if you think it is a waste of money.

And here is the newest feature of Google video. You can now put this directly on your site.
