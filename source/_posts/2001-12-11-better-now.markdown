I was at the doctors on monday and it seems I am well again. My lung capacity is at 70-90% again which means that the problems were most likely due to the, it seems very heavy, infection that I had. My cough is also better which means I should be fine.

My lungs are still easily attacked and I will continue to take medicine to get my lung 100% back on track for sure until the end of the week and I will continue to take Asthma treatment once a day for roughly a month just to be sure that nothing happens until I go again in January. 

More will be looked at then but 99% of this seems to be due to infection.

So I am all fine and well. I even ran a bit ;)
