Want to get your own personal video recorder of the world wide TV sceen on your windows pc (no mac version available as of now) then [Videora](http://www.videora.com/en-us/) might be your tool. I have yet to try it out but based on [this post](http://www.masternewmedia.org/news/2005/01/03/bittorrent_rss_ondemand_personal.htm) it looks very nice. It uses RSS and BitTorrent to feed and distribute files about TV shows. Very cool.
