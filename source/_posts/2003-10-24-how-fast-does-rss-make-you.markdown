I have to agree with Scoble here. RSS can allow you to read a lot of sites out there at amazing speed. It works a lot better than a browser where you need to open each site and kind of find out what's new. [Check his points](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/10/18.html#a5107) for some good explanations though.
