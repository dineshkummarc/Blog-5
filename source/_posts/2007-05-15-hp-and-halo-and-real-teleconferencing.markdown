John has a [great post](http://battellemedia.com/archives/003632.php) online about HP's [HALO](http://www.hp.com/halo/index.html) system, used for teleconferencing and just looking at the images makes you drool. Just take a look.

It's really what Apple is trying to do on your laptop but using real hardware (with real costs ;)) and 4 42&quot; LCD Screens to create an environment where you feel you are sitting at the table with the other people. A round table around the world. Very cool.
