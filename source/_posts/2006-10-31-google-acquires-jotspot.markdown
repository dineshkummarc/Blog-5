Now that is good news. [JotSpot](http://jot.com) has been acquired by [Google](http://google.com). We are using JotSpot as our corporate wiki and are pretty happy with it as it is, but things will now likely improve.

Jot is currently sending around this email, which explains a bit about the acquisition.

*JotSpot is now part of Google*

*We're writing to let you know that Google has acquired JotSpot. We believe this is great news for our users. More importantly, we want to reassure you that you'll continue to have uninterrupted access to your account. Both Google and JotSpot are committed to supporting our customers, and we understand that users have invested a lot in our products. In the near-term, we're focused on migrating JotSpot to Google's systems and datacenters. We'll work hard to make that move as seamless as possible so that customers won't be inconvenienced.*

*Why is Google acquiring JotSpot?*

*Google shares JotSpot's vision for helping people collaborate, share and work together online. JotSpot's team and technology are a strong fit with existing Google products like Google Docs &amp; Spreadsheets and Google Groups.*

*What does this mean for JotSpot customers?*

*We believe that joining Google will accelerate our team's vision of offering users the best collaboration platform on the web. Google shares that vision and presents us with the world's best environment for delivering on it. We'll be taking advantage of Google's world-class systems infrastructure and operations expertise to ensure that access to your JotSpot is fast and reliable. We can't share any of our plans publicly just yet, but we can tell you that we're incredibly excited about the possibilities. We can't think of a better company to have been acquired by.*

*Will paying customers still be charged?*

*We will no longer be billing customers for the use of the service. Although you will still have use of the product at your current pricing plan, we won't charge you anymore when your current billing cycle expires.*

*What about security and privacy?*

*Your data is yours â€” that doesn't change at Google. We will continue to work to ensure the privacy and security of your data. Furthermore, Google is as committed to privacy and security as we are. Since the user information you provided to JotSpot will soon be transferred to Google as part of their acquisition of JotSpot, we want to provide you with the opportunity to retrieve your user information and cease usage of the JotSpot service before the transition. If you do not wish to continue using JotSpot, send an email to privacy@jot.com in the next sixty days and we will reply with instructions for retrieving your user information.*

*Answers to more frequently asked questions are available at http://www.jot.com/. If you have any other questions, please email support@jot.com.*

*In closing, we wanted to offer our sincere gratitude to you â€” our customers â€” for believing in us and helping us achieve success. We look forward to continuing that relationship at Google.*

*Best wishes,
The JotSpot Team

Congratulations to the team! I got my first into to JotSpot by Joe Krauss in 2004, which I first [hinted at](http://blog.thylmann.net/2004/09/06/wiki-and-then-some/) and then could [post about](http://blog.thylmann.net/2004/10/06/jotspot-launches/).
