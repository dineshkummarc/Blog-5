Is this only me or are the &lt;a title=&quot;Apple - iTunes - Videos&quot; href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/itunes/videos/&quot;&gt;Apple iTunes Videos, or more specifically, the Series like Lost, only available in the US? If I log in to the Music Store I do not see any of the Disney Series that are supposed to be there? What do you mean Steve? I can't watch Lost 1 day after it aired in the US? Who the hell cares that I am in Germany. I don't have the time to watch Lost when they want me to here in Germany and I do not want to watch it in German but in English and now what? WHERE ARE MY SERIES!!! :)
