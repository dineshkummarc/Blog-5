Ok, from time to time the trashing is going a bit far, so I thought I'd highlight some of the good sides of the event, which for me still outweigh the bad sides. First of all, there were by far enough power plugs for laptops in the conference room itself, which was amazing. The event location was very good all in all and this time, I have to say that for dealing with 1000 people, food was very good indeed. Both of those were large complaints of the last events and they have been fixed.

The total group of people that was there was a very good mix, and in light of the basic idea having come from an un-conference, the networking was very good. And this is actually a large part of what an un-conference is about for me. There were also some real highlights in the talks like Hans or the second life panel. That there was a start-up room was great, and we got two VC contacts through that. The party was also good and and in total I had a great time!

As I said before, the biggest problem, and where all the else originate, of the event, is that it has outgrown the un-conference part and that makes it a hard to manage cross-bread. Thanks for the event Loic, keep your head up and decide on where you want to go with it.

(P.S. it is going to far anyway, with now Sam Sethi from Techcrunch UK [being fired](http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=322) over it.)
