I tried [Chitika](https://chitika.com/mm_overview.php?refid=othylmann) for a few days now and it does perform reasonably well. As always, specific numbers can't be discussed but dependent on your audience, I think you can make some good money with them. If you are more product focussed then the ads might fit very well. I am sticking with AdSense for most stuff for now, but will likely play around with Chitika here and there in special situations. And if you want to try it out, [you can](https://chitika.com/mm_overview.php?refid=othylmann) and if you use [this link](https://chitika.com/mm_overview.php?refid=othylmann) then I get 10% of your revenue... or rather, you get all your revenue and Chitika gets less, as I get 10% of what you make on top. Good deal for me. So all you people at the big portals out there, get it and put it on your page if you don't want Google for any reason. You can also target the queries to special terms! :)

Ok, that was a lame excuse to post something, but I truely like Chitika, have heard lots of good stuff about them and if anyone wants to use me as a referral, then go right ahead. 

**Update**: You can  still try it out, but I ended up using it very little and now they have gone to the obvious problem that they have a lot of clicks that are really not relevant. See more [here](http://www.jensense.com/archives/2005/11/eminimalls_ad_u.html).
