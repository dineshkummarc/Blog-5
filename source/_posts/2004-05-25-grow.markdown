Thanks to Nico's &lt;a title=&quot;Noch'n Blogg&quot; href=&quot;http://nico.blogg.de/&quot;&gt;Noch'n Blogg I had the pleasure to play [Grow](http://www.kiteretsu.jp/on/grow3/index.html), growing the planet just the right way, ending up just below 10.000 the last try. I can still do better and agree with Nico, fun play.
