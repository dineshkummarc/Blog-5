Some time ago, I linked to the [RSS Primer](http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000863.php), a guide for publishers to RSS. This same guide is now linked by Amy Gahran from her [Contentious Blog](http://blog.contentious.com/). You can find it in her article entitled [What is RSS, and why should I care?](http://blog.contentious.com/archives/000038.html). This is a very good introduction for all those who don't know what good it will do for them, as a user.
