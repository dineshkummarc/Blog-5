Ping Identity Corporation is working on a &quot;federated identity infrastructure&quot; and they just [got $5 million to work on it](http://www.pingidentity.com/pingid.php?section=news&amp;releaseid=39)! They are behind [SourceID](http://www.sourceid.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp) for example. Not 100% sure what they are really doing yet but it sounds very powerful and likely needs another look :)
