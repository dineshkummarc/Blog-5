A friend of mine recently signed up for DSL with T-Online and added a Wavelan basestation to the mix. Right out of the box, to make it easy most likely, the base station's SSID is *Wavelan* and it's fully open. In the end, this means that everybody who cluelessly gets a nocat equiped DSL Account at T-Online, will be an open hotspot. This might be a very big number of hotspots. It is likley to, sadly, change soon based on [this problem](http://www.roell.net/weblog/archiv/2004/02/26/spass_mit_tonline_email_und_wlans.shtml) being that on top of giving out open Wavelan basestation, T-Online also allows people to check their eMail without using their POP3 Password when they are online via their standard T-Online Account. So now, somebody is online with their standard T-Online Account, using a T-Online Wavelan gateway and then everybody can listen in and then raid their eMail Inbox :)

Damn, I so wanted these Hotspots to appear all over Germany :)
