Wow. My mother just called. Did I ever tell you that my parents are going nuts on their old age? ;)

They just called to tell me that they rented a place on the cost of Belgium (my parents live in Brussels) for several months this summer starting May. Right at the sea front next to the beach. It rocks! I really don't know what went into them, but quite frankly I do not really care ;)

This place is just 2 hours or so by car from where I am (Aachen/Germany) and this means that I will be able to have a few days of relaxing from time to time at the cost in belgium. It is even big enough to bring some friends (some, not many ;)).

I really have to be very thankful to be blessed with so wonderful parents. And no this is not just because they just rented the place. I have so much to thank them for it is amazing and I will try my best to pay them back to the best of my abilitiy.

To quote the Dalai Lama: Live a good, honorable life. Then, when you get older and think back, you'll be able to enjoy it a second time.
