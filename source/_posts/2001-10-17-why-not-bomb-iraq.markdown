Some people speculated that iraq might have something to do with the terrorist attacks. Well now I just read an article that Iraq is the most important Oil exporter after Saudi-Arabia and if they were bombed, the flow of oil would stop (2 million barrels per day) and the oil price would probably go to 40 dollar. Just another puzzle of the wonderful picture unfolding.

Still being puzzled about all of this trying to think of other things but sometimes failing.
