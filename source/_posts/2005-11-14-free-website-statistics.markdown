Hosted web sites statistics services are a bandwidth intensive game, but Google obviously has bandwidth oozing out of their server ports. When buying Urchin it was only a question of time when a free service would emerge. Welcome [Google Analystics](http://www.google.com/analytics), the re-birth of Urchin. It's free up to 5 million pageviews a month, and continues to be free if you have an adwords account pushing traffic to your web site. Search Engine Roundtable has a good article on the move entitled &lt;a title=&quot;Google Analytics (ex-Urchin) Delivers Web Analytics for FREE&quot; href=&quot;http://www.seroundtable.com/archives/002791.html&quot;&gt;Google Analytics (ex-Urchin) Delivers Web Analytics for FREE&lt;/a&gt;.

I already installed the code on the site and am looking forward to see the first reports. Sadly these will take 12 hours to appear, which I presume comes from the fact that they have a very efficient logging server that simply tracks hits. These optimized log files then still need to be analysed and pushed into the client accounts. More to come when I have a clearer view of the service offerings.

&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Almost 24 hours later, no statistics collected yet. The system is still saying there is a problem and I should check the status and the status says all is fine. We'll see. The site is still slow.

&lt;strong&gt;Update 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Just went through bloglines and read [the TechCrunch post](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/11/14/google-analytics-swings-at-measure-map/) about Google Analytics. The update Michael posted is interesting. It seems that Google &quot;forgot&quot; to tell the old subscribers to Urchin who paid $200 per month for the service that the switch was happening. Just check [Ethan's post](http://onotech.blogspot.com/2005_11_01_onotech_archive.html#113200904055483341) for what he experience, moving from a $200 (happily paid) working version of Urchin, to a totally unresponsive free version of Google Analytics.

&lt;strong&gt;Update 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Over 30 hours now and still not statistics, because people are starting to ask if I see something and no, I don't, as does [Jeremy](http://www.ensight.org/archives/2005/11/15/google-blahnalytics/) from b5media. A well.
