I just took a look at the Renaul Scenic and I have to say that it's nice to see the automobile industry thinking what they customers and users really want. While I do think that Renault has a weird design philosophy, this car is very well thought through and especially the little details are amazing. 

For one, every seat at the back has a full 3 point belt, and with one move, the back side moves done, pull another trigger and the seat (there are three distinct ones) moves up to the front. 6 short moves and you have a huge trunk, and this is doable without a problem by a wife with kids. You also have a small fridge in the middle of the car between the front seats, with a light in it of course. Big enough to fit three liter water bottles without a problem. Above the head on the left the drive can put her sun glasses, in a nicely cushioned place. You also have trays at the seats in the back, as well as two 12 volt power outlets ready for use. Then of course there are drawers below front seats to store more stuff. Imagine you have kids and they sit in the back. You would have to turn arround and look if they are ok, unless of course to fold down the second mirror from the roof to look at them via that mirror. It's all those little details that make you go wow each and every time.

Lovely car.
