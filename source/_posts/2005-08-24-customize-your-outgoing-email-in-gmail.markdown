Yes! You can now customize your outgoing eMail Address in GMail, meaning that you can enter a different eMail into your GMail account that is used as the From: Address in all outgoing eMails. This makes the POP and SMTP access a lot more convenient if you are really using it for another eMail address that you just forward to GMail. Here is the Help Center page about it: [Gmail:Help Center](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?ctx=%67mail&amp;hl=en&amp;answer=20616).
