Loic posted about [preparing the conference room and wifi](http://lesblogs.typepad.com/blog/2005/12/preparing_the_c.html) for Les Blogs. There are 150 power plugs and 6 mbit/s downstream, 4 mbit/s upstream, spread over 20 nocat hotspots. Good stuff to start with. Looking forward to seeing the room buzzing with action when arrive on monday around 12:00. See you there.
