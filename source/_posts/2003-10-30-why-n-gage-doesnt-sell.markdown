Let's put it like this. It doesn't sell for places that sell it as a gaming platform. Two things here.

1. Gamers hate it and hated it since E3, or so it seems. 
2. Placed that sell it as a game deck, don't subsidise it with their monthly airtime...

Telecom providers do! They are selling it for 150â‚¬ and more off the standard price. I can now have the N-Gage for 180â‚¬ easily as a phone and will likely find it for less. It won't sell like this in retail outlets that focus on games, especially because it needs a network connection anyway. 

It'll be interesting to see what Nokia does next. Check out a bit more about this [at this The Register story](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/68/33680.html).
