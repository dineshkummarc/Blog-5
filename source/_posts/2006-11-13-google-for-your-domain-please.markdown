Ok, now I am starting to have enough. Google is now [posting on their blog](http://adwords.blogspot.com/2006/11/google-tools-for-smbs-part-1-of-2.html) about among others [Google Apps for your Domain](https://www.google.com/a/?utm_medium=et&amp;utm_source=awblog&amp;utm_campaign=gafyd). And you know what, I have been asking for it for some time and actually registered several times but I have the slight feeling that having been denied in the early beta period means that I don't get through now. I would really like to have an account please. Just search for Oliver Thylmann in your database, there should be several. Or otherwise, please stop posting about it.

Otherwise I'd like to hear anyones suggestions for a hosted corporate email system. Fusemail currently has SMTP Problems again for many hours and while they are otherwise good, I am not so thrilled that I wouldn't move.

**Update**: Not even 24 hours later, the problem is solved! Thank you Google Team :)
