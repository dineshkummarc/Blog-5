Kevin Site, a CNN journalist in Northern Irak, has been asked to stop posting to his &lt;a title=&quot;Kevin Sites Blog&quot; href=&quot;http://www.kevinsites.net/2003_03_16_archive.html#200025634&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. Pretty sad to hear that. They could at least have integrated the blog into CNN if they believe he is not spending that time on work related tasks.
