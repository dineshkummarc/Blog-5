I just read Dvorak's piece entitled [Googlepedia: The End is Near](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1764757,00.asp) about Google's plan to [help Wikipedia](http://slashdot.org/articles/05/02/10/2355202.shtml?tid=217) with a hosting kind of deal. (I do presume they could call it practicing hosting external sites for a potential future service but never mind me, back to the subject at hand ;)). What I really liked about the opinion piece, was the final line, in which he touches upon the fact that the Google guys are actually nice people but they are now part of a public corporation, and no matter if you want to or not, that changes things.

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1764757,00.asp&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those nice guys are not working for themselves any more. We always have to remember that. They are now guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Good stuff to remember.
