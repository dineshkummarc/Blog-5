As far as Conferences go, Web 2.0 was amazing. But the density of amazing people in relation to all the speakers is probably higher at the &lt;a title=&quot;World Business Forum&quot; href=&quot;http://www.wbfeurope.com/&quot;&gt;World Business Forum&lt;/a&gt;. They start October 19th to 20th in Frankfurt/Germany and here is the list of the speakers: Rudy Giuliani, Michael Porter, Jack Welch, Philip Kotler, Tom Peters, Stephen Covey, Helmut Kohl. Boy oh boy what a list.
