If it is anything like they say it is, the &lt;a title=&quot;ManyOne Networks&quot; href=&quot;http://www.manyone.net/homesite/download.html&quot;&gt;ManyOne Universal Browser&lt;/a&gt; might need it's own category. But a 100MB download is now available. Check out what it is about. Sounds mighty interesting, very psychedelic and all that. I will write more once I know more and tried it out. Update: Up till now, it sucks pants as they say ;) But ok, it's a beta. Still looking.
