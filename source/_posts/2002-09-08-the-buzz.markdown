This might be a fun page to check out from time to time:

http://buzz.yahoo.com/

It's the yahoo search engine ranking. 

On a side note, today is my last day before going to work 5 days a week for 6 months ... hmmm... I am actually looking really forward to it though as the job seems to be really fun. We will see tomorrow. Now going out with a few friends, with one of whom having run is own restaurant/coffee shop for a week now. Let's see how he is feeling :)
