In his latest articles on arbitrage on the internet, Seth, whom I thankfully met last week in Cologne, goes really deep. He finishes by saying:

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://majestic.typepad.com/seth/2005/06/food_for_wormsk.html&quot;&gt;This weekend maybe I will sit down with him outside, on the grass, dig into the soil with my hand and pick up a worm. &quot;Do you remember that scene from Phantom Tollbooth, where they are selling words? Well, when the words go stale and nobody wants them, do you know what happens to them?&quot; I am not sure how he will respond. But I will take the worm, put it in his hand, and say &quot;The worms eat the words.&quot; And he will probably look at me like I am joking and being the smartie that he is, will ask &quot;And what do the worms do with them?&quot; And O'll tell him frankly &quot;Why, the worms feed the words to Google.&quot; And he will laugh, and I will laugh.

But I wont be kidding

Check the full article, to at least 10% grasp it, here: &lt;a title=&quot;Media Futures,  Part 5/5: ARBITRAGE:  V. Therapy&quot; href=&quot;http://majestic.typepad.com/seth/2005/06/food_for_wormsk.html&quot;&gt;TRANSPARENT BUNDLES by Seth Goldstein: Media Futures,  Part 5/5: ARBITRAGE:  V. Therapy. Great stuff Seth, great stuff.
