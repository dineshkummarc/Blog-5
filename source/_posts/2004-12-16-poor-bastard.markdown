&lt;p&gt;A 19 year old kid stole a car in Cologne. He was caught driving too fast and the police tried to stop him, but he drove away (again too fast, obviously) and crashed into something.&amp;nbsp; He then continued to flee on foot.&amp;nbsp; He has been charged with theft, leaving the scene of an accident, dangerous driving, not having a driving license and driving under the influence of drugs. What a list!&amp;nbsp; :) ([Source](http://www.ksta.de/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=ksta/XPage&amp;atype=ksArtikel&amp;aid=1102949456826))&lt;/p&gt;
