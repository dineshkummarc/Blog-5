It seems that there is a &lt;a title=&quot;Welcome to Republicons.org&quot; href=&quot;http://www.republicons.org/view_article.asp?RP_ARTICLE_ID=565&quot;&gt;Blacklist at the Oscars&lt;/a&gt;. This is about not letting several people speak up who are against the war. Namely George Clooney, Dustin Hoffman, Spike Lee, Meryl Streep, Sean Penn, ... This is getting very scary indeed.
