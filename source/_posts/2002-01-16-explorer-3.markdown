I have to say that from time to time MS really knows how to build something that is nice. My old mouse broke down and it was a real pain moving the mouse pointer around. Saturday I bought an MS Intellimouse Explorer 3, the optical one and I have to say that I love it. It works so much better than any other mouse I have used! Plain wonderful.
