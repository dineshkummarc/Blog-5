Cringely write [a great post](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20060511.html) once again. Let me share this paragraph:

*And look at those Google ads. Here's the most important key to Google's success: Most Google advertisers don't advertise ANYWHERE else. Its mainly small and medium sized companies whose advertisements the average person would NEVER have seen before the Internet. Google is making a ton of money from people who never advertised before. Heck, Google is making a ton of money from people who never were even in business before. This is not only a fundamental change in how advertising is done; it is a fundamental change in how BUSINESS is done.
*

Listen. Think. This is exactly what I have been telling people. What Google has done is not to build a better advertising platform, but to make advertising into sales. It's not fully there yet because a click isn't a sales for somebody with no web site but the advertising market is moving there. And the thing is that you suddenly have a totally different negotiation base, because you are not pitching for the marketing budget but for the sales budget, which is unlimited if you provide sales profitably.
