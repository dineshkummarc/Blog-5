I believe in digital disruption and I do believe there is a lot that will change, but who am I telling that to my readers. I rarely blog about a blog but now Simon Waldman [started](http://www.simonwaldman.net/2008/08/14/my-new-blog-digital-disruption/) a new one entitled: &quot;[Digital Disruption](http://digitaldisruption.wordpress.com/)&quot; and it's a great read, especially because it is from inside the fense. Simon is Director of Digital Strategy and Development at the Guardian Media Group.

Just read [The Outsider Solution](http://digitaldisruption.wordpress.com/2008/08/14/the-outsider-solution-chuck-away-your-businesswrong-wrong-wrong/), or [post on the NYT](http://digitaldisruption.wordpress.com/2008/08/13/margins-dividends-topline-growth/). Having met Simon some time ago I can only suggest reading the blog. He does get it as they say, and not only from a &quot;let's go all digital&quot; point of view but from a real understanding of the newspaper business, with lots of discussions with all involved.
