This is getting really scary. Nico [posts about Cyworld](http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1588), who now have 13 million users and make something like $200.000 per day in revenue! How? People in Cyworld can buy themselves furniture and music and the like for their appartments. There is a longer article [here](http://theage.com.au/articles/2005/05/06/1115092684512.html?oneclick=true) ([bugmenot](http://bugmenot.com/view.php?url=theage.com.au)).
