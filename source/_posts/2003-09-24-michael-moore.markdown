I recently posted a [a link](http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000876.php) to a page full of things that aren't quite right in the film Bowling for Columbine. Well now I found [this article on kuro5hin.org](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/9/24/53736/8924) which talks about some of them and more. Interesting for those who were interested in the first post ;)
