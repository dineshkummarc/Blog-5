&lt;p&gt;Google has a nice little bookmarklet hidden away in the Goodies section of your Google Reader preferences. It adds a nice little link to your bookmarks bar called &quot;Next &gt;&gt;&quot;. What does it do? It opens the next unread item in your Google Reader, but not on the reader itself, but the site that the post came from, the permanent url. It's a totally different way to use your Feed Reader and a very nice one at that. And once you are done, Google gives you a very nice page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.thylmann.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/picture-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;The End of the Internet&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.: I am currently starting to wonder if they are putting ads in those &quot;Next&quot; items from time to time. I just ended up on a Dell page. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
