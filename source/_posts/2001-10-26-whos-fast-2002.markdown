Fast Company has published their new list of leaders in 2002. Check it [here](http://www.fastcompany.com/online/52/wf_intro.html). It is really an interesting read. I loved the story about [Feargal Quinn](http://www.fastcompany.com/online/52/quinn.html). The one about Michael J. Fox and his Parkinson's foundation is amazing too. These are the only ones I read so far but I will read every one of them... Again a sign that Fast Company can produce very insightful articles and interviews more often that some others.
