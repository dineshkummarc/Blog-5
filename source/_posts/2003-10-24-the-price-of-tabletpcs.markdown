A &lt;a title=&quot;Tablet PC fees hard to swallow | CNET News.com&quot; href=&quot;http://rss.com.com/2100-1005_3-5095467.html?part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=news&quot;&gt;News.com article reveals that MS is getting hefty license fees for their TabletPC Version of XP. Check this quote of Acer President Wang Chen-tang:

*&quot;The cost of a tablet PC is $200 (7,000 Taiwan dollars) more than its notebook counterpart. Of this difference, the hardware cost is only between $30 and $60. The majority of the difference comes from the OS license,&quot; said Wang. &quot;We have tried to negotiate the fee with Microsoft several times in vain. It's very regrettable.&quot; *
