This is actually a personal note to Jonathan Schwartz from Sun. He posted about thinking that [Kangaroo is Delicious](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/20041011#kangaroo_is_delicious) yesterday and I wanted to comment on that one with a short notice that Crocodile is something he has to try. Seriously, just check out [my post about trying it](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/09/crocodile_tasts.html). Sadly, I can't comment on Jonathan's blog, which I partly understand and which partly just drives me nuts. Somehow I am growing accustomed to Blogs being a two way street and I love giving feedback to some things and be it just a simple note. There should be at least some kind of contact form on the site. But please if you read this, continue blogging Jonathan, even though you can't enable comments at this time. And taste crocodile, it's even better than kangaroo!

&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: He does use Technorati or similar things to know who talks about him ;) Thanks Jonathan.
