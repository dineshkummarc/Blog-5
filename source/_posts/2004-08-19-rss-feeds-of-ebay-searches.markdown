Are you a big buyer on eBay? Are you happily using your favorite RSS reader? Then you might want to take a look at [RSSAuction](http://www.rssauction.com/) which allows you to build RSS feeds based on searches on eBay. Very cool, even though I have to admit that I _never_ bought anything at eBay yet. Maybe there is some growth left in the company ;)
