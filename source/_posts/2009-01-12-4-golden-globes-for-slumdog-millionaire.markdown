It's actually a way too short post for the blog but hey, I just read that [Slumdog Millionaire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1010048/) won 4 Golden Globes [over at The Inquisitr](http://www.inquisitr.com/15041/slumdog-millionaire-wins-four-golden-globes/) and I need to send out my congratulations.

The thing is that the movie is just plain wonderful to watch, with a great story and everything. Not a lot more to say really without giving away the story so I will leave it at this and let you watch the movie. :)
