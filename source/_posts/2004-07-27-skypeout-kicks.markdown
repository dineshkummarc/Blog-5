Yesterday I tried out [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) for real finally and I actually put some money on my SkypeOut account, allowing me to call landline phones. The quality is really very good. I do like it. Mobile phones is not something you want to be calling really but landline is very cool. I mean 1.4 cents per minute to call the USA is nice. These people will rule the world, at least partly, if they take it up the right way now. And calling Skype users is even free from PC to PC, of course. Contact me if you want my username. You can also get it if you link in via [OpenBC](http://www.openbc.com/).
