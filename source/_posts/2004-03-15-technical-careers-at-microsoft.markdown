There we go. A [Microsoft Jobblog](http://weblogs.asp.net/jobsblog/), maintained and run without constraints by none other than one of the recruiters of Microsoft. This could be the perfect things for getting people work for you. Be open and pre-qualify through your blog. Also keep people attached through RSS feeds of that blog.
