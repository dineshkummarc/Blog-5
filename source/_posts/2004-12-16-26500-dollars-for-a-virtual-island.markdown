This is actually something I talked about with friends a long time ago. Making a game like this can be amazingly rewarding financially. One step back maybe. I am talking about a game with an exchange rate towards real money and a real economy. The thing is that you will have oodles of real money in your corporate bank account from all the people that paid in money. All that internal money is virtual though. Lots of tricky thinking possible to go on there. Well now, inside the MMPORG Project Entropia, somebody bought a virtual island for $26,500, due to the fact that 10 PEDs are 1 USD. :) Of course he gets an island that is 6000 acres big, with a castle and good to hunt beasts and has full taxation right on mining and hunting and can sell parcels of the land... hmm... :) Full story here: &lt;a title=&quot;New Scientist - Virtual island sells for $26,500 in cyber assets&quot; href=&quot;http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6807&quot;&gt;New Scientist - Virtual island sells for $26,500 in cyber assets.
