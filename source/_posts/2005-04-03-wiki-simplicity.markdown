[Ross](http://ross.typepad.com/) has a [nice post](http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2005/03/enterprise_stre.html) showing the simplicity of Wikis. It's really boiled down to one image that you can show in your enterprise to make them see why Wikis are such a great idea. Sure there are other options but this image in itself is a killer.
