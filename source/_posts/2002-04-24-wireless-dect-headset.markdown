Wonderful. I just got this thing set up:

It's a portable DECT phone with a headset and costs only 50 EUR, which is far cheaper than anything else on the market. It's nice and small and seems to work like a charm.

On a related note I was at the Germany - USA ice hockey game here in Cologne yesterday. Over 18000 fans and 99% germans of course. It's interesting that when the US team came in you saw them scating around on the ice and they recited the names. Then the german team came in, spotlights, music, pictures of each player on the overhead display, the crowd roaring ;) I presume it's the same when germany plays in the US though. The cool thing is, germany won 5 to 3 and you can imagine how the crowd went wild. Intense. I think I have to go to a few more hockey games. 

The thing I have to think about now is if I should go to the US WWF show on the first of may. Not that I like wrestling but with this being the only show in germany ... it might be fun to watch the show.
