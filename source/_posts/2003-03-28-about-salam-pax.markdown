The Philadelphia Inquirer has a nice article about Salam Pax's blog. It's aspecially interesting at the moment because the blog went silent on the 24th when heavy bombing has really started in Bagdad. The rumors are flying high about whether he is dead, simply without internet access or even taken into prison by Saddam and his gang.
