TechCrunch [posts](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/14/vast-%E2%80%93-aggregating-listings-from-the-whole-web/) about [Vast](http://vast.com/) and it does look like a very interesting idea/concept/platform indeed. The cool thing is that it's a WebServices play and will add a whole new layer to the MashUps concept. I am already looking forward to seeing some interesting MashUps with Vast in play.
