Yes, yes, yes and yes. Check out [this post on Transparent Bundles](http://majestic.typepad.com/seth/2005/02/false_profits_i.html). I'll simply quote:

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://majestic.typepad.com/seth/2005/02/false_profits_i.html&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future of Internet advertising is sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Oh so true. I touched upon it [here](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/01/cpm_rss_and_the.html) and [here](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/01/internet_your_l.html). This internet thing is a city and buildings don't run on CPM advertising either, they run on sales. Portals will too. And that doesn't mean that the entire sales process happens online. Some processes might just be mapped more efficiently offline.
