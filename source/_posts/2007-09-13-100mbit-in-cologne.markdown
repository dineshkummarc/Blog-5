Damn, I am living too far outside of Cologne. [NetCologne](http://netcologne.de/) has started [CitynetCologne](http://www.citynetcologne.de/), building own their own fiber network in Cologne. Living in Esch, a little bit outside, I am not in the main build out area. What does that mean for me? I had to put in a request now to get it and it is unlikely that it will happen soon. What does that again mean for me? I do not get a 100mbit/s downstream, 10mbit/s upstream Internet Connection for the unbeatable price of â‚¬44,90!!!

This is a really wonderful product and I want to have it. Looking forward (or not) to the answer of NetCologne towards my request.

Update: I am not getting this anytime soon. But I did manage to reconfigure my line a bit to be speedier and stuff, for the same price, because I had an older contract. So all is (half) well. ActuallyÂ  6/100th well, but anyway ;)
