In the works for a long time, Nokia and Six Apart have now announced that [TypePad and LifeBlog will talk to each other](http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=/www/story/09-08-2004/0002246056&amp;EDATE=) in the future. The app will be demoed at DEMOMobile, and will enable, if I read it correctly, to blog directly from LifeBlog. Very nice indeed. Congratulations people!
