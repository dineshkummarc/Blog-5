I wanted to start this category for some time and now that I did I might as well start posting some ideas. I am a huge supporter of the mobile revolution and in that I fully agree with Russell's post on [mBoom](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1007757.html). It includes a chart on handset sales, which he took from the [TMF](http://www.fool.com/) Boards. I agree with him that the boards rock and I was a long time member, only un-signing recently because I just didn't have the time anymore. I hope to be able to join again later. Great board, great people. Anyway, I really agree with Russell. This thing is moving and I already talked about it on TMF in an article entitled [What Next for the Mobile Internet?](http://www.fool.com/portfolios/RuleMaker/2002/rulemaker020605.htm).  This thing is coming and the change will be immense.

A few things have changed since then, which include things like WLan and Voice-Over-IP which are both starting to get a foothold. I actually loved nocat, aka Wavelan, some 4 or 5 years ago and I love it now, but not as a the roaming thing that it is said to be.

Which companies do I currently have investments in? Vodafone and Nokia. I'll talk more about them in the future, for now, be sure that the mobile revolution is coming and coming with force.
