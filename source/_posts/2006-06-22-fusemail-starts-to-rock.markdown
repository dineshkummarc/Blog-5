We recently chose [Fusemail](http://www.fusemail.com/) as our email solution and it is really starting to rock. I searched for a long time for a hosted email solution as I really don't want to have to think about it and I was very happy to find Fusemail. We now have 1GB IMAP mail boxes with them. Spam filtering seems to work great and if something like spam ends up in my inbox I simply drag it to the spam folder and the system learns.

Above that I just synchronized my Contacts and Calendar via SyncML from my Nokia N70 to Fusemail and now my Contacts are shared with the rest of the team. iCal Remote integration still has a few problems but I am sure that these will be solved soon. The Webmail interface is nice for on the road and all in all I am starting to be a really happy guy here.

If you are looking for a reliable email solution, take a look. There is an Outlook Sync client for those in the windows world, but due to SyncML it also works well with non-Windows people. Here at [Ormigo](http://ormigo.com/) we now have two Windows systems, two Macs and one Linux machine, meaning that we want it to work everywhere. Fusemail does that.

Thanks also to our reseller [GID mbH](http://www.gid-mbh.de/). I can be a pain sometimes, I know ;)
