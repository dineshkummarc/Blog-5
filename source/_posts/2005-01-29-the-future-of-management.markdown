My knowledge management tutor gave us a great article from [changeX](http://www.changex.de/), a site about the change in economy and society that is currently going on. The article looks at the problem that current MBA schools don't teach managers what they need to learn in our new economy. [Tom Peters](http://www.tompeters.com/) would be proud ;) Are we building up a management elite that does:

- focus on excellent leadership instead middle of the read success?
- work by living cooperation instead of simple control?
- rely on inspiration instead of administrative instruction?
- work on knowledge creation instead of fixing routines?
- focus on understanding and looking at the context instead of simple requirements?
- are fixed on sense and meaning instead of money?

New leaders need to find the people to do something, look reality in the eye, make the focus of the company clear, create a culture of discipline and leverage technology as acceleration. This is just a list they mention and there are likely lots of different things to look at it, but the really important thing is, that you need to be different. We are moving into a knowledge economy, and from there into a values economy if a friend of mine is right. You don't get the most knowledge or the best values through control. You need understand the values bottom up and find out how to nurture them in the right way. You need to let people free under make sure they are motivated and know the rough direction to get most of their knowledge. And you need to interlink them and let them share based on the SECI Model for example. We know more than we can tell, as Polanyi said. This is important, first because specifications don't tell everything, and second because that means that all the outsourcing might be wrong or we need a different kind of outsourcing.

The thing is that you need to build a base of common understanding, shared beliefs, and you need to be able to move them beyond your corporate boundaries. Talk to the world. Our mental models aren't really equipped for it at the moment but we need to adapt. We need to learn, unlearn, relearn. Use teams small enough to have amazing cohesion and give them a guiding light, then let them run free. Suddenly we need less managers and more doers, thinkers, players, motivators. Tom Peters idea of a manager as a barrier removal consultant is a very good term. Break mental barriers, get people to understand. Don't just sell. Sell the right stuff. 

Where will the good people work in the future? Where they belong. Now go make people belong and boy can you have some power.
