After Lukas blogged it [at GrÃ¼nderszene](http://www.gruenderszene.de/?p=55), and the comments making sure everyone knows it's true with some interesting links, it is now [official](http://blog.openbc.com/2006/09/ooops.html). OpenBC will become Xing. I hope to learn a bit more about this new name soon, but for now I have to say I like it. Marketing people will surely like it because it's a lot more brandable. And the new slogan: &quot;Powering Relationships&quot; is a good one. With a new site coming soon, there are probably some interesting things to come. Looking forward to seeing them managing the name change which will surely not be easy. At least they are [already](http://blog.openbc.com/2006/09/whats_the_buzz.html) on the frontpage of Technorati with all the bloggers writing about it.

As of &lt;a xhref=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A+Xing&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&quot; mce_href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A+Xing&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&quot;&gt;Google define: Xing this is the definition:

*One of the Twelve Symbols of Sovereignty, the constellation of three stars is a symbol of the cosmic universe. The universe, as personified by the Emperor, is an unending source of pardon and love.*

Big Name :)
