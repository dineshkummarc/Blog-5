&lt;p&gt;Ok, I would so much want this. But, it's only manufactured 100 times and only in gold and platinium and as [gizmodo already noted](http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/clocks-and-watches/opus-5-039279.php) probably costs more than most of my organs combined. :) In any case, I am talking about the [Opus 5](http://www.opus5.ch/), a new kind of watch with a totally wonderful mechanism to tell the time. It's part of [Harry Winston Rare Timepieces](http://www.hwrt.ch/) and a joy to watch. You just have to love this kind of stuff, even though I mostly don't even wear a watch :)&lt;/p&gt;
