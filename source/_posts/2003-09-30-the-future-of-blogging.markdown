Very good writing here: &lt;a title=&quot;Weblogging (Spiked)&quot; href=&quot;http://www.spy.co.uk/Articles/Spiked/Weblogging/&quot;&gt;Spy: Writing: Weblogging (Spiked). The only thing I have to object to is that Bloggers need to become more like Journalists, proofing stories and things. What is needed is that a clear and coherent picture is giving of events, taking into account different view points. That might not mean that Journalistic Standards are the ultimate answer though. Maybe there is something better.
