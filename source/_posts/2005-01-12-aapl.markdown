&lt;p&gt;Ok, just bought [Apple](http://www.apple.com) [stock](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAPL). Stupid me. I am getting too excited too easily. BHAG for the cool people. I won't link to all the announcements but you will figure it out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: So much for being stupid. Analyst estimate was 49 cents. They went in at 70 cents profit per share. [wow](http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/050112/sfw092_1.html)!.
