&lt;p&gt;Now that would be a killer MacWorld announcement wouldn't it? Just imagine Apple owning Quicktime and Flash. Just imagine them owning Photoshop. Just imagine them being content creation and distribution. That's Cringely's idea in his latest article entitled: [End Game: Why Apple will buy Adobe](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2008/pulpit_20080111_003899.html).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is that Apple has $15 billion in cash (as Cringely pointed out). That is not enough for Adobe's $22 billion valuation, but they could throw in some cash. Let's say they need to pay a 20-30% premium, then they need something like $30 billion to get Adobe. A few billion in cash and the rest in stock. With Apple's valuation at $152 billion that might be doable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is that I do not currently know what else they could do that would really rock our world. Sure an ultra-thin laptop withÂ  touchscreen might be nice, but without some added things it will not change the world. IT will not lead to soo much more profit, manely because the market isn't that huge. They might do a package system with a desktop and laptop and things. I am pretty sure that they will do something great. Buying Adobe would be one possible thing.&lt;/p&gt;
