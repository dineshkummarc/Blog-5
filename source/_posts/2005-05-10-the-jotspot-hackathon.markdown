Motivated by [Atlassian's Hackathon](http://blogs.atlassian.com/rebelutionary/archives/000495.html) the fine people at JotSpot performed the [Jotspot Inagural Hackathon](http://blog.jot.com/archives/2005/05/09/jotspot-inagural-hackathon/). The idea is for coders to work on unfamiliar turf on something that can be delivered as a prototype in a day... in one day. So at the end you have presentations and a lot of creativity that would otherwise have gone unused. Very cool indeed.
