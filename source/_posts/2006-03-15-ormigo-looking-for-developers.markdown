[Ormigo](http://ormigo.com/), [our](http://www.henninglange.com/) new start-up
situated in the wonderful german city of Cologne, is looking for some people.

Ormigo is looking for some people. We are starting out with [Developers](http://www.ntk.net/ballmer/mirrors.html). We are looking for two people at the moment, but if there are three perfect fits we are not likely to decline any of them.

This is actually why I am not posting one description but a general overview about what kind of things we are looking for. You are here to grow, we grow together, and we need diversity. If you feel yourself in part of the job cloud coming along, please tell us.

**The â€œI hate HTMLï¿½? PHP Coder**

You like developing software that scales. You love it when an idea from the edge works out great. You are thorough and can take a weird idea, a rough sketch, to a beautiful, object oriented, scalable and testable code base. You are not afraid to say â€œNo, thatâ€™s not going to work.ï¿½? but will have the inner drive to make it happen anyway.

You have deep knowledge and long term experience with PHP and MySQL, especially the newest versions of those two, having understood that writing object oriented code is the way to go. You have worked  with XML/XSLT and Web Services as external services to improve your platform. You know that handling data is a finicky thing and worked with big amounts of them.

You have been working on online projects for ages and have been especially active in backend development. If you have worked in a statistics heavy performance marketing environment, advertising solutions, WebServices and billing systems we want to hear from you. Knowing about Tagging, Unit Testing, Mapping, Geocoding, ajax, RSS, Atom and all the Web 2.0 hype is a plus. If you managed teams yourself, especially external teams and developers, thatâ€™s a big plus.

What do we want from you? A short introduction letter why you think you are the person that will rock this place to new heights, a short CV and links to a few examples of what you worked on with a few lines of what exactly you did there.

What we offer? An exciting work place, building a backend of a truly scalable platform within an IT centric corporation. You will be one of the people making that happen and you will be here from the start.

**The Oversight Coder**

You like building applications and services for the web. You dig templating systems and separating code from presentation and want all of this nice and clean. Things need to scale and you want to change your presentation without changes in the backend.

You have a full understanding of PHP and MySQL and feel at home in them but also feel a turn-on thinking about CSS, XML/XSLT and ajax. Above that you are also somebody that has understood the importance of good project management and want to grow more in that respect too.

We are also accepting suggestions from people who really want to do the front end part, love HTML, ajax and css. Who are designers and coders at the same time and love having access to data to mangle around. A quality assurance guy, with PHPUnit2 experience, that wants to do a bit of hands on coding would be one of the next hires. So bring the resumes on.

You can send all this directly to [me](mailto:oliver@ormigo.com) or contact me via Skype (othylmann). Looking forward to hearing from you.
