Thanks to post on it, I just found out that [Marchex](http://www.marchex.com/) is going public. Not that I know Marchex, but as John puts it, the search engine space is hotting up and they are into search engine optimization. It all fits in wonderfully. Now they seem to be buying companies left and right. To be watched ;)
