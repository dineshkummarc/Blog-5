The Six Apart crew is getting bigger and better I have to say and am happy to see them hireing [Andrew Anker](http://aa.typepad.com/), who's posts I have been reading on [VentureBlog](http://www.ventureblog.com/) for some time now. I like it that they are trying to get real bloggers into the company, and real good ones in both work and play at that. Congratulations to both parties involved. I am happy to see you grow!
