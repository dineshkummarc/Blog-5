John Battelle just [posted about](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000734.php) Google acquireing Picasa. [Picasa](http://www.picasa.com/picasa/) is responsible for [Hello](http://www.hello.com/), the service for uploading pictures to your [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) Blog. I presume all that Google is doing now, is buying a few companies that they work with rather closely to make sure nobody else snaps them up to get inside knowledge. Hello.com is also rather big it seems, so it's a worthwhile acquisition, especially for the few millions that it likely was.
