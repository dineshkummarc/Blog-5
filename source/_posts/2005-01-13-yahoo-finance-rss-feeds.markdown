I wanted to have this, do this, for some time already and now Jeremy [posted about](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003924.html) Yahoo! Finance having [RSS feed](http://biz.yahoo.com/rss.html) of the news of companies with a ticker symbol. You can just get all the news to the stock that you have or want to have in your portfolio. Now all I want is that they also push out the new price with every news. :)

On a related note, you can also [get RSS feeds of MSN Search results](http://blogs.msdn.com/msnsearch/archive/2005/01/11/351064.aspx), both news and web. That will put them one step in front of Google News in some respects, because there I don't get RSS feeds.
