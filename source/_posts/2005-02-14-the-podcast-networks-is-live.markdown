I [recently posted](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/02/podcasting_stat.html) on podcasting statistics and there seems to be a hockey stick phenomenon going on there. Now I [read on Ensight](http://www.ensight.org/archives/2005/02/13/the-podcast-network-lives/) that the [Podcast Network](http://www.thepodcastnetwork.com/) is live and has [a blog too](http://www.thepodcastnetwork.com/tpn/). Think of it as the new radio network in the making. Very cool indeed. Good luck to all those involved. [The buzz](http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&amp;url=thepodcastnetwork.com) is already starting.
