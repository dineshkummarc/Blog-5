For all those that haven't gotten used to using RSS instead of eMail for stuff remotely similar to newsletters, like blogging, I am happy to say that I set up a bloglet that allows you to subscribe to my posts via eMail. You will find it at the right side of both this blog and the [OUBS Blog](http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/) and can choose to subscribe to either one. Subscribing will result in you getting an eMail once a day about everything that is new on these two sites. If you prefer to be updated more regularly, then subscribe to the RSS feeds via [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/). Everyone have a great weekend.
