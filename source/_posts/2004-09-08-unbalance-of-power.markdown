The next [ChangeThis](http://www.changethis.com/) Issue came into my inbox recently, and one thing I started reading swiftly was Al Gore's speach entitled [Unbalance of Power](http://www.changethis.com/3.UnbalanceOfPower). It's an interesting perspective of what is currently going wrong in the US, with war and things only being symptoms. 

*&quot;I am calso convinced that they [the founders] would warn us that democracy itself is in grave danger if we allow any president to use his role as commander in chief to rupture the careful balance between the executive, legislative and judicial branche of government.&quot;*

In relation to terrorists he adds &quot;*their overall numbers seem to have grown considerably because our invation of the country that did not pose any imminent threat to us was perceived in their part of the world as a gross injustice.*&quot;

An interest fact comes from him in relation to Abu Ghraib. He tells a story about a kid on a kind of student exchange in Spain, who called his dad asking if the stuff about what happened in the prison was correct. The father said that it's not true and that he does not know what is on the TV over there in spain, but it's not true. He later, yes later, when it finally appeared on TV in the US, that he was wrong. He couldn't be believe it. *&quot;But the fact that others around the world saw these pictures before we did is itself an issue that runs to the core of important concerns about the course of our democracy.&quot;*

Interesting read all in all.
