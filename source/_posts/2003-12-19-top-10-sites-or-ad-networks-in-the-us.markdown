The [comScore Media Metrix Top 50 U.S. Internet Property Rankings For November 2003](http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/031217/cgw053_1.html) are out and I really like the list with an ad focus, meaning that it shows the potential reach of your advertising by going to a specific site or network. Advertising.com is on spot 2 there!
