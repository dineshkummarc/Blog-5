After reading [Le Meur's post about it](http://www.u-blog.net/loic/note/57130) I just joined [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) and started trying to get some collegues and friends to join. In general, this is part of the entire social software type of applications that are starting to come up online, with [Friendster](http://www.friendster.com/) having started it all.

The interesting twist with LinkedIn, next to the cool name ;), is that it gives the entire thing a business spin, allowing business people to link to each other building their professional network. While this is a small twist it moves the entire system beyond the fun idea and into a very usable system for building your connections well into the future. I am looking forward to seeing my network grow. Join in.
