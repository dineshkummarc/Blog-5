[Ross Mayfields](http://ross.typepad.com/) new Flickr Group [Parking Lot Indicatr](http://www.flickr.com/groups/parkinglot/) has it's first victim. There seems to be something going on on a sunday at Parc (subsidiary of Xerox) as seen [in this phote](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ross/3165195/) showing that there are cars on the parking lot. The idea behind this came from Ross' uncle, who told him that to see in which company to invest, he should go look at parking lots of companies in Silicon Valley and if there are lots of cars there on a weekend, then they are pretty likely before a major new release. Looking forward to seeing more companies in there :)
