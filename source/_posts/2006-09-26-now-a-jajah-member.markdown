Ok, I couldn't resist anymore after [this post](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/26/jajah-just-launched-killer-voip-product/) on Techcrunch. It talks about the new app that [Jajah](http://www.jajah.com/) has just released which is a kind of plugin for your mobile phone, or for my Nokia N70 at least. It simply reroutes my calls via Jajah, making international calling a lot cheaper. I already have a phone flatrate but this only applies for germany. I will have to turn it off while being in Germany and calling people in Germany. But to EU countries and the USA it costs me 69 cents per minute with Base and 15 cents per minute with Jajah. Now that's nice.

Dear people of Jajah. It would be nice if I would be able to configure the plugin to where it applies. All of +49 should be off limits for the app because Base is just cheaper for me.

&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Just had a chat with [Frederik Hermann](http://www.netzkobold.com/), who is currently at DEMO in the US and Marketing Manager for Jajah. When he called it was close to 1am his. After a short chat about the people we are both connected to on OpenBC, and general talk about Jajah, he quickly explained to me how the Jajah client behaves.

The thing is that all my worries are settled. In the main settings you can set your own international prefix, 49 for me. This means that for all numbers that are +49, the Jajah plugin will not do anything. Then there is a kind of include list in the settings. This routing table holds &quot;+*&quot; and &quot;00*&quot; as default settings, meaning that it will handle all calls (ex. those with country code from your own international settings) that look like the above. Very nice indeed. So if I would just like Jajah to handle my calls to certain numbers, I could do that.

Oh the mobile carriers will get pissed at this. But Jajah seems to be developing nicely, and have their development in Israel, who seem to be doing a nice job. As I heard now the founders are not really living in the US... mainly because they don't live anywhere due to the amount of traveling to exotic countries :) Looking forward to seeing more from them.  Thanks again to Frederik for taking the time late at night, from a conference none the less.

&lt;strong&gt;Update 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Seem like Sarik Weber is going into a similar space. He is leaving OpenBC, having been their first employee, and is starting something in the mobile space around cheaper calls. See more [here.](http://www.bildungsszene.de/2006/09/27/sarik-weber-verlsst-openbc/)

Update 3: Sarik Weber [is starting](http://blog.openbc.com/2006/10/sarik_launches_.html) a company called [cellity](http://www.cellity.com/), a least cost router for your mobile phone. Registered.
