Yes, I actually did not change the subject for this one. This is the default subject that Mfop2 ([http://new.bastish.net/cgi-bin/mfop2/index.cgi)](http://new.bastish.net/cgi-bin/mfop2/index.cgi)) gives you to post your first message via e-mail. What Mfop2 does is allow you to moblog with your mobile phone. This time this is not from my phone but simply from a special e-mail to try it out. But beware of the future of mightly oliver moblogging.
