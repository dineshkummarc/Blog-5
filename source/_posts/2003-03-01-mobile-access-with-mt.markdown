I now completed a first simple step to be able to read this blog with an xHTML compliant mobile phone. Going to [mobile.php](http://www.ennead.de/blog/mobile.php) will give you a simply formated output of the last 5 posts. You will also be able to use this with [Avantgo's Consumer Service](http://www.avantgo.com/) in case you want to stay about to date about my life on the go. What I need to see is how I can get MovableType to build dynamic content, so I could do stuff like &quot;back 5 posts&quot; without needing a template for it. But I am just at the start of abusing MovableType.
