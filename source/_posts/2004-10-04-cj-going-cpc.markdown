After having done only CPA deals in recent times, Commission Junction is going back a little bit, also offering CPC deals for select advertisers and partners. While this is harder to control (due to click fraud, which is rising), it pushes the power a little bit back to the publisher because they can earn directly and do not have to send over valid traffic that doesn't convert because the advertiser's site sucks. In the end, the big publishers will brake it down to a CPM, as this is their control number and advertisers will try to pay per order if possible. But enough of my rambling.
