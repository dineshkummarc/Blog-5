There we go, the [Internet 2.0](http://www.socialtext.net/loicwiki/index.cgi?internet_2_0) conference in Paris that [Loic](http://www.loiclemeur.com/) initiated is now full and has a waiting list. No wonder if you consider the lineup and the fact that it will take place in the french Senat! I would have so much loved to go, but sadly it's on the same day as the last exam from my MBA. I could probably fly over really quickly to at least grab the party but that does seem a little bit nuts ;) I am very happy to know that two friends from Cologne are going though and I will have to make them film it or something. Congratulations to Loic for getting this going. Looking forward to being there the second time around.
