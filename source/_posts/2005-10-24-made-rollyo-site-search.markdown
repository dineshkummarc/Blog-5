[Rollyo](http://www.rollyo.com/) has updated their tools page and you can now add a Rollyo box to to your own site, so I moved out Google (even though it made some money) and added Rollyo. I am looking forward to playing a bit more with it now that it is in my face and will see if I can put together some nice search rolls.
&lt;/p&gt;
