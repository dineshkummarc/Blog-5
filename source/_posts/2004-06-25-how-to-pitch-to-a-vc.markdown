So what does a VC want answered, and answered quickly? Check out: &lt;a title=&quot;The Torturous World of Powerpoint&quot; href=&quot;http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2004/06/the_torturous_w.html&quot;&gt;Feld Thoughts: The Torturous World of Powerpoint, which includes a wonderful list of questions that a VC wants answered in a simple and easy way. This is actually inspired by the idea that Powerpoint is bad, but I like it that Brad Feld gives you a good idea of what should be in a powerpoint, leaving the reader to adapt this on how best to present the answers. good read and interesting to see what's on a VC's mind.
