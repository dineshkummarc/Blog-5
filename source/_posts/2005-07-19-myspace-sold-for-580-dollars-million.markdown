So there we go. Nico just reported that [MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/) has been sold for $580 Million to Mr. Murdoch!!! His german post is [here](http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1897) and the Marketwatch article he links to is [here](http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B78E696F2%2D6DBB%2D4E82%2DA971%2DD0CCE39DA048%7D&amp;dist=rss&amp;siteid=mktw). Nice price. Actually fits to my view on [what Six Apart might be worth](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/01/yahoo_to_acquir.html).
