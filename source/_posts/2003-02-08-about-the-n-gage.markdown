The [N-Gage](//www.n-gage.com/) site is up and running for everyone to take a look at. Greg Costikyan seems to be a consultant for Nokia (he also writes for the games section of [Forum Nokia](http://www.forum.nokia.com/)) and has put up an interesting comparison. [GBA Versus N-Gage](http://www.costik.com/weblog/2003_02_01_blogchive.html#90289294). If you are interested in gaming and wireless, I suggest you take a look at [his site](http://www.costik.com/).
