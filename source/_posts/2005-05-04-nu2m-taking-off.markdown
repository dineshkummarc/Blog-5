[Nico](http://www.lumma.de/) is really taking [New Media Management](http://nu2m.de/) for a spin. He now [announced](http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1575) a new project: [ich-flieg-billig.de](http://ich-flieg-billig.de/) (i-fly-cheap). This goes in line with things like [weg.de](http://weg.de/) and [pkw.de](http://pkw.de/). Really great services delivered by a seemingly great group of people. Congratulations!
