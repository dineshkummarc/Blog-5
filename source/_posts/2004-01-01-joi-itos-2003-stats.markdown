Joi Ito posted [his site stats](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/01/01/some_2003_site_stats.html) for 2003 on his blog. I wouldn't have mentioned it if it were not for the fact that only 21% of his visitors use IE to access his site. Most use a RSS reader. Shows that RSS might really change some things in how the net works and acts and might pose some problems to the dominance of IE.
