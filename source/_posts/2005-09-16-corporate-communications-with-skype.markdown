Skype today [announced](http://share.skype.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=197&amp;Itemid=69) something they call [Skype Groups](http://www.skype.com/products/skypegroups/). What this means is that a corporation can fill up the Skype balance of their employees from one spot and keep and eye on who is using how much of their time. SkypeOut, SkypeIn and Voicemail is of course a part of it. Nice.
