I am currently looking a bit closer at [PhpAdsNew 2.0](http://www.phpadsnew.com/) to run banners ads and there are some interesting thing in development there. For one, they are looking at adding a [post-click conversion tracking](http://forum.phpadsnew.com/index.php?showtopic=4006) mechanism and it seems the PAN should see some good [imprevements in speed](http://forum.phpadsnew.com/index.php?showtopic=3810) in 2.1 which is said to come in a few months time.
