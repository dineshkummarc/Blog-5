[This post](http://poductivity.blogspot.com/2005/09/why-ebay-bought-skype.html) by David Gibbons is actually giving you a very good idea on why eBay bought Skype. With Skype Voice Services, Skype even does billing or so it seems, and hence they have another playing field. 

Where I agree with some people though, is that with the eBay API and the Skype API, a lot of things could have been built without the companies joining... there are actually some things in my head for some time already related to the company I am currently founding. :)
