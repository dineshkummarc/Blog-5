Ok, Yahoo! is getting scary. They now bought Flickr, which was rumored for some time but now is [public](http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2005/03/yahoo_actually_.html). Technorati is already [lighting up](http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&amp;url=yahoo+flickr) and this will surely be the talk of the day. First rumors I heard are around $40 million on very light revenue but I will likely change this around when I have the time to read more.

All in all I will have to see if I should not invest in [YHOO](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=YHOO&amp;t=2y). They bought Oddpost, my then eMail client, and then opened up their entire search system via an API. They going full force on blogging and now bought Flickr. If anything, they are getting cool for the hip and that means the hip go to Yahoo! and that means Yahoo! will possibly do good. More thinking needed but Yahoo! is starting to be one cool company looking at this from this side.
