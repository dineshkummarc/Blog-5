I'd like to make some comments to [Loic le Meur's speech on Building a Europe for Business](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2004/05/video_clip_of_m.html). 

I wouldn't be studying for an MBA if I didn't believe that Business is a very important thing. Founding a company is not easy, and it is full of risk and as Loic le Meur says (check the feed from his speech [here](http://clients.world-television.com/worldeconomicforum_warsaw/_S12078.asp).) taking risks needs to be made something that is seen as positive. Another idea might be to add some kind of security net to company founders. You might be able to link that to a given education that a company founder needs to have, linking in with Loic's focus on education. Well done Loic, even though it was way too short. You touched on many different subjects, potentially too many to keep in the head easily. This needs real discussion. This is important. 

As said, there are two options to deal with risk, one being reducing the risk, another making it more desireable. Reducing it would be easier I believe. Making it more desireable would mean makeing us worse off really in our daily life which would be hard. Another option to make the potential payoff so big, that the risk becomes more desireable. Worth more thinking.
