I just [found out](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000342.php) that [Vivisimo is searching eBay](http://vivisimo.com/ebay) via the eBay API none the less. I am starting to really like Vivisimo I have to say. I mean just search for [Nokia 6600](http://test.vivisimo.com/search?query=Nokia+6600&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;timeout=14000&amp;form=simple-eBay&amp;v%3Asources=eBay&amp;v%3Aproject=eBay&amp;sacategory=0) in all categories and you have that nice browsable list on the left side that lets you dig down deeper.  This fits wonderfully with [Tim Bray's articles on Search](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/02/tim_bray_on_sea.html) which also mentioned that most people do not really use more than one word in their searches. You then need to give them the option to easily go deeper into the search results. I am starting to wonder if Vivisimo could become a threat for Google. We'll see. If I were to look for a search engine for an intranet, I'd seriously consider Vivisimo as an option.
