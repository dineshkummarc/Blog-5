I just found out via [Heiko's post](http://www.hebig.com/archives/002858.shtml) that About.com has been bought for $410 million by the NYT! With About.com being published with MovableType, NYT now has one of the biggest blogging installations out there. Paidcontent.org has [more](http://www.paidcontent.org/pc/arch/2005_02_17.shtml#012387).
