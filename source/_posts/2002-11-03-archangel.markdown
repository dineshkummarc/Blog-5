I just finished Robert Harris' Archangel, a book that thijs gave me some time ago. I have to admit, that it is fairly good. The story is well layed out, the characters are good and in general the story is very deep. I didn't want to put down the book at the end which is good. I just don't know how true the history is in the book. Then again, if it were, it would not be too important as I'm not able to remember all this stuff anyway. If it isn't, then it's a great story in itself. So all in all. The book makes you think a lot too, about russia and the way it's history is shaping its future and also the current way of living in the country.
