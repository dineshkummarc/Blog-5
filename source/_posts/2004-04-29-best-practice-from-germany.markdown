[Loic le Meur](http://www.loiclemeur.com/) is asking for some [suggestions for the Planetary Session on building a Europe for Business](http://wef.typepad.com/blog/2004/04/help_me_for_the.html) at the WEF. He actually has some examples for some countries but I am missing something for Germany. What is the best practice we could carry on into Europe. Were is out success? I think there are many, and the biggest successes are normally the smaller ones, but what is there to talk about. Again, a real problem seems to be, at least to me, that we aren't likely to brag a lot. We should. We just don't. Give your comments on the [WEF Blog Post](http://wef.typepad.com/blog/2004/04/help_me_for_the.html).
