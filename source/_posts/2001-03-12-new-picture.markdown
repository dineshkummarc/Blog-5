Ahhh... I finally found a picture that is not 3 years old. This one is from 2 articles I have written for clickz.com. They can be found [here](http://clickz.com/article/cz.2204.html) and [here](http://clickz.com/article/cz.2233.html).

I actually went further with scripting which is really  cool. I now have a backup happeneing and mails sent to be once a day to tell me how big the directory is and how much space is left on the drive.

The one I just wrote will send me an sms message when the database crashes and I need to take a backup and copy that over. Doing that automatically is a bit too risky in my mind until I see that the system is fully working. I am not sure yet, the if statement is kind of a hack :)

Next thing will be a password protected wap page that will let me perform the required operations to get the database back online :)

This is fun. And I just started converting my homepage, which barely exists, so it is a good time, to php. Learning php is fun I have to say. Once all our domains are updated then I will go working some more with MySQL too. Woohooo... turning coder again on my old age :)
