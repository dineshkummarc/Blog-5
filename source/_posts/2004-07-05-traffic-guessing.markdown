Slashdot [reported](http://science.slashdot.org/science/04/07/03/0245255.shtml?tid=134&amp;tid=185) that a german university has built a system that forecasts traffic conditions on the german autobahn and it seems to be very good at that. With a certainty of 86%, there will be slowed traffic on the ring around Cologne in about 60 minutes from now. 

You can check traffic forecasts [here](http://www.autobahn.nrw.de/olsim2_5/index_main_d.html). [This here is for Cologne](http://www.autobahn.nrw.de/olsim2_5/koeln60.html). Very cool.
