Business Networking wrote a post showing (via Alexa, so it's not 100% certain) that OpenBC is bigger than LinkedIn, at least in terms of reach. I think their focus is another one and actually LinkedIn seems more focussed but all in all, the OpenBC model is the growth model and they are making money. So if I had to bet on someone, I'd bet on OpenBC to come out as the winner. But my linking quality feels higher in LinkedIn. They both have their market and will likely exist next to each other, even though I'd have nothing against them buying each other so I only have one site to use ;)

See the post here: &lt;a title=&quot;openBC, LinkedIn and Alexa - Why openBC Part II&quot; href=&quot;http://biznetworking.blogspot.com/2005/07/openbc-linkedin-and-alexa-why-openbc.html&quot;&gt;Business Networking: openBC, LinkedIn and Alexa - Why openBC Part II&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: As said twice in the comments and via eMail, the Alexa Data is irrelevant because a lot of their traffic comes in via https, which is not tracked via Alexa. LinkedIn is likely bigger in a world wide basis, but OpenBC bigger in Germany at least (based on my experience with the german network at least). Let's see how the games continue. :)
