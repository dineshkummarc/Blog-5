Finally we have good weather. It is getting warm in Germany and I like it. Already got a new haircut and finally made the move. I bought [new glasses](http://www.oakley.com/cda/3.0/1,1676,49-MA1-1-8-30,00.html). Oakley a Wire thick, with black prescription glasses. God these prescription glasses make these things expensive. But Oakley are the only ones that can give you glasses with the same looks as without prescription. Otherwise you would get these weird brown or green colors only. Sadly it will not take 4 weeks for the set to arrive. The good weather will probably be over by then ;)

php coding is getting more fun I have to say. Once you get the hang of it you see what can be done and I might even start liking coding :) It is a real good stretch for the brain and the perfect counter ballance to the MBA studies, where I have to think about communicating with people at the moment and how the same event is interpreted differently by different people. Nothing ground braking really but I presume that this is exactly the problem for the later test. I just think it is easy but it isn't. I will see what the others think, whom I will be meeting again this Saturday in Brussels.
