I had the exact same idea [as Anil de Mello](http://www.admpartners.com/archives/2003/11/000225.html) in relation to using Nokia's digital pen together with a Bluetooth/MMS Phone to blog textnotes. Actually, I am simply wondering about the power of this pen in general, because I am looking at getting the 6600 from Nokia and ditching the Palm. I might need some extra input method to be a little bit more flexible when taking notes.

The only problem I don't like with this pen is that you need digital paper and you can't do without it. So you can't just take the pen, but you need to also take the paper with you to use it. On top of that, a problem with Anil's idea is that you would need handwriting recognition at least for the e-mail address, which is currently not there. 

I would be able to use the pen as a method of enhancing presentations though. Still to be found out though is whether it really only syncs with USB and not via Bluetooth with a PC, which Nokia says is how it works. Bluetooth only seems to work to a mobile phone, which sounds a bit weird.
