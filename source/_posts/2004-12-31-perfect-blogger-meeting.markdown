It took some time for me to pick this up but Heiko's post about the [Tropical Islands](http://www.thetropical-islands.com/) near Berlin could be the perfect blogger meeting point. I mean you can go swim, sit on the beach, or have a beach party. And on top of that you have free Wi-Fi!!! The only problem is that there are no hotels in the place, which means you have to leave the place. With this drawback the idea doesn't sound so wonderful anymore, even though good weather would be certain. So people to The Tropical Island, please put a hotel in the place :)
