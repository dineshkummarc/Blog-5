For the US people among you, AT&amp;T recently launched mMode which is similar to i-mode, which again, came from NTT DoCoMo, who have invested in AT&amp;T Wireless. They have also invested in KPN. KPN own e-plus. Now e-plus launched i-mode. Now I am getting the phone for a month to test it. Wopiiiii ;) Sadly I can only spend 50 EUR and anything above that I have to pay for myself. Would have liked it unlimited. Ah well, I can only keep it a month anyway ;)
