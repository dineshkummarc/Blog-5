ResearchBuzz just [posted a story](http://www.researchbuzz.org/archives/002203.shtml) that Google made some changed to their [Site-Flavored Search](http://www.google.com/services/siteflavored.html) system. The idea is that you can tell Google what your site is about and then put a search box on your site. People that search via it will then be giving more fitting sites to what your site is about, and what your readers interest potentially is. That in itself is interest.&amp;nbsp; The cool thing is that you can let Google [scan your page](http://labs.google.com/personalized/siteflavored) and they will tell you which categories they think will fit. I did for this blog. As a reminder, at the moment there are stories about: Dan Gllmor, iPods, Power Wichteln, The one minute manager, Eddie Lampert and Warren Buffett, Froogle, Clickbots, Click fraud, Copenhagen and Casinos on here. Google decided that my blog was about Religion. :)

Good that this thing is still in the [Google Labs](http://labs.google.com/), but I would have thought it will get buisness/finance, computers, or something similar. Maybe I should just accept that I am writing about religion ;)

**Update**: Check out [Google Suggest](http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1) which gives you suggestions to keywords as you type ([source](http://www.agenturblog.de/archives/2004/12/google_suggest.php)).
