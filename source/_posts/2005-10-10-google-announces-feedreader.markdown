Google has opened their [FeedReader](http://www.google.com/reader/things/intro) to the public and [comments are coming in](http://google.blognewschannel.com/index.php/archives/2005/10/08/reaction-to-google-reader/). I tried it out and it is very nice, but I am not leaving [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/) just yet, mostly for one simple feature, being able to group feeds into folders, easily reading the folders instead of one feed. I have groups for people, tech news, and other things, which allows me to easy and swiftly skim through the 150 feeds I am not subscribed to. In Google's Reader I need to read them one by one.
