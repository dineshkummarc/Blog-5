See... I am already starting. If you are really into sound, then this article:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58447-2001Jun12.html

will be a nice read.

Actually even if you are not it will make you wonder. But I promise you, they are right. I would currently not spend $150.000 for a hi-fi system, but I remember something from when I bought my first one.

I have Sony CD player and Cassette player (bad boy, bad boy! :)) and B&amp;W speakers. The main driver is a hand made Aura Evolution amp from england which just rocks. Power button, volume control, switch for CD, Cassette, Phono,... It really rocks. I loved it when I bought it and it was just the right price for me several years back.

But I went into the backroom of the place where I bought it and put my Living Colour CD into the main system they had there.

IT IS LIKE THEY SAY IN THE ARTICLE!!! You suddenly feel like the band is in the room. I heard a lot (and I mean a lot) of new sounds, effects, notes, whatever inside the song I just listened to on my system in the other room. It is totally amazing. Then again, that system cost about $30.000, so it was way out of my league, but read the article and you will understand.

These things are wild. Now I listen to MP3s mostly as it is easier to just mix a lot of different thigns but if I really want to listen to something deeply, I still need a CD even if it is not the same thing as an old vinyl LP.
