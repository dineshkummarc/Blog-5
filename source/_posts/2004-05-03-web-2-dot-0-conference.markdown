Now [Web 2.0 Con](http://web2con.com/) looks like a conference to be at really. My brain would probably go to overload mode with all the information floating around the place. I'd love to be there.  Now I just need an argument on why to go in relation of my current job ;) ([source](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000635.php))
