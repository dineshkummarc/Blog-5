Greetings everyone. [WebMontag in Cologne](http://www.webmontag.de/doku.php?id=koeln) is starting to shape up nicely. We already have [Nico](http://lumma.de/) presenting [Mabber](http://mabber.com/), Igor presenting Safe RSS and Tomas going for Accessibility in a Web 2.0 world. These three alone can turn out nicely and I am looking forward to more suggestions. The list is slowly filling up with Agency people, entrepreneurs and even Business Angels. Looking forward to seeing you there too.
