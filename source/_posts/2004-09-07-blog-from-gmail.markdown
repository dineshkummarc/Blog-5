You can now use your GMail Account as your Blog storage, actually as your blogging engine. :)

[Gallina](http://ion.gluch.org.mx/files/Hacks/gallina/) is a tool that uses XML/XSLT to extract data out of your GMail account and it will use your mails as posts and conversations as comments. I haven't looked into it any deeper, but it's a very nice general idea. :)
