It's beautiful weather here and we just went for a walk in a park nearby after setting out on the balcony with our feet on the table and reading. The walk was wonderful and refreshing and it's nice to see the park slowly getting full again. There is even a swan breeding with the mail watching that nobody was getting too close. 

The most unusual thing, for that park, was a big group of sheep though and there was one of them where we were just not sure if it was the result from an out of the ordinary mating ritual between a sheep and the watch dog. :) Meet Eric the Sheeg.

While I am at it, more photos, from my holiday in Egypt and some more pics that I just think are good can be found [here](http://homepage.mac.com/bizkiffer/) (password: friends).
