After having read [this](http://www.43folders.com/2005/06/mail_acton_invo.html) I installed [Mail Act-On](http://www.indev.ca/MailActOn.html) and I love it. After using GMail for some time I love the way of just archiving mails, not having folders and just using search to find stuff. So I now have an Archive folder and just click &quot;#Ã„&quot; and boom, the mail that is currently selected is archived. Great!
