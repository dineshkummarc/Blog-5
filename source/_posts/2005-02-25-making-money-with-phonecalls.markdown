I have a server hosted at a german hosting provider called Server4you. They give me a virtual unix system for â‚¬10 a month. I thought about moving from time to time but haven't found anything else yet. Now they are upgrading the system and the thing is down and I needed to call their support number again... â‚¬1.89 per minute! And from what I gather from the accent, this thing is even situation somewhere in bulgaria or something, which would be efficient and boy are they likely making money with it! Congrats ... to you, not me. :)

This made me look at Skype rates again though and you know what. I can call almost anything world wide for â‚¬0.017! That is cheaper than my ISDN installation at home via Net Cologne! FOR CALLS IN GERMANY! 'Nuff said. Skype rocks, period, end of story. Now with the answering machine, I can pretty much ditch a real phone, just taking a mobile phone with me and have Skype. I'd love to invest in Skype, even though I still don't know if there isn't more power in SIP based systems. But it does make me happy with my Vodafone and Nokia investment. Why? Because people will more and more move to Mobile Phone and VoIP ... they will ... trust me ... it is only a question of time. Kick ass!
