Okok, that's overdoing it a little bit. RSS won't kill blogging, it might even make it more interesting. This has come to my mind with the recent problems on what I could be blogging today. The thing is, someone already wrote something about some happening somewhere I, and possibly you, might be interested in. And with RSS, it's even likely that you're reading their blogs! While I don't read Slashdot regularly, I wonder over from time to time (Important Note: Ignore the comments! ;)) and today I found that [Apple seems to have sold a 1566 dual CPU 1U XServe cluster](http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/06/22/0222210&amp;mode=nested&amp;tid=137&amp;tid=179&amp;tid=185&amp;tid=190)! Now that's a nice group of servers. Still wondering what I should do with some leftover GMail invites, I read [Heiko's GMail story](http://www.hebig.com/archives/002236.shtml) and can only agree with him. The idea of artificial shortage that Google is creating in relation to GMail, makes the service so much more interesting. On top of that, I can never stop suggesting to read [Beyond Bullets](http://sociablemedia.typepad.com/beyond_bullets/), with two recent posts being amazing again: [Gridlock Vision](http://sociablemedia.typepad.com/beyond_bullets/2004/06/fading_to_black.html) and your [Visual Bio](http://sociablemedia.typepad.com/beyond_bullets/2004/06/your_visual_bio.html), which is something I have to try (next to finally going to a Toastmasters event). 

But if you have been listening to me you are likely already checking out what Heiko has to say as well as Beyond Bullets. So I shouldn't have posted all this, and didn't add any real value. Tough luck! :)
