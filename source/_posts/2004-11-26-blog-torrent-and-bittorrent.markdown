&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I [installed](http://bt.thylmann.net) [Blog Torrent](http://blogtorrent.com/) and now I don't know what to do with it. The thing is that this system is not server based. I create a torrent on my desktop and then upload the torrent but need to stay online for it to seed. At the moment there is only a windows version for the client side but a linux and mac version are sure to come. Then I might use it some more, for now be free to use [bt.thylmann.net](http://bt.thylmann.net) as a trial system. Everyone can create accounts and upload things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this actually got me thinking again about Bittorrent. What if we create a bittorrent like system with a bit of Akamai in it. I mean a server based system that seeds large files in the network. This in itself isn't too wonderful but what if you could also publish your bandwidth cap saying for example that you have 10GB of bandwidth per month on your server and you have 8 set aside for your Bittorrent. When everyone says that everyone can more efficiently use all their bandwidth. I doubt it would work for images within a page due to latency but for files like videos, pdf, etc. there might be a real use there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem I see at the moment in installing this system on my server would be that it could blow my bandwidth allowance out of the water within a few hours if it maxes out the connection. So all we need is a bittorrent like system, server based, with meta data on bandwidth allowed, used, limited or something like that. Then I can post a file to my network or even the network and it will be picked up. Add to that some geo targetting or bandwidth monitoring or both and I will be served the file from the nearest server(s). Maybe a little JavaApp might allow the system to not require an application on the user side. Ideas over ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
