Now how cool is that! It seems that when you [search for miserable failure](http://www.google.com/search?q=miserable+failure&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8) on Google, you get [this page](http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/gwbbio.html), the homepage of [miserable failure](http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/gwbbio.html). This is actually a project of Blah3 and you can find more info [here](http://www.amon-hen.com/index.cgi/Politics/Miserable_Failure). Simple refer to the above page with the link [miserable failure](http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/gwbbio.html) on your site and eventually Google will rank it very highly indeed for that term. Google Pagerank rocks :)
