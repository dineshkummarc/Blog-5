I am actually starting to feel a little stupid here talking about this again but now the tickets have arrived. :) We are by now 10 people and I would not have thought that so many people in my vincinity want to go to a Living Colour concert. This will be a great amount of fun. Another month and I should hold the CD in my hand.
