The eMail Wars are hotting up. The German eMail Provider GMX has updated their accounts. FreeMail has 5 GB and ProMail, for 4,99 EURs per month has 10 GB!!! This includes storage space for pictures. Give it another few weeks and I can just sell my harddisk ;) ([source](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/49994))
