[Here](http://home.attbi.com/~bernhard36/honda-ad.html) you can find an amazing Honda ad. The great thing is that this happened as shown and is not computer animated which makes it double cool. I have to give it to Honda and the ad agency. This one is truely showing style and likely building a brand: &quot;Isn't it great if things just work?&quot;
