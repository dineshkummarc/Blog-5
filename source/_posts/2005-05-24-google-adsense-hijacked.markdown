Fun indeed. It seems that Google AdSense has been hijacked in the search engine results. More about this right on jensense.com: &lt;a title=&quot;Google AdSense site hijacked in the Google serps... oh the irony - JenSense.com&quot; href=&quot;http://www.jensense.com/archives/2005/05/google_adsense_4.html&quot;&gt;Google AdSense site hijacked in the Google serps... oh the irony - JenSense.com&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: Some updated info [here](http://www.jensense.com/archives/2005/05/adsense_hijack.html). Seems like the guy on number 1 didn't even try doing it. It was all just an accident.
