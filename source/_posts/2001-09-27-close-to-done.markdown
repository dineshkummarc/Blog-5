We are getting close to done here. One of the old places is almost empty and clean. My legs and arms and back and essentially the entire body feels that it _needs_ to be over though. I will be so glad when the move will really be done.


And I just read a positive message on the terrorist attacks:

&lt;I&gt;Out of potentially 74,280 Americans directly targeted by these inept cowards, 93% survived or avoided the attacks. That's a higher survival rate than heart attacks, breast cancer, kidney transplants and liver transplants -  all common, survivable illnesses.  The Hijacked planes were mostly empty, the Pentagon was hit at it's strongest point, the overwhelming majority of people in the World Trade Center buildings escaped, and a handful of passengers gave the ultimate sacrifice to save even more lives.&lt;/I&gt;

93% is amazingly high really.
