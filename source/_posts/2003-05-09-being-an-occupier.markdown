Interestingly, the United States and Britain have now said that they are occupying powers of Irak. While this is interesting at first, it gets even more interesting after reading &lt;a title=&quot;statesman.com&quot; href=&quot;http://www.statesman.com/news/content/coxnet/iraq/ap_story.html/Intl/AP.V7987.AP-Iraq-Occupying-.html&quot;&gt;this on statesman.com&lt;/a&gt;. It might even be a good idea that they called themselves and occupying power.
