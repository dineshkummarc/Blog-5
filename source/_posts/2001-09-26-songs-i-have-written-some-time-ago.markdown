A move can be fun. I just found some old pieces of paper with song texts on them that I have written while still in a band. I think it was some time at the end of school or soon after. It's fun reading them now. I think I had some kind of crisis finding out who I am ;)





Both written some time 1995-97

Watch Out

Your whole life seems to turn around a might
when you realise, there is no try
there's nothing more than do or don't
is this what you really want

Waking up early when darkness turns to light
going to sleep too late at night
when coffee becomes your source of life
is this really waht you want to do

But you gotta be careful now, if you don'T know where you're going you gotta be careful now
But you gotte be careful now, if you don't know where you're going you gotta be careful now
because you might not get there
if you don't watch out it might be too late

It is always neat to learn new things
you're taught and maybe even apprehend
extending your horizon always further
could this be what you want to do

What you should always keep in mind is
not to lose your horizon out of sight
when the directions wrong you start to doubt
is this really what you want to do with my life

Ref

Is there nothing more, is there nothing larger
is there nowhere else I can possibly go
Is there not the slightest hindering feeling
trying to break loose, is this the whole truth

Finding your way is the hardest thing to do
seldom is it clear in front of you
more a momentary clearness of mind
this is what you'll want to do

once you've found what you're looking for
don't loose it out of sigh
or you once again start to wonder
is this really what you want

Oliver (title given by Chriggy, the singer, I think)

Walking lonely, driving slow,
I don't know where to go

Bewildered feelings, encrusted cries,
when will I find the place I die

Questions too deep for arms to reach,
through perfect light still cannot see

Tunneling through cries and stones
it seems so worth to be alone

Warm inside us cold surroundings
scared to wander much to far

The things you slowly start to see
can make you feel reality

That's the thing that you fear
to see yourself as glass so clear

It is so hard to more than glare
adapt to darkness and start to stare
