I just changed the bank account linked to my mobile phone contract and about 2 hours after I sent the fax about the change I got a nice SMS from the T-Mobile Customer Service saying that all is changed. That _is_ very nice I have to say. It shouldn't, it should be standard, but it isn't and hence it is ;)
