Yesterday we went to the [Linus Talentprobe](http://www.linus-talentprobe.de/) (translated it would mean something like Linus' Tallentshow) with some friends and it was a blast. It was the first show of this summer and marked 30 years of the Talentprobe. To really get an idea you have to be there but in short, this is probably one of the toughest tallentshows out there. You can send in your tape and they might let you perform. You will then try to impress a crowd of over 8000 people, a crowd that is very hard to impress. You have to be very good to impress this crowd, which everybody who performs knows. If you are just a little bit bad, everybody will shout and scream, the crowd will sing a different song, everybody will sit down and then, from the front, get up to perform a wave, or everybody turns around and parties in the other direction. At the end, the winner is found based on applaus. Always exciting, if you are not on stage that is.
