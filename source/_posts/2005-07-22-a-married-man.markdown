I no longer have a girl friend. I now have a wife :) Feels very good actually and we had a great day so far, which was really just the legal part. Tomorrow we will have the church part of the deal with a lot more guests to celebrate with in the evening. Packing up a  few things, trying to relax. But life feels very good at the moment :)

We actually were married by Mr. Stommel, who is something of a famous guy at the registry office in cologne. It was a real joy and we had lots of laughs, which made the entire ceremony unforgettable. He had to make a joke about me being born in DÃ¼sseldorf (there is a bit of a fun war between dÃ¼sseldorf and cologne) to start with, of course topping it off with Avonia being born in the Iran (her father was there at the time). We came out of there feeling really good about all the marriage, later learning that he is married the fourth time and at the christening of his children he dresses them up for cologne karneval so they become good cologne citizen :) The guy is really fun and we thank him for a great ceremony. Oh, of course we're still feeling great about the marriage. It's a fun feeling.

We then had a quick drink outside which [Ingmar](http://bornholz.typepad.com/) prepared (thank you!) and later lunch with all (only family and best &lt;I&gt;men/women/...&lt;/I&gt;) the people that attended. With all that finished, Avonia and me are now relaxing a bit and preparing for the church tomorrow, but more on that later. For now, I am looking at my new ring again and need to give Avonia a few more kisses. :)
