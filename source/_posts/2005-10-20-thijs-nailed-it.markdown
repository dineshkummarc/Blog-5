On Sunday, Thijs posted about his view that Apple &lt;a title=&quot;And again...&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.taospace.com/2005/10/and_again.html&quot;&gt;might release a pro photo app and what do we have? [Aperture](http://www.apple.com/de/aperture/). Congratulations Thijs on the good catch. The only problem is that it costs $499!!! Ok, I can see that you a pro will pay that, but sadly $500 is too much for my taste. Then again, I can't run it anyway as I just have the bare minimum system requirements. ooook. And I think 5GB of disk space for application, templates and tutorials is A LOT.
