We actually talked about this at our blogger meeting in DÃ¼sseldorf yesterday, and it's an interesting question. Do you post when you go out to a party, leaving your home empty? Do you post about going on a business trip, leaving your family alone. What kind of post could make live more unsecure? 

This was already on my mind when I read Russell's posts about a phone threat towards his kid. Now this is deep and I really like it how Russel handels it. Start by reading his [message about the phone call](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1006673.html) and then continue reading his [Overreaction](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1006697.html) post, which goes a bit into the bigger picture of trying to keep life normal as most people are actually still nice out there. Thanks for the post Russell and good luck getting this sorted out swiftly.
