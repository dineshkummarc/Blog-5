I just found it [on GrÃ¼nderraum](http://gruenderraum.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=24). The entire thing was student project in 2004 and they have the patents it seems and are now looking for a producer. But what did they do?

It is very simple, and has nothing to do with the Web... well not at first sight. They developed a Coaster that has a pressure sensor in it and through this sensor and wireless technology it can alert the bar that your beer is empty. :) Right on! Above that you can put some features into them of course. Let's hope it takes off.
