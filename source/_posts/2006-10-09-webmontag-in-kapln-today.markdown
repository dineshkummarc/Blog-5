Another WebMontag is happening today in Cologne. You can see who is coming [here](http://www.webmontag.de/doku.php?id=koeln_6). Own own [Dirk](http://olbertz.de) will present his ideas on an Open Social Network based on FOAF. Looking forward to seeing you there.

Otherwise the list is filling nicely and I am looking forward to some good discussions. If you are a freelancer with cakePHP, CSS, Ajax, or similar knowledge I will look forward to talking to you.

See you there.
