&lt;p&gt;This post from This is going to be BIG! right [here](http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/2007/04/top_ten_reasons.html) and there are many very valid points. Let me put some down here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The thinking, not just the building, has gotten small and lightweight&lt;/strong&gt;...Â  Too many people buildingÂ  features, not applications, or, gasp, companies.Â  People are confusing design with innovation.&lt;strong&gt;Â &lt;/strong&gt; Just because you add AJAX and rounded boxes to something does mean you have innovated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are seeing a lot of this out there at the moment, just thing of all the copy cats. The thing is that you can now build stuff very fast and it might even be taken up very fast. But is it a company? We are putting a lot of effort into building a company here at Ormigo. Among others, this means we hired the right group of people that have experience in leading teams and are happy enough to do the base work now. There are some very cool companies out there, but also a lot of featuritis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web 2.0 is a conversational vacuum. &lt;/strong&gt; I'll prove it.Â  Unless you live in the Valley, walk outside your door and try to find a Twitter user... You've got six hours.Â  Go.Â  Trust me, we're talking to ourselves.Â  (Don't get me wrong...Â  I really like Twitter...Â  We just need to remind ourselves about how close to the edge we all are out here.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! Thank you! We are our own echo chamber. It was the blogging world now it's the startup world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of powerful people don't participate.Â  &lt;/strong&gt;How many VC's out there fund widget companies without having a blog or a MySpace profile?Â  Any Sony bloggers out there?Â  What about brand managers that want to do Second Life campaigns without ever having been inside.Â  How about my elected representatives?Â  They get out there and kiss babies during election time, but how many blogging elected officials are there?Â  (And not watered down campaign blogs... actual blogs written by the actual people.)Â  We could do great things if we weren't so segregated into a small group of people punch drunk on Kool Aid and a great deal of people who've never even heard of Kool Aid.&lt;strong&gt;Â &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is getting there I have to say here. We have real people blogging, more and more, but it's not an easy concept to grasp. It will make the world a better place in the long run, forcing companies to be open. But I have been saying this for a long time. The good thing about this Internet thing getting into the mainstream is that you can not as easily fake it anymore. And it will get harder.&lt;/p&gt;
