[OpenBC](http://openbc.com/) is getting Tags. It's still a few days until the feature is unveiled to all OpenBC users, but I have been playing with it a bit now and I do really like it. In each profile and in the list of your contacts, you can simply add tags via an in-place-editing field, getting suggestions based on tags you have already given. I am currently looking into some categorization scheme for myself with this.

I already have &quot;met:&quot; as a category for where I have met somebody. Obviously it is also very easy to add something like &quot;hire&quot; to mark potential new employees. At the moment it seems to be limited on tagging your contacts, but that might be extended later.

It's great to see OpenBC moving in the right direction and slowly but surely increasing the usability of their platform in the, in my mind, right direction.

Now I want a SyncML system to synchronize all my contacts, keeping those not in OpenBC private, and updating the other contact data with the data in OpenBC... even though I have to admit that I might want my own contact data from time to time. Not an easy task to settle, but might turn out to be very interesting if done right. I have high hopes.
