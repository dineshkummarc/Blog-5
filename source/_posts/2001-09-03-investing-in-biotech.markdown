Some time ago I started thinking about the great potential in Biotech. I just do not know enough about this to pick one or even a few companies. I would possibly go for Human Genome Sciences but that just includes a lot of risk. So I have been looking around for a fund with a pharma / biotech focus to invest in.

It's Pharma/wHealth by Sal Oppenheim:

It's been the best fund for both a 3 and 5 year period and place 4 in a one year period in the sector.

The thing that interested me most about this one is though that it is not only managed by Sal Oppenheim, but they manage it together with a group of several pharma/biotech consulting companies. 

I'll be putting in a fixed amount per month now to take care a bit for my life in 30 years ;)
