It really seems that the new Sony Clie is selling well, and it deserves it!

On one of the biggest PDA shops in germany, online ones at least, [Palmshop](http://www.palmshop.de/), they have a list of the top selling products in the last 7 days, including % of sales. The Clie is currently over 50% and they even list when they will be shipping it the next time!!!

If I wouldn't want Bluetooth and a Compact Flash expansion slot, I would be really thinking about this baby. 

If you are looking for a PDA, check it out at [Clie Plaza](http://www.clieplaza.com/). If you are not looking, don't, because afterwards you will be looking ;)
