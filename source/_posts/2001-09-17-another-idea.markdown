Terror feeds on Anger. Anger feeds on Poverty. At least partly. And I think poverty is a huge part on the climat in Afghanistan. So what if we were to send in billions of dollars of medicine, food, any non-military help? With a UN/US sticker and flag on all the packages and products to show people that we care for their suffering and that the US and the world is not trying to kill them all. 

The thing is that lack of information is another of the big problems. These people just have no idea what the western world is really like. If our actions lead to more suffering and poverty then the anger and terror will only grow.

The challenge would be to do this but try to still hold those who did this responsible.
