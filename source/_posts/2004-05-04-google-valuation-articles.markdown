We are starting to get into the real world, slowly but surely. Thanks to [John Battelle](http://battellemedia.com/) I just found two articles that dig a little deeper. [This CBS Marketwatch article](http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B6A147405%2D7EE3%2D41AE%2D828E%2D5189AF703309%7D&amp;siteid=mktw) just digs a bit into the cash flow including some comparison to other companies. Business week is [looking at Google's CAPEX](http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/may2004/tc2004054_9432_tc119.htm), which at 25% of revenue seems amazingly high. This could really mean that they are up to something way bigger than their current gig.

&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; As of page 50 of the S-1 filing, they have over 200 Million USD of guaranteed revenue share payments for the next 12 months.
