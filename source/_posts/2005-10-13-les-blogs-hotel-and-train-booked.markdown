Greetings everyone. I just booked my hotel and train to [Les Blogs](http://lesblogs.typepad.com/). I will be departing Cologne around 7 AM on Monday to arrive at 11:00 in Paris, possibly a bit late but there do not seem to be any earlier trains. I am staying at the Hotel that [is recommended](http://lesblogs.typepad.com/blog/2005/10/hotel_recommend.html) for Les Blogs, the [Champerret ElysÃ©es Hotel](http://champerret-elysees.com/). Just one thing though. I just booked via their website and paid 91 EURs for the night in a single standard room. The prices from the organizers might be for a bigger room but otherwise try to book via the website of the hotel for now as it will be cheaper. There were 12 rooms left when I booked.
