The ads for &lt;a title=&quot;Bush in 30 Seconds&quot; href=&quot;http://www.moveon.org/bushin30seconds/people/&quot;&gt;Bush in 30 Seconds are now out and you can vote. I would say this one goes to &quot;If The Bush Administration Was Your Roommate&quot;, &quot;Pop Quiz&quot; and &quot;School Yard Politics&quot;.
