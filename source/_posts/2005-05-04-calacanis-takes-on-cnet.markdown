Calacanis [takes on CNet in an open letter](http://calacanis.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000177042181/) about who has the right ethics or if blogs don't have it at all really. It hints on a good idea though, ethics and being sure of the right research having gone into a report on any web site. It needs to be seen as another way though, because ethics in journalism is an important thing. It is actually something that journalists will have to put more importance to. The thing is that blogs do have ethics, especially because they are so open. They can't afford not to. That's a different way of going at ethics though. A reader will have to be sure that it's a big enough blog so that through its readers, errors in it's articles will be pointed out by those readers. 

This is the niche that journalists will have to focus one. The New York Times will have to make an extra effort so that the readers will be sure that it's reporting will be very good, ethical and correct without the need for feedback. If they can't achieve that, then readers can as well read a diverse sets of blogs to get their news, getting the unbiased opinion through diversity. The transaction costs of reading different things are boiling down having to read more in these times, so having a good magazine will boil down to boiling down the news to the basic truth, the basic unbiased reporting, with high ethics.
