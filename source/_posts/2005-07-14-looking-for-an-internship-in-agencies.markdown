Yes, that's the plural of agency. The [German Direct Marketing Verband](http://www.ddv.de/) has launched [the Young Talents Agency Tour](http://www.youngtalents.ddv.de/ddv.html), in which 20 people can have the opportunity to have an internship inside several different agencies in different cities, if I understand it correctly. Very good start if you are looking into getting into the agency/internet/marketing/direct marketing space.
