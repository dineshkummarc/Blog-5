I just found &lt;a title=&quot;m a x - l o n g i n . c o m&quot; href=&quot;http://www.max-longin.com/index2.html&quot;&gt;m a x - l o n g i n . c o m via [Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com/). It's a Bed designed by Max Longin and it kind of hangs in the air, movable, only attached via 4 strings. To translate the german page: &quot;This progressive sleepingplace doesn't inhibit the movements of lying or loving, but balances them out, leading them peace.&quot; The bed costs almost 4000 EURs.

So for 4000 EURs you can have the earth moving whenever you turn arround in your sleep. And then you have the &quot;loving&quot; bit, which might be a lot more interesting.
