Ok, I made the move, even though [Nico](http://www.lumma.de/) from [Blogg.de](http://www.blogg.de/) suggested using Blogg.de as my blogging engine. Sorry Nico. I just feel somehow connected to the Six Log people for now. I have already sent people from Germany to Blogg.de though, so not all is lost ;)
 everything ;)


&lt;!-- more --&gt;


But anyway. For the sake of simplicity and to not have to worry about updates and everything, I opted to move all my stuff from MovableType to TypePad, with my Homepage currently building up at [oliver.thylmann.com](http://oliver.thylmann.com/). I am already feeling happy with TypePad even though I will likely have to make some suggestions in the next few weeks for improvements. At the moment you can only do moblogging to one blog or photo album for example. It works via a secret eMail I can send stuff to and it would be easy (I believe) to allow me to have 3 of those eMails.

Looking forward to posting some more now. Let's see how this goes. First thing I have to do is wait for Google to index this site so I can have it searchable again. This is something truely missing from TypePad, a good search integrated into your blog. A well. Can't have everything :)
