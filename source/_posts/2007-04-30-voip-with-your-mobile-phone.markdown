Lots of tools are coming out that are great for use with your mobile phone and to save money on calls. The thing is that I have a Base contract which gives me free call germany wide to fixed lines and some mobile phones. With [Cellity](http://cellity.com) I can still save on the other mobile phones with a price of 15 cents versus 25 cents. That's already nice. But the really good deal comes in when I think about international calls. Here I had another look at [Jajah](http://jajah.com), which I really like from the general idea. I would be paying 15 cents for international calls to many countries via that one which is a lot cheaper than the 69 cents I pay with my mobile phone, and a client is available to use, sadly not on my E70 though.

Looking at Cellity though, which through their client, available for the E70, is a lot easier to use, I can get 9 cents a minute to the US and many EU countries. Cellity wins over Jajah here. The thing is that Jajah is available everywhere, world wide, so I will probably need both accounts if I really want to save. What I still want to have really, is something to save when roaming in other countries, that still seems to be some time away though.

I did just figure out that there is one cheaper version for me. I can dial into our Asterisk Box in the office from the mobile phone, get a free dial tone and dial out to the US and many European Countries for under 0,4 cents a minute. Sorry guys. QSC wins here. :)

It's an interesting space though and I am looking forward to seeing stuff develop over time. If Cellity can internationalize their system somehow, this would start to really rock the mobile world. They are at a good start already though with a fairly nice client that runs on a lot of phones out there.
