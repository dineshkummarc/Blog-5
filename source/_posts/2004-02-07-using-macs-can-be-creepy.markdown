Most Mac Laptops are probably equipped with WiFi and now they also have Rendezvous, which is there to connect to other PCs with Rendezvous in the same network automatically. It can be used to write a text file together or to share your iTunes music list with others in the same network. This just as an introduction to what Pierre writes about in &lt;a title=&quot;iVoyeurism&quot; href=&quot;http://pierre.typepad.com/pierre/2004/02/ivoyeurism.html&quot;&gt;iVoyeurism. :)
