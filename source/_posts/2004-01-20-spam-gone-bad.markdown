Comment Spam on blogs is starting to get a problem, as many people who are actively blogging know. I recently moved my blog from a virtual server over to Typepad. Thanks to this, I am starting to figure that these MovableType spam-bots, or whatever we might call them, are connecting directly to the comment script and not do the article itself. Why? I am still getting spam on my old blog while every damn page of that blog is automatically redirected to the new one here. They might get in there via some category links, but they will never get onto the page where they leave a comment, simply being redirected to the new site via a 301 error and a Location header redirect.

These spam people are weird. :)
