I might have found my harddisk video recorder. Starting May 21st, the [Fast Personal Video Recorder PV 100](http://www.tv-server.de/content/pvr/index.htm) will be sold for â‚¬555 (â‚¬499 at Lidl) will be sold in Germany including a [TVTV](http://www.tvtv.de/cgi-bin/WebObjects/EPG.woa) subscription for 60 days. With the subscription you can program the video recorder remotely via the TVTV website without the need for a DSL connection. It will work simply via the standard cable and that for only 55EURs per year. It can then similar to TiVo record your preferred shows and or the important bits of the European Football Championship on it's 80gig harddisk. Very nice I have to say. And the price seems to be at least ok.
