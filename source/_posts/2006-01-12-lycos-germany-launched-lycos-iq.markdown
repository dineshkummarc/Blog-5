Oliver just [posted](http://www.agenturblog.de/archives/2006/01/lycos-iq-startet-heute.php) that Lycos Germany has opened the doors to [Lycos iQ](http://iq.lycos.de/), a new answers platform for Germany. I played with it the last few days and it's pretty nice and simple. You get a profile and can add tags to what you feel you are an expert in, and people ask questions and tag them with subjects. When you answer questions that are not for your current tags, that tag gets added to your list and you slowly but surely build up a profile of yourself and the things you are an expert in. All in all a pretty nice system and having Lycos behind it means that they might just get it big. If you want to see the people who are behind it all you can check out the [Lycos iQ Blog](http://www.iqblog.de/), which includes [Oliver in his car](http://www.iqblog.de/2006/01/introducing-the-team-oliver.php), filmed with his new Nokia N90 I presume. :)

If you haven't noticed already, all of this is in German :)
