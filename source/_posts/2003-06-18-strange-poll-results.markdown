[This piece](http://www.charlotte.com/mld/observer/news/6086632.htm) on the Charlotte Observer shows what Americans seem to have believed in relation to Iraq and 9/11.  A few examples: &quot;*A third of the American public believes U.S. forces found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, according to a recent poll, and 22 percent said Iraq actually used chemical or biological weapons. But no such weapons have been found, nor is there evidence they were used recently in Iraq. Before the war, half of those polled in a survey said Iraqis were among the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11, 2001. But most of them were from Saudi Arabia. None were Iraqis.*&quot;
