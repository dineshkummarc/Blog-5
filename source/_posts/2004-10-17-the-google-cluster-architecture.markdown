&lt;b&gt; (I needed to edit this because I linked to the wrong article. Sorry for that one.)

Originally I thought that through [Amiri's post](http://www.amiri.info/index.php/weblog/how_google_was_built/) I found great article about Google's architecture. What I did find was [ The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine](http://www-db.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html) which is a history of Google from an early paper by the founders. What I thought I had found was something that I had printed out some time ago. This was [Web Search for a Planet: The Google Cluster Architecture](http://www.computer.org/micro/mi2003/m2022.pdf), which goes into great detail on the general Google artchitecture and the price to computation ratio and importance of power usage and when it is wise to invest where... Lots of stuff in there that will make a manager drool about the detail in which they go. How much more can you spend for more energy efficient machines if you look at your power costs? This is just one example. Great read. Both of them actually. Good that I did the linking wrong at the beginning. :)
