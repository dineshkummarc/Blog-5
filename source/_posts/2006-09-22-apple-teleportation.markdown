From time to time Cringely has some great posts and this time [Beam Me Up](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20060922.html) has me thinking again. He talks about iTV and that there is an USB port on the machine. Attach an iSight camera and you can do Video Conferencing via your HDTV. Now that is cool indeed. If it's true.
