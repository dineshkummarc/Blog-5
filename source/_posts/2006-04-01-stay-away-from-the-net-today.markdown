Bitflux has a [a good post today](http://blog.bitflux.ch/archive/2006/04/01/stay-away-from-the-net-today.html). I simply quote what they said on this April 1st:

*Just go outside, enjoy the sun or do something else useful :)
The net is a waste of time today, and the day didn't even really start in the US ...*
We already have Google Romance, Jeremy going to Google, and other fun stuff. Going out now. I'll just clear my RSS reader on monday. :)
