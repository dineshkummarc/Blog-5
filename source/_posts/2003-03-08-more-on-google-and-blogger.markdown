In this story (&lt;a title=&quot;Google's Memory Upgrade - How Blogger could do more than improve Google's Web searches. By Steven Johnson&quot; href=&quot;http://slate.msn.com/id/2079747&quot;&gt;Google's Memory Upgrade - How Blogger could do more than improve Google's Web searches. By Steven Johnson&lt;/a&gt;) Steve Johnson argues that there might be something else which made Google buy Blogger. The idea is good. Get a Google/Blogger account and when you find interesting stuff, simply blog about it, which is likely better than bookmarking. This is something I use a lot in MovebleType now. By a simple right click in IE I can post a story about the current site I visit. This makes it very simple to remember the stuff you found interesting and in the end you can easily search you blog. Great stuff and an interesting concept.
