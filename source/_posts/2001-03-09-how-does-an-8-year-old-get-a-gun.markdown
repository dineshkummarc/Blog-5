Ok. I know the US holds their right to carry guns high but come on!!! How does an 8 year old get his hands on a gun??????

[Here](http://dailynews.philly.com/content/daily_news/2001/03/06/local/GUNN06.htm) is a story about an 8 year old, 3rd grader!!!, that threatened a 9 year old girl with the gun. In January a 10 year old student was arrested with an 9mm pistol in his hand bag. In a report from 1998-99 they found 39 fireamrs, 457 knives and 449 other weapons. Damn! 

Come people, think! I know we have knives in school here too (Germany) but there is one simple thing you can do. Get those damn guns of the street. Yeah yeah, they will always find a gun if they really want to. But they will not find it in some drawer at home! And no, tighter laws on where to keep the guns is not an option.

I really do not get it why people still need to be able to have a gun at home. It's not as if 70000000 people die here each day because some nut comes into their appartment and their only option would  have been to kill that person with their own gun. I actually feel quite safe here in germany.

And another thing. What does the world expect happens. I am a small school kid (no I am not, I am just making the assumption :)) with not enough attention. Now what do  I see on TV? These kids with 100000 cameras in their face and articles all over the news that killed somebody in school. I desperately want attention. I need attention. I want to be noticed. I can find a gun easily. If I am neglected and see no other way then I would also go into a school with a gun and start threatening people. I doubt I would shoot, I mean I just can't imaging what these kids are thinking, but I can see that they might just see no other way at the time then to prove their point.

Hmmm... back to work.
