It's done. I can now post via e-mail. It is done via this script:
 
http://www.ryan.net/email-to-blog.txt The only thing that I have to admit is that I didn't get procmail sorted out yet and hence I am using a simple shell script that looks for new mail and pipes that to the posting script. I probably need to do some further work on this or I will end up with something like [...] posts in case an e-mail is there but not from the right e-mail address. This sucks really, should be able to be worked out. If I were as good as I'd like to be I'd get procmail to run. My main problem here is that I do not have user home directories on the server I am using and need to somehow make procmail parse every single mail file for the right entries, which does not seem to be so easy. It will work eventually. For now, I can post via my tungsten and simply by e-mail. Woohooo! :) - oliver, posting via e-mail
