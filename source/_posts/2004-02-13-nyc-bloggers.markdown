[NYC Bloggers](http://www.nycbloggers.com/) is a very nice site using the GeoIP system. I have [my blog](http://owt.typepad.com/) geocoded too and you can find out who has their web site geocoded [in my neighborhood](http://geourl.org/near/?p=http://oliver.thylmann.com/).  What the [NYC Bloggers](http://www.nycbloggers.com/) site does it make it for NYC and put a map under it, allowing you to browse the city to find bloggers in every street. Great stuff indeed.
