That's the title of a [Fast Company](http://www.fastcompany.com/) article ([here](http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/81/blog.html)) which has some nice examples of blog use in corporations. I do still think that this will be big, the  blogging thing, even though it will loose a bit of its hype. The bigger thing might be that this is actually what might bring back the trust to corporations, which I have been trying to touch upon a little bit recently. The Cluetrain Manifesto was already talking about the voice that corporations need on the web, and this is starting to fall in place actually.
