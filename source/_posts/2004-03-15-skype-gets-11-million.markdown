[Skype](http://www.skype.com/) has just received [11 Million Pounds in Second Round Financing](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/5/36246.html). I have to agree though that VoIP will be a huge market and if Skype can get some partnerships with Telcos, then they will be able to let everyone do very cheap phone calls from any VoIP Telefone to anywhere in the World. This will rock, period. It will be interesting to see though what the Telcos will do to protect their long distance calling. :)
