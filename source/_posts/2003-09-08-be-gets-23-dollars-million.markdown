Oh boy. Microsoft is [paying Be Inc. $23 Million](http://news.com.com/2100-1016_3-5072391.html) as settlement for their law suit. I still have Be shares and the money, or rather the rest of it after some other costs, will be distributed among shareholders. :) I am looking forward to finding out how many pence, instead of 0 I will be getting per share. :)
