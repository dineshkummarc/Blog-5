We are all getting used to the idea of freemium but I am wondering if this will not implode because things are starting to add up. I really noticed when recently thinking (again) about how to restructure my services.
What is it for me:

  * $25 per year - Remember the Milk: I am definitely keeping this one as it is really cheap and a great deal especially with iPhone Integration through ToDo.

  * $59 per year - Vimeo: the service just rocks, period. I love how the videos end up and through the pro service I can really limit where videos are allowed to appear and keep my family videos sharable and save.

  * $12.60 a month - Squarespace: I just wanted to ditch servers and this is probably the first one that might have to go once I find a better solution but I didn't yet. Squarespace is really nice and if they finally get their social integration done I am starting to be really happy. It is the most expensive point though and I could just go with Wordpress.com and the biggest problem would be that my tags are shared with all wordpress people. Ah well.

  * Stopped - Flickr: I just stopped my premium Flickr subscription as I am sharing most pictures with Family on Squarespace and that is good enough. I might actually still need that somehow.

  * $99 per year - Dropbox: I am actually not paying yet as I have a 10GB account due to an early beta membership (u 900 ;)) but this will surely stick.

  * â‚¬5.95 per month - Xing: For my networking in Germany still a wonderful thing.

  * $49.95 per year - Plaxo Premium: I want my addressbook safe and I would actually love Xing to do this but they don't. Still really not happy in this field.

  * all the forgotten stuff: There are probably things I have forgotten as they end up coming on the bill once a year.

In the end, there will be more services like this and this is really starting to annoy me. It's all cheap enough to not think enough but it is adding up. All the &quot;small fees&quot; currently end up to be over 200 USD, more if I ever get the Dropbox Account.
So what subscriptions do you have? :)
Update: I am wondering if I should not just move to Wordpress.com, upload videos there, and so on. Anyone using Wordpress for Videos?
