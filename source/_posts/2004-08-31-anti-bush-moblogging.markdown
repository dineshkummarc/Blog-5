Nice [post by Mario](http://www.sixtus.net/index/P263/) with some links to different sites that are a quasi group moblog of the happenings around the meeting fo the republican party in New York. Very nice indeed. This is something that journalists will hardly be able to capture because it's just hundreds of personal shots, ranging from huge groups, posters to babies with &quot;[Bush makes me cry](http://rncprotests.textamerica.com/?r=1322577)&quot; t-shirts. 

**Update**: Karen has mailed me and she seems to be the person behind the t-shirt. She sent me her url: [bushmakesmecry.com](http://bushmakesmecry.com/) where she sells the shirts and the picture of the baby is awfully similar. As she has provided phone number and eMail I am resonably certain that the moblog post and the site are from the same person and in any case, I thinks it's a cool shirt.
