We made it to [DLD06](http://www.dld06.com/) and the place is getting really packed. We still got some seats upstairs and the show is about to start. They really put some money into this but the list of sponsors is impressive too. It will be nice to see what the next two days bring. One thing is to be remembered though... this is not so exclusive as it was planned to be with a lot more people being invited.
