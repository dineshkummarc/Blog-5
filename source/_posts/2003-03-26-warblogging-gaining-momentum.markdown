The german magazine Der Spiegel, has a story on &lt;a title=&quot;Ganz andere Kriegsnachrichten - Netzwelt - SPIEGEL ONLINE&quot; href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzkultur/0,1518,241981,00.html&quot;&gt;Warblogging: Ganz andere Kriegsnachrichten (check babelfish.altavista.com if you want to read it). They mention several interesting sites which I'll try to list here.

[Warblogging.com](http://www.warblogging.com/) is reporting from the war in a real blogging fashion. Some might say that [Warblogs:cc](http://www.warblogs.cc/) is even truer to the blogging culture, being a very frequently updated page with lots of links to other articles. While I am not sure why they put [Iraq Body Count](http://www.iraqbodycount.net/) in their list, it's a noteworthy site which keeps track of civilian casulaties in Gulf War II. I already wrote about [Back to Irak 2.0](http://www.back-to-iraq.com/), which is the site of an independant journalist who is by now, actually on the way to northern Irak to do some really independant reporting. I already mentioned [Salam Pax](http://www.dear_raed.blogspot.com/) several times. If you want to read something from people who are 100% against war, check out [No War Blog](http://www.nowarblog.org/). A site that needs to be mentioned, or so it seems, is [The Agonist](http://www.agonist.org/), which is run by Sean-Paul Kelly who studied/s International Relations, taught English in South Korea and generally was referred to by the NYT as a &quot;mastermind&quot;, or at least [OxBlog](http://oxblog.blogspot.com/) says so.
