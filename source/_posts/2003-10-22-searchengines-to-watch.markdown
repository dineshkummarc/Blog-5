I just read an article on [The State of the Search Engine Industry](http://www.searchenginewatch.com/searchday/article.php/3095821) at Searchenginewatch.com and was directed, again, to [Teoma](http://www.teoma.com/) as a new an upcoming search engine. I really need to look at that a bit closer. The other site they mention is [Singingfish](http://www.singingfish.com/), which is devoted to multimedia search and just hit 2 million queries a day! This really shows the power of multimedia. They ended with saying that IBM is the one to watch in this space and based on what I heard about [Webfountain](http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000911.php) up till now. If they can scale it up to personal use then that might really work out quite well.
