The is a [good article](http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_10/wiggins/) on First Monday about changes on Google at the time when the planes hit the US on September 11th. When things started to happen over 6000 people per minute searched for CNN on Google. Check some search terms [here](http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist/9-11-search.html). Interesting to see really, also how Nostradamus started to move up as a search term with a little lag.
