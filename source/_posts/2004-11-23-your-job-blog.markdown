You might wonder if I will now talk about [Blogger Jobs](http://www.recruiting.com/blogger_jobs/) but that's not the case. I am actually just talking about the fact that one reason to keep a blog is that it's a wonderful engine to drive intrest in yourself and to further your connections. It is very likely that you will get a job offer via your blog or that it will at least help you in getting the right job for you. This is very evident in a series of posts you can find on Jeremy Zawodny's blog. It started with [Russel Yahooing soon](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003059.html), follow by [Jeremy Cole doing it too!](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003062.html). Russel talks [a bit more deeply](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008168.html) about his move to Yahoo!, which is quite interesting. Jeremy now finished it off with his post on [ title=&quot;Blogs as Professional Lubricant (Jeremy Zawodny's blog)&quot;&gt;Blogs as Professional Lubricant](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003079.html) with which I can very much agree.
