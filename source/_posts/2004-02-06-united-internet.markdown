I am actually starting to think a bit more about [United Internet](http://www.united-internet.de/) as an investment. They are getting awfully big, have some great service already and are only now moving from Germany to the US. 1&amp;1 is one of the biggest hosting providers out there. GMX has arround 15 Million eMail accounts and 12.000 new ones per day. 200.000 are paying member with 50k added per quarter. 1&amp;1 had 2 million hosting customers. Much more info is in their last years [USA Roadshow Presentation](http://www.united-internet.de/website/content/ir/berichte/Roadshow%20USA%2002.06.%20-%2006.06.2003.pdf).

They are valued relatively highly ([stock quote](http://aktien.onvista.de/snapshot.html?ID_OSI=81232)) but then again they didn't really push into other countries too hard yet. Thinking.

&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; United Internet just opened up [Alturo.de](http://www.alturo.de/) as a low end web host for self serve customers. 40 EURs per month get you your own server, with full root access, mysql, php, the works, inclusive 150 GB of traffic. It makes you wonder how they pay for it.
