Siemens has just published the new Xelibri lineup for the fall collection. For those who do not remember, Xelibri is more of a fashion phone with limited quantities and with new editions every 6 months. This is the second lineup and the pictures on infosync.no look very nice. [Check it out](http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/4161.html). I particularly like the [X5](http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/4161,2.html) and [X7](http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/4161,4.html). Might we have a Swatch of Mobile Phones on our hands with these things becoming collector items?
