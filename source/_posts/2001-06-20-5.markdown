That's the number of girls and boys already having been thrown into the fountain on the main square here.

Yes, you might have guessed it. The sound check for Pur (not BAP as I said yesterday) has started and the first fans have arrived. It's still 7 hours till the concert starts though. 

Going out to look around a bit.
