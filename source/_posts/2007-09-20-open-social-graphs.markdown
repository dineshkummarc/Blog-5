&lt;p&gt;Open Social Graphs are slowly gaining traction and now [Dirk](http://olbertz.de) launched [Noserub](http://noserub.com/) which is an open social network, something that allows for social graph portability. The idea of decentralization of your social graph becomes a little bit clearer based on Dirk's last post in the Noserub Blog called &lt;em&gt;[What decentralization is all about](http://noserub.com/blog/archives/17-What-decentralisation-is-all-about.html)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you see that you can look at [Dirk's profile on identoo.com](http://identoo.com/dirk.olbertz) from where you can visit mine on id.thylmann.net because I am listed as one of his friends. From there you can go to another profile that is again on identoo.com. These different nodes are now connected, and if I change something in my profile on id.thylmann.net, dirk notices on identoo.com. When I change my name in my id.thylmann.net account, it gets propagated to my other connections (in a future version ;)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire system means that my social graph is my social graph. I have full portability of my data. I will also be able to move it to other services and I will be able to give access to my information to whom I please. This is really just a start, but it is looking good.&lt;/p&gt;
