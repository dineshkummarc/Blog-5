I just read a very good article in the german weekly *Die Zeit*, about why the US Dollar will fall further. In short, the US currently needs something like 50 Billion USD of fresh money from foreign investors per month because the country is spending more than it makes internally. Foreign investors have now started to remove their money from the stock exchange in the US with only Japan and China keeping the Dollar up where it currently is to make sure that their own export goods are still cheap. This cannot go on forever. It seems that the US is overspending their internal production by 5%, which is said to be a number far higher than any well established country ever had.
