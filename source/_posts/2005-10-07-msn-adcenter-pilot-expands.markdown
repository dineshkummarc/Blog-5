Search Engine Roundtable is &lt;a title=&quot;MSN adCenter Pilot Program Invites&quot; href=&quot;http://www.seroundtable.com/archives/002622.html&quot;&gt;reporting that the MSN adCenter, their answer to AdWords, Overture, Miva, etc. is expanding into a US trial. Things are hotting up in the space and I am looking forward to seeing them all fight for traffic like crazy.
