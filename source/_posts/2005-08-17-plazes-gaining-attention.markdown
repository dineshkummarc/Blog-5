Recently [Plazes](http://beta.plazes.com/home/) has integrated Google Maps and now tracks where you have been, if you allow them to. Ross Mayfield actually seems to [like it](http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2005/08/where_is.html) and I have to agree with him. Plazes is starting to become more and more interesting, especially if you start adding some friends. I'll be trying to use it some more now especially when I start moving around.
