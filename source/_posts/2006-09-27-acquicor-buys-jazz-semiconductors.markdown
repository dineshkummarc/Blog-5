I wrote about [Acquicor in March](http://www.typepad.com/t/trackback/4464377) and the company has now filled it's purpose and bought Jazz Semiconductors for $260 Million. As a reminder, the company was formed simply to buy another company. That's called SPAC, special purpose acquisition corporation. :) ([source](http://www.venturebeat.com/wire/2006/09/27/wozs-blank-check-co-acquicor-to-acquire-jazz-semi-for-260m/))
