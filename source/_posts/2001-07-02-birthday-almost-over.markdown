Well, my birthday is almost over. Ahhh... here in germany that is. In the US, if I were there, I would still have my birthday for some time. Then again, in Japan it is already over. Hmmmm... :)

Anyway. Thank you all the people for wishing me a good birthday and also thank you to LiveJournal for their automated birthday gratulations :)

The day was very good. It started out nice at my girlfriends place where I got some very cool gifts including a very nice cake just for me :). And I did not expect the gifts, which are always the best. The backpack is something I really needed and I got some very cool pizza plates. Very very nice. /me very happy.

One of the fun things to start with was that I got a card which was for people born under my star-sign (hope that's the right name). And it said that Monday was a good day for me (cool!) and the numbers 2 and 7 are my lucky numbers! WAY COOL! I am not into this kind of things but hey, this is just too good. And it was not a card for people born on the 2nd of July being a Monday :)

So the day continued very well and I even got a parking space directly in front of the house. This is _very_ rare! So much for luck eh?!

The other gifts I got were also wonderful and especially mostly not something I expected. And this turning out so good is not something that happens every day. Again I had a wonderful time with my brother and his girlfriend and later went to dinner with them a new restaurant which was also amazing.

I had some kind of very tasty chicken with a spizy-tomato-jogurt sauce. Now you had small pieces of bread, in the sauce (so all filled with sauce) and the chicken above that. Really interesting. Together with the salad it was really amazing.

Next we played Siedler, a very cool game which my brother gave me with two extensions. We started simple without the extensions though. I WON! TWICE! Well actually not twice. Just the first time I would have won I blew it by only having won if the illegal thing I did were allowed. :)

In the middle some of my friends called and said he could come to the party on Saturday.

I really have to use the last 45 minutes of this wonderful day.

Hmmm... what am I doing here? :)

Talk to you soon.
