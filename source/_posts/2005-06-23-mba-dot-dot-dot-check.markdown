&lt;p&gt;
I just received my last results from the MBA course at the [Open University Business School](http://oubs.open.ac.uk). I can now offlicially call myself MBA, something Tom Peters calls &lt;I&gt;Major Bullshit Artist&lt;/I&gt;. I am very happy I did it and very happy it is now finished. On to new things.
&lt;/p&gt;
