Woohooo... I can go podcasting. Relax, I won't. At least I am not actively thinking about it, but Odeo users, at least I, now got access to the &lt;a title=&quot;Studio&quot; href=&quot;http://odeo.com/create/studio&quot;&gt;Odeo: Studio&lt;/a&gt;. This is a really simple way to record a bit of audio from anywhere where there is a mic. This might lead to some interesting things.
