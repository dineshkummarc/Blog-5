MovableType 2.65 has [released](http://www.movabletype.org/news/2003_12.shtml#000877) and I just upgraded. I am already looking forward to 3.0, which is said to come next quarter. The switch from LiveJournal to MovableType was a very good one and I love to have full control over my site and have my content in my own database. Probably the only reason I am not moving to [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com/), which has some very nice features though. Enough rambling. On to other things. if you use MT, upgrade.
