I just took a look at the Apple shop and saw the Bestsellers on the right. Interesting to look at:

&lt;div&gt;


### 
Bestsellers Apple Store Germany
 ###

&lt;/div&gt;
* iPod shuffle
* iPod mini
* Mac mini
* iPod
* Altec Lansing inMotion iM3

This seems to be the same list in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, ... I presume this List is for Europe then, their European Distribution Hub or something. All in all, in Europe, the Mac mini seems to be selling better than the iPod at the moment, at least as the best mac only beaten by the iPod mini. To be expected but still interesting to see.
