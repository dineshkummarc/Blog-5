Two wonderful pictures can be found in the following post about &lt;a title=&quot;MINI Cooper vs Ford F150&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bridger.us/2002/12/16/CrashTestingMINICooperVsFordF150&quot;&gt;Crash Testing a MINI Cooper vs Ford F150. The Ford is a huge car but the Mini comes out miles ahead in security and passenger safety if you just look at the picture. Scary really.
