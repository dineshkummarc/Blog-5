So you are building a company? You do not have a real clue on how search engines work? You want to be able to follow the chatter about it and pitch in? &lt;a title=&quot;In the Click&quot; href=&quot;http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/0,4621,316408,00.html&quot;&gt;In the Click is a nice article on entrepreneur.com about Search Engine Optimization and how powerful it can be. I would like to caution a little bit because the amount of traffic greatly depends on the amount of traffic the keywords you target generate. If noone searches for the keyword then that's that. If they do, congratulations.
