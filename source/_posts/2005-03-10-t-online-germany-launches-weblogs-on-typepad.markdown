Loic just posted that [T-Online Germany launches weblogs on TypePad](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2005/03/tonline_germany.html). Wow. Congratulations [Heiko](http://www.hebig.com/)!!! Really not bad and the prices are great by the way. Check it out [here](http://service.t-online.de/c/33/96/95/3396954.html). It's a little bit hidden under Services -&gt; Dienste -&gt; Community -&gt; Weblogs. But that will likely change in the future.
