Long time no wireless post but then I found pictures of a Sony Ericsson phone design competition on SlashPhone via [Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/sony-ericsson-mobile-phone-concept-competition-023717.php) . Very very cool examples and some of them might really work out. Great to look at. Check it out: &lt;a title=&quot;Sony Ericsson Concept Phone Design Competition&quot; href=&quot;http://www.slashphone.com/84/1015.html&quot;&gt;Sony Ericsson Concept Phone Design Competition&lt;/a&gt;
