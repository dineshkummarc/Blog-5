I have to fully agree with Fight the Bull, who posted a press release from SAP in their post entitled: [We can't make this stuff up](http://www.fightthebull.com/blog/2005/04/we-cant-make-this-stuff-up.html):

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.fightthebull.com/blog/2005/04/we-cant-make-this-stuff-up.html&quot;&gt;100 industry-specific analytic applications that empower users with innovative new ways to drive core processes and business decisions based on actionable business insight. SAP Analytics are a new breed of model-driven composite applications that change the analytic application playing field across more than 25 industries. 

I absolutely agree with Jon in that this really finally explains to us what analytical applications are. Companies seriously have to think about writing stuff in a language that other people can understand. Sadly that also means that they can't build some products and have the PR and Marketing department build some meaning and reason around it.
