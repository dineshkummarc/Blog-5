As seen on Le Meur's WebLog [ties are fobidden at davos](http://www.u-blog.net/loic/note/57166). He will be part of a panel about blogging at [this year's world economic forum](http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Annual+Meeting+2004) together with [Joi Ito](http://joi.ito.com/) and somebody he calls M. Burda, which might either be the chairman of [Hubert Burda Media](http://www.hubert-burda-media.com/start.html), fitting with the traditional media aspect he is talking about, or about [Michael C. Burda](http://www.iza.org/index_html?mainframe=http%3A//www.iza.org/iza/en/webcontent/personnel/photos/index_html%3Fkey%3D71), who at least has a first name starting with M. ;)

Sadly I can't find a feed available of the session. You will likely find some interesting ones though, based on the [List of Selected Participants](http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Annual+Meeting+2004%5CList+of+Selected+Participants). Check for the webcasts [here](http://www.worlductx.com/worldeconomicforum_annualmeeting2004/).
