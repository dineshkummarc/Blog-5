A few weeks ago I posted about Ormigo being nominated as a winner for the Red Herring Europe 2008, and now (before the post gets pushed from the front page due to light blogging ;)) I can say that we are among the 100 winners! If we counted correctly there are 12 winners in Germany and 3 of those are in Cologne. :)

Henning is now in Malta accepting the award for us and probably having some thought provoking discussions with other entrepreneurs.
