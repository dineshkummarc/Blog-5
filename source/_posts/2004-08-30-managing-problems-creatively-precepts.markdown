&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of different techniques you can use, and some ordering is needed. For the OUBS this is done with 12 precepts as a framework. These can be grouped together further in terms of their giving a sense of direction, or being part of Handy's creative climate (Curiosity, Forgiveness, Love). Underpinning all of this is Schon's idea of the &quot;reflective practitioner&quot;, meaning somebody that goes into deep double-loop learning.
I'll now give a very short overview over these. While they are easy to grasp as a first step. Most of them have some deeper meaning that needs some thinking on your part. I highly suggest taking each part and think about what this really means for you, potentially going back to the book to get some insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curiosity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Precept 1: Adopt a 'set to break sets'&lt;/em&gt;: Think different, get people that think different, take different perspective, different different different&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Precept 2: Explore the 'givens'&lt;/em&gt;: Context is important for a problem. Maybe the context was wrong. Use Assumption surfacing or Reversals to get behind it. Get a fresh view on it. Try being very clear about your environment, trying to notice things you take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Precept 3: Broad picture, local detail&lt;/em&gt;: You can store an enormous amount of information, but only very few items at a time. Use mind maps or similar techniques to go broad and deep at the same time or rather one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Precept 4: Value play&lt;/em&gt;: Play is central to learning, just think about being a kid. You learn by trial and error. It loosens things up if you can just play with a problem. For this you need to create a special settings, choose team members that trust each other and you can simply use such techniques as a way to build a team.
&lt;em&gt;Precept 5: Build up, don't knock down&lt;/em&gt;: Go from 'Yes, but...' to 'Yes, and...'. Value people.
&lt;em&gt;Precept 6: Live with Looseness&lt;/em&gt;: Things will be confusing, uncertain, contradictory, sceptical and more. Especially in whicked problems you need to live with it and let go to have a map built over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Precept 7: It is there already - nurture it&lt;/em&gt;: Creativity is probably already there, well below its potential. Try removing soem barriers. Delegate, make ideas welcome, schedule idea time.
&lt;em&gt;Precept 8: Involve others&lt;/em&gt;: We all have different view, and something normal for us might not be for somebody else. New ideas come from this. Enjoy the differences.
&lt;em&gt;Precept 9: Connect and be receptive&lt;/em&gt;: ideas can be triggered from your environment. These can be related to the problem or not. You need to link problems and triggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A sense of direction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Precept 10: Know what you really want&lt;/em&gt;: As they say &quot;if you don't know where you want to go, you probably won't get there&quot;. The way is not important, or rather needs to be loose, but the goal should be clear.
&lt;em&gt;Precept 11: Cycle often and close late&lt;/em&gt;: Try not to appear decisive, or stop at the first solution. Cycle a few times to allow extra deeper information to filter in.
&lt;em&gt;Precept 12: Manage the process&lt;/em&gt;: People, Place and Process. These are important and should be managed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being a reflective practitioner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep creativity and analysis apart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand what you are doing and why&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn from the experience of others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a nice checklist on page 113 of the book for self-evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
