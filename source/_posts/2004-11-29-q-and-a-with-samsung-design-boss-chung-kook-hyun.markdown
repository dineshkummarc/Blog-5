First if were products, then came services and the next thing will be Design. This or something similar can be found in Tom Peters Re-Imagine, the Design chapter. Now one of my tutors in the MBA, Ralf Beuker, has [ title=&quot;the design management weblog | by ralf beuker :: 28.11.04 - 04.12.04 Archives&quot;&gt;linked to](http://www.design-management.de/archives/week_2004_11_28.html#000302) an article in BusinessWeek entitled [Q&amp;A With Samsung Design Boss Chung Kook Hyun](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_48/b3910010.htm) and it's a great read. Ralf Beuker is actually working on growing the awareness of Design Management and he was one of the people that really made me realize the importance of it, much before reading Re-Imagine. The article itself is very good at showing that design is really all encompassing, all around us and amazingly important. As Ralf says, who's not at least thinking about the Apple iPod for himself or as a gift?
