I had some server troubles ([again](http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000003.php) and [again](http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000013.php)) just now. In general [this vServer](http://www.vserver.de/de/v/index.html) was relatively stable in the last few months, even though a bit slow from time to time even at my moderate amount of hits. But, now they wanted to charge me for the next 6 months and failed. The wonderful thing is that they didn't fail because of me. There was money in my account and the account didn't change, so everything is just fine. But because they failed to get the money they now want 44 EURs extra simple for emm... for emmm... for failing to do their job properly I guess. 

I am not the happiest camper at the moment and I already mailed them in relation to that. I suggested to either pay back the 44 EURs or charge them to my account for a further few months of hosting. As you might have guess, I paid. Why? Because after they couldn't get the money of my account yesterday (the bill was sent on the 27th of November), they turned the server off this morning. They might at least have sent me an e-mail!!! It's the same process damn it. Either turn off server or send e-mail and turn off server 3 days later. How hard can that be??? And they needed a copy of my wire transfer to prove that I sent the money to turn this thing back up.

I now have a headache, 44 EURs less and waisted some time. 

But this entry lets me feel a little better ;)
