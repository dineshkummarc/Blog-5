It seems that [TypePad will have a Filemanager](http://www.typepad.com/resources/2004/03/file_manager.html), which makes this blogger very happy. I don't know if that makes me a control freak but I sometimes am wondering what is left arround in my directory on the TypePad server. I thought about submitted a feature request to TypePad but didn't as I thought that they would either provide one sooner or later or had some way to make sure that there was no stale stuff in my directory. Seems like I was right :)
