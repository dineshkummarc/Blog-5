I recently read that an [Orkut invitation is worth $11](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=2982373148) ([read here](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000267.php)) and that already made me smile, until I received some feedback via my contact form:

&lt;I&gt;hey, long time reader of your blog. great to see you got into the whole orkut scene. do you have any invitations you could maybe send my way?

-chris
&lt;/i&gt;

First of all, maybe I do, maybe I don't. If I do, why would I send &quot;invitations&quot; (see plural) his way? He only needs one doesn't he? And then there is the problem that I don't know who chris is. Sorry chris. He knows me, but I don't know him... am I achieving stardom here? Will people start greeting me on the street soon? I think I am a few readers away from that but emm... continuing the original thread.

You (talking to Chris now) are (as a long time reader) obviously reading this, so please give me a bit more info on you, just in case I do have an invitation (watch singular) for Orkut. Not that I do. But in general this is a friends network so I invite friends, or people I at least consider to know a little tiny bit, either by knowing them personally or by reading their blog or something else. 

I am looking forward to see what comes of all of this. :)
