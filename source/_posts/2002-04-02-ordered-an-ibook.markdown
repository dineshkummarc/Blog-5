Ahh... I just ordered a refurbished iBook plus 256MB ram and Airport card for a total of 2100 EUR. How wonderful. Sadly, it is not 100% sure if I get it yet because it is not in the main distribution center but everything should be fine and it should arrive within a week. Long time, but hey, it will be here :) Woohooo :) 12.1&quot; 600Mhz model if anyone cares to know :) Wohooo... :)
