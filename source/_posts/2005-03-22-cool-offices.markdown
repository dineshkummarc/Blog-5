&lt;a title=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;http://aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=19658#1&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a great story about a visit at Pixar and it holds some very nice photos. In general, the office space they created is amazing, very thought provoking, free thinking  kind of system. Take a look at what the animators created for themselves. These shots moved me so much that I didn't even care too much about the server pics, and that means a lot ;)
