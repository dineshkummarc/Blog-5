Well, I made it. I just got myself a playstation 2 and am very happy with it. I am looking forward for getting more games and looking into playstation 1 games too for I can play them on the ps2. Oli is happy :)

On top of that I just got my latest result from my tutor market assignements which went in at 81 of 100 points which is distinction level which rocks :) All that on finance. Cool.
