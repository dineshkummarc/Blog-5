Lots of people are giving money to support their potential president in the USA. If you want to find out who gives how much and where they live check out [Fund Race](http://www.fundrace.org/), which can give you the info [Warren Buffet gave his money](http://www.fundrace.org/neighbors.php?type=name&amp;lname=Buffett&amp;fname=Warren&amp;search=Search+by+Name) just as an example. Thanks for the pointer go to [Loic's  post about it](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2004/05/want_to_know_wh.html).
