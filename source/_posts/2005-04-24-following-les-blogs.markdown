Sadly I can't be in Paris on monday for [Les blogs](http://www.socialtext.net/loicwiki/index.cgi?internet_2_0) but I managed to get several friends to go so I will hopefully get the inside story ;) If you, like me, want to but can't go, here are two locations to get the latest info on all the fun.

-&gt; An RSS feed from Flickr is [here](http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=lesblogs&amp;format=rss_200) from the [lesblogs tag](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/lesblogs).
-&gt; Technorati has the &lt;a rel=&quot;tag&quot; href=&quot;http://www.technorati.com/tag/lesblogs&quot;&gt;lesblogs tagged posts but sadly not RSS feed that I know of.

There is also an extensive list right [here](http://www.socialtext.net/loicwiki/index.cgi?lesblogscoverage).

**Update**: Images are filling up on Flickr and it [seems](http://www.corante.com/getreal/archives/2005/04/25/les_blogs_paris_sort_of.php) like doing this at the french senate hasn't been the best idea ever ... well I still think it is but I do not suffer from coffee withdrawl... only because I am not there ... which is at least as sad as coffee withdrawl. :)
