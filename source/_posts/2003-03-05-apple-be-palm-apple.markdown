Looks like Steve Sakoman is [back at Apple](http://news.com.com/2100-1041-991061.html?tag=fd_top) after having worked on the Newton for Apple, then having founded Be, Inc, which was bought by Palm(Source) where he then worked. Good to see him working on one of the best operating systems out there again.
