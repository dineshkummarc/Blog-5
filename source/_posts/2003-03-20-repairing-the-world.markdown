&lt;a title=&quot;Repairing the World&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/16/opinion/16FRIE.html&quot;&gt;Repairing the World is an editorial by Thomas L. Friedman. 

*Why? What does Tony Blair get that George Bush doesn't? The only way I can explain it is by a concept from the Kabbalah called &quot;tikkun olam.&quot; It means, &quot;to repair the world.&quot; If you listened to Tony Blair's speeches in recent weeks they contain something so strikingly absent from Mr. Bush's. Tony Blair constantly puts the struggle for a better Iraq within a broader context of moral concerns. Tony Blair always leaves you with the impression that for him the Iraq war is just one hammer and one nail in an effort to do tikkun olam, to repair the world.*

*More than 50 years ago America won a war against European fascism, which it followed up with a Marshall Plan and nation-building, both a handout and a hand up â€” in a way that made Americans welcome across the world. Today is a D-Day for our generation. May our leaders have the wisdom of their predecessors from the Greatest Generation.  *
