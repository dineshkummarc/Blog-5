As I [just read](http://www.marketingwonk.com/archives/2004/01/14/moveon_selects_antibush_ad_for_broadcast_against_state_of_union/index.php) on MarketingWonk, MoveOn has just selected the Anti-Bush Ad, which will be aired before the State of the Union Address by Bush on January 20th. In total it will run on CNN from January 17th to 21st, costing as much as $300.000. MoveOn wants to run it on Super Bowl but this is currently not sure yet. You can watch it right on [Bush in 30 Seconds Dot Org](http://bushin30seconds.org/).
