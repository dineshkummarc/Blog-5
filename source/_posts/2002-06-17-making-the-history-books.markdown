Looks like germany's history books need to be rewritten tomorrow. At least in terms of the hottest day or something. Forecasts for this night are 15-21 degrees Celcius and tomorrow 38!?!?!?!? Degrees is scheduled. That is _hot_ for germany. I am sweating as it is at the moment with 30 degrees inside the place. Sadly, the fan is in brussels (not in the cellar like I thought). I WANT WIND! ;)
