This post goes to [Vivanco](http://www.vivanco.de/). We really like their USB Blackboard [Keyboard](http://195.244.96.172/cgi-bin/vivanco/de_DE/productList.html?catId=113&amp;showItems=1) here at [Ormigo](https://ormigo.com/), at least for those that are none Mac Users, who have the [Macally Ice Key](http://www.macally.com/spec/usb/input_device/icekey.html). I tried to buy one at Media Markt here in Germany for our latest developer, and sadly they were all out ... but one. Sadly that one had a missing key, and a missing fold-out-leg (for lack of a better word) at the bottom. I brought it in and later mailed Vivanco to ask whether there was an option to get the missing key and leg from them in any way, so we had a working product, because we like it so much.

Today in the mail came a new full keyboard with mouse, directly from Vivanco, no strings attached, or so it seems. This simply rocks! Great service and very fast response time. Vivanco will definitely move up in my choice of products when there is a decision to be made!
