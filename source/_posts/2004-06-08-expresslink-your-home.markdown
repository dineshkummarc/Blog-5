When I first saw some reports about Apple's [Airport Express](http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/) I was amazed. Then I learned that it doesn't dial in or anything and just does wireless, and I was far less than amazed. Than, also thinking about the $120 price tag, it started hitting me. This is the perfect thing to wire your home. In a sense, I am already using a thing like this, which is a simple small box from Lucent (if I remember correctly, it's just running running running) that has a network port and a WiFi card. My PC is attached to it to talk to the wireless gateway a few meters across the room. Apple's little toy would be the same thing. But for $120 I could buy another one that connected my stereo and potentially a harddisc video recorder, again across the room on the other wall. I could put my printer anywhere if I wanted to. You'll just have a few of those and connect them all over the place. You could sell that for conventions too, just plugging them in somewhere to create a network, possibly with a few printers attached too. There are probably other companies that have something very similar to this, but damn, doesn't Apple's version look damn cool again? ;)
