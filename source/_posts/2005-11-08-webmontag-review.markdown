[WebMontag](http://www.webmontag.de/) is over and I had time to let it go through my head a few times. I lean more to [Stefan's view](http://no-information.de/?p=554) than [Dirk's](http://www.olbertz.de/archives/000649.html) and I am looking forward to the next one. Remember that this was planned as a loose get together with a beamer available for those who want to present something. We might want to go deeper into Web 2.0 and an introduction session is a good idea, but as a start it rocked and the general idea seems to be to do it again beginning of January. But I am also looking forward to similar presentations again.

Thanks to Markus Schulte from [DOM](http://www.dom.de/) for providing the wiki and dropping in. He actually already did something similar with [Shanghai Club](http://www.shanghai-club.de/) in earlier internet times at Hallmackenreuther. The location seems to be made for something like this. As I later learned there is actually a bigger cellar location in there and a beamer cable goes from room to room so we could even have the presentation in both rooms, possibly with microphones in both rooms too for questions. This alone might be interesting. :)

For further discussions check out [Technorati tag webmontag](http://www.technorati.com/search/webmontag) or [the Flickr tag](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/webmontag/).

I for one will gladly help out again to make the next one happen.
