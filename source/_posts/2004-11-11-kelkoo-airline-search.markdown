Ok people, this is muchos coolos. I am trying to write this in a weird language so it gets some weight. I wanted to book a flight to Copenhagen some time ago and it was hard getting a good price. A friend told me that SAS had a good deal but they seemed to be booked out for the day I wanted to go. Then I remembered the [Kelkoo Flight Price Search](http://reisen.kelkoo.de/b/a/c_172201_fluge.html). Boy this thing kicks. You enter from where to where, when, a time preference, how many people and then search over all the airlines out there. Ok, all might be overdoing it a bit but it looks via Air Berlin, Air France, Basicq Air, Skytours, Condor, eBookers.de, Germanwings, hlx.com and Opodo, which pretty much covers it, except the ultra cheap maybe. But those you can cover with a few clicks because they mostly don't fly from or to where you want to go. :) I now have the SAS flight via eBookers.com at the price I wanted. Always good to remember that some bookers get packages of seats so if a flight is full somewhere, it might not be somewhere else, as seems to have been the case now. Copenhagen here I come.&amp;nbsp;
