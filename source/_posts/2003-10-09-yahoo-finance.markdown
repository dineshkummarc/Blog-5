I have to say that I really like the new Yahoo! Finance. The [quote pages](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NOK) are really nicely layed out and the content they have is very good. You can also download historical quotes to a spreadsheet, look who are the biggest holders, who are buying or selling. Lots of stuff I like to know all in one location. Congrats for the new site Yahoo!.
