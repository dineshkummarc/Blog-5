News.com has a [nice summary of the information arround the Google IPO](http://news.com.com/2100-1038-5198903.html?tag=cd.top), which gives a few details on who they will likely go public and/or now have internal fights about doing it or not. Investors would surely love to do it, but Google likely does not want to file.

This ties in with the fact that new rumors are starting about what Google will eventually become. They surely started as a search engine, no questions asked, but they might be moving into become the OS of choice for the future. I find things via google, I connect to friends via Orkut, I have my email at Gmail, I get questions answered with Google Answers, I read my news via Google News, I blog via Blogger (I don't but you get the point ;)) ... this list could very well be extended. 

If this is their goal, they would have to disclose that most likely. It would also make it a very much more viable business to invest in. AdSense is a pay-per-click network with some intelligence on top of it. Their rise or fall banks on getting higher CPM rates via their clicks on sites they need to buy traffic on. Porn sites are running their networks on a per sale affiliate basis, for a reason, because clicks can be faked.

I want them to go public, or rather, I just want to read the damn SEC filing. :)
