If I remember correctly, I heard about Google doing something in Print Search when Amazon was launching its new service that allowed people to [search within books](http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000947.php). Now I read [Heiko's post](http://www.hebig.com/archives/001760.shtml) about how Google is going into putting print titles online! Check out the [Google Print FAQ](http://print.google.com/print/faq.html) which has some further information. In general, Google gets prints online and profits via content targetted AdWords. We'll have to see how it works out and this thing is still in deep beta. To be watched.
