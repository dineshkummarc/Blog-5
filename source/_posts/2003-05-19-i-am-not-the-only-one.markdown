Checking my stats this morning I was wondering why I got so many hits from metafilter.com. Seems that somebody else, [Dr. Mike Pake](http://www.apu.ac.uk/appsci/psychol/staff/mpake.htm) to be exact, also got his Google Blanket: &lt;a title=&quot;web-based question answering | Metafilter&quot; href=&quot;http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/25843?&quot;&gt;Ionaut: web-based question answering&lt;/a&gt;. And same as me, he felt very nice about it because he didn't answer too many questions either. He also got a check from them though, same as myself again, for his contribution. I have to hand it to Google again (lots of agains here ;)), well done! And now you can also move the expense for the blankets and sending over to the marketing department ;) Thank you again!
