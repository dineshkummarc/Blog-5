&lt;P&gt;Well it's about time. I finally am coming around to posting an update. I actually told myself to do this daily but somehow always got an excuse not to or simply forgot :)

&lt;P&gt;What happened, hmmm... first of all my parents recently came over and stayed in a very nice hotel here in Aachen. The cool thing is that you had a wireless keyboard for the TV and could surf on there. This is of course nice but nothing I did not imagine before, and for close to 4 EUR for 15 minutes or something, the hotel will make good money on it too :)

&lt;P&gt;The cool thing though was that you can play Playstation games on the TV too. This includes a nice warning message when you want to do it telling you that if you have problems with flashing lights, fast movement and finger movement on close spaced you should not be doing it. 7 EUR per 30 minutes :) Just imagine the bill if parents leave their kids alone in the room for too long :)

&lt;P&gt;Next to that I have been to the belgium cost for a few days which was really nice. We just caught the very good weather for the 4 days that we were there and got a really good sunburn. It's strange, but it seems that you even at close to 26 I still did not learn that put on sunlotion is a good thing.

&lt;P&gt;We also had a very nice birthday party in cologne where I took some really nice shots with the digicam, 78 of those to be exact. I love this camera. I mean it is so much easier to just take a few pictures and you do not need to worry about the costs of developing the film. Very neat. And I learned a long time ago that I just want to take shots of people rather than some nice landscape shots. I did some artsy photography some time ago with lots of different cameras but by now I just want a camera that is small and that lets me take shots I will remember whereever I am.

&lt;P&gt;Other than that there is not really a lot to talk about. Live is going good, I like IMAP, got a new electrical tooth brush for getting the Deutsche Bank a new customer, its 5 am gain today and I am up way to long, met a very very nice people over the last few days that were very interesting to talk to, did a good TMA on my MBA course, still do not have my latest test results, started writing some nice articles, had a great welcomeback-birthday party for my brother, still would like to work in some foreign country, feel intrigued by the entire concept behind the Chaordic Age, thinking about getting an MP3 player, saw a nice way-to-expensive watch, thinking about getting a new laptop, loving life, feeling good, feet hurt due to party, need to go to bed, thinking about doing that now, stopping posting is a good idea, so that's that. I will see if I can do a bit more frequent updates which will be a lot more fun too :)
