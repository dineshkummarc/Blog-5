&lt;a title=&quot;My week at Stanford&quot; href=&quot;http://www.townhall.com/columnists/dennisprager/dp20030513.shtml&quot;&gt;Dennis Prager: My week at Stanford&lt;/a&gt;. He argues that universities are so isolated that it's the worst place to grow up. You eat on campus, you sleep on campus, you socialize on campus, you do everything on campus. The real world doesn't exist anymore. Maybe a bit over the top, sure, but worth to think about, especially considering that online universities are growing like crazy and they let you stay in the real world.
