I have been a member of [Google Answers](http://answers.google.com/answers/main) for some time now but sadly I did not have the time to give a lot of answers in my time as a researcher. I should probably take a look again and see if there is something where I can help. Why do I post this? Google just sent a check for the commission I got on the two answers I gave. $3.38. Not that I can do anything with it, as cashing it in would probably cost me more than $5, but it's great to see that they care and send over that amount of money. I actually like the service. You go in, ask a question, and lots of interesting people will give you an answer. These researchers can be rated similar to how it works on eBay. All in all an interesting system.
