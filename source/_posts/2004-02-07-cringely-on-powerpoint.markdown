Some interesting comments in [Cringely's latest collumn](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20040205.html) about PowerPoint and simply listening. 

*I give a lot of speeches, taking my biases and bad humor on the road to explain tech reality to all types of groups. And whether I am talking to 10 people or 3,700 (my personal best so far), I leave my notebook computer behind. You see it is my belief that people can read your slides or listen to what you are saying, but they canâ€™t do both things at the same time. And because it is easier to read than listen if you are age 15 or older, a good PowerPoint artist doesnâ€™t really have to say much at all. Thatâ€™s good for him or her, but bad for the audience. So I make them work. I talk too fast, tell too many stories, make too many bald conclusions, and generally put a hurt on the audience that they simply arenâ€™t used to. I make them think with me. And you know what happens? They love it. *

I do not stop hearing that PowerPoint presentations are bad at the moment so I am starting to wonder what the right way to go about this is. 

A nice finishing touch from his article:

*Which brings me to the most amazing event that happened to me this week. I called Warren Buffett, head of Berkshire Hathaway, and after Bill Gates, the richest man in the world. And he answered his own phone.*
