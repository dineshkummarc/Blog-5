Thanks to [loic's post](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2005/05/1gbps_home_inte.html) I now know that I could be surfing 1000 times faster for just 10 times the money in Hong Kong. That would  be 1Gbps! For $215 a month. Flat. More about this can be found [here](http://www.convergedigest.com/Bandwidth/newnetworksarticle.asp?ID=14545),  including the amount of Cisco routers they are buying. Then again ... what would I do with 1Gbps? It's like the edge becoming faster than the network, so you need the services at the edge too. It's not like I would get 1000 faster download of a big bittorrent file or something.
