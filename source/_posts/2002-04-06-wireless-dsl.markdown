Done. I just found out that my wireless residential gateway (802.11b) does ADSL after all and while there still seem to be some problems (it's pinging out and not getting anything back), it is working now. I will have to see if I get that problem settled too but it's not that important as it only does that at configuration. Thankfully it held the DSL config even though I had to push cancel on the testing phase. Cables removed from the floor and a BIG pile of cables and boxes at the telephone plug, I am not happy. Avonia will be happy that the cables are out of the room but she will be interested in what all the boxes at the phone plug do now. One for our DECT phones, one for the WaveLAN and one for DSL. The ISDN connector and DSL translator are hidden at least ;)
