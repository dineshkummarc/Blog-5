Well. It seems that I have just been given another year of complimentary membership of the [Motley Fool](http://www.fool.com/) [Community](http://boards.fool.com/), which is great. I actually complained the other day on the boards that &quot;The Land of Sisu&quot; (one board set up by a group of frequent posters on the NOK board) was actually almost the only thing that we keeping me here but that it was keeping me with full force. I consider these people my friends by now, even if there are some very heated discussions from time to time as currently about the potential war with Irak. Anyway. Just a few hours later, a mail, reproduced below, arrived from the wonderful TMFBogey, Fool Community Manager. Thanks a lot Bogey!!! Greatly appreciated and now TMF can be sure that I will be making a double effort to bring a good amount of value back to the TMF readers. Now that's long term customer thinking I would say.
