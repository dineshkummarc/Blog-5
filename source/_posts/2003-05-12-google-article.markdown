I seem to do that frequently but hey, this one is another great article about Google. &lt;a title=&quot;Forbes.com: All Eyes on Google&quot; href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/magazines/forbes/2003/0526/100.html?partner=newscom&quot;&gt;Forbes.com: All Eyes on Google.

And while I am at it, [Google Smackdown](http://www.onfocus.com/googlesmack/down.asp) rocks. Simpy ad two words to see which one is more popular. Thankfully love beats money.
