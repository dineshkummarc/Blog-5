Finally, the question that plagued us all has been answered. Compaq has taken the leap and put it into their FAQ. [The Answer](http://web14.compaq.com/falco/detail.asp?FAQnum=FAQ2859)! If this was a joke or not is unclear and in general I am not sure if it wasn't and there is a real need for that. If you can remove 3 hours of support calls per year with this, then you already saved a few hundred $ not factoring in opportunity costs.
