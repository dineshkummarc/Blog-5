... it's currently falling down on me. I have just clipped tons of posts that all are more interesting than the next, all talking about *exactly* what is on my mind, needing to be put into context. Affiliate Networks, AdSense, Marketing, Permission, Branding, APIs, WebServices, Connectedness, Blogging, Interconnectedness, Networks, Collaboration, Chaord, Semler, ...

Sometimes it just feels too much but boy is the opportunity big. Sometimes this stuff just baffles me. Now I will need to let the feeds go and concentrate on the urgent, as much as I would love to focus on the important. But i need to keep my brain from bursting. More on all this later, no worries I'm fine, just a bit on synaps overload ;)
