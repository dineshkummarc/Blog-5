This morning Nokia stock was at something like 14 EURs and I had a [ClickOptions](http://www.clickoptions.com/) bet going on that it would reach 15.30 EURs by tomorrow. I actually bought that when Nokia still was at arround 15 EURs beginning/mid last month. What happens now? Nokia raises their forecast for the forth quarter and the stock jumps 14% to almost 16 EURs. I invested 40 EURs, thought I lost them and now I am getting 100 EURs. Now that's fun :)
