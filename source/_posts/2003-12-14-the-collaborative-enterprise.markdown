Loic le Meur got me thinking again, about the perfect company, the one thing that will rule them all without everyone being ruled over. The idea is to have something where everyone wants to work at, which ties in with having a shared goal, which ties in with Dee Hock's Birth of the Chaordic Age.

Loic's post entitled: [U-blog / loic / &quot;Open Source is everywhere, software is just the beginning&quot;](http://www.u-blog.net/loic/note/57133), has some great links in it about where things might be moving and what might work. 

He starts by linking to a Wired Article entitled [Open Source Everywhere](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.11/opensource.html), which has some very good parts. Even the start, where a new medical device was built with the help of ThinkCycle, which links together people with different backgrounds on projects. Imagine how much knowledge we have in this world already, just in disciplines that are not linked... yet.

The 5 page article has some interesting ideas in it, littered with good examples. It looks at the Open Source movement trying to see where it might work in other businesses. 

Loic has some more stuff and links on the entire open source system. I personally think it is just a starting point. The open source system works because it is open. That's what will work in a company too. Have it open. The thing is sharing everything openly needs the right surrounding but you can work on it. 

I don't think everything needs to go open source, far from it, but everything should get the idea, and be it only internally. You set the barriers, then let freidom reign.

I still have lots of thinking to do about the perfect enterprise and it will likely never happen, but there must be something close.
