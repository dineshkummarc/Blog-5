Want to know how Google's PageRank really works? [Here](http://dbpubs.stanford.edu:8090/pub/1999-66) you can find the 1999 paper about the system. Other interesting items include one on [extrapolation](http://dbpubs.stanford.edu:8090/pub/2003-16), something called [BlockRank](http://dbpubs.stanford.edu:8090/pub/2003-17) and [adaptive PageRank](http://dbpubs.stanford.edu:8090/pub/2003-26), all items that are said to potentially enhance Google's performance. It seems that the PageRank can currently take several days to calculate based on the several million pages in Google's system and these new additions would help bring new features to Google (like your personal PageRank in relation to what you like) by bringing more speed. Or so [they said in this article](http://www.golem.de/0305/25548.html) (german).
