&quot;It has long been known...&quot; 
I didn't look up the original references 

&quot;A definite trend is evident...&quot; 
This data is practically meaningless 

&quot;Of great theoretical and practical importance...&quot; 
Interesting to me 

&quot;Three of the samples were chosen for detailed study...&quot; 
The results of the others didn't make any sense 

&quot;Typical results are shown...&quot; 
The best results are shown 

&quot;The most reliable results are those obtained by Jones...&quot; 
He was my graduate assistant 

&quot;It is believed that...&quot; 
I think 

&quot;It is generally believed that...&quot; 
A couple of other guys think so, too 

&quot;It is clear that much additional work will be required before a complete understanding of the phenomenon occurs...&quot; 
I don't understand it 

&quot;Correct within an order of magnitude...&quot; 
Wrong 

&quot;It is hoped that this study will stimulate further investigation in this field... &quot;
This is a lousy paper, but so are all the others on this miserable topic 

&quot;A careful analysis of obtainable data...&quot; 
Three pages of notes were obliterated when I knocked over my beer 

&quot;Reasonable order of magnitude...&quot; 
Wild guess 

&quot;Non-trivial problem...&quot; 
It doesn't work, but if we throw enough money at it, something's bound to happen
