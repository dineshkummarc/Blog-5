Interesting [interview with Six Apart's Vice President of Business Development Anil Dash](http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/10/14/HNanildash_1.html). Second time I read that MovableType (albeit a special version) is the content management system of [About.com](http://www.about.com/). Some other interesting stuff like pushing blogs into corporations and what might be needed to do that. Good read.
