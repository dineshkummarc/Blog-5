Ahhh... it is nice and silent here today. Yesterday we had band on the market all day and from time to time it can really drive you nuts. At least it is over now.

On another note I finished summing up the 400 pages of Managing People module in the management course to 40 pages. There is a lot of detail still in there which I want to have rather than having less pages and there is still some sidebar space to write stuff down and all in nice big letters. Me is happy. I also learned a great deal in the process as always and now I need to revise a bit more until the test on Tuesday.

On top of that we just finished the redesign of our adult statistics service which we sold to another company and are now running for them. It looks really cool. It's also growing nicely at the moment and thanks to the deal we will have a lot more exposure soon which means that it will grow even more.
