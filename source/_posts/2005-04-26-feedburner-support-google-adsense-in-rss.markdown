The FeedBurner folks just [posted](http://www.burningdoor.com/feedburner/archives/001146.html) that they will support Google's current trials of adding AdSense Ads to your RSS Feeds directly via FeedBurner. It's still in closed trials but will get out once Google has finished those at which time the support will be in FeedBurner. Kick Ass! Congrats people. Google is building a new market there, now like with [their CPM Image Ads move](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/04/google_adsense_.html).
