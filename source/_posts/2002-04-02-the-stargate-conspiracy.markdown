I just finished the above book, in my holiday, and I really like it. It's not so much a book establishing a conspiracy or really knowing that there is one but what they are doing is giving you an imense background (and several new books for my wishlist while they are at it) about things going on around gods, egypt, aliens and more. I would really like to read &quot;The Keys of Enoch&quot; now but sadly I would have to order it from their web site and I am not really into giving them my name and address ;)

But if you are looking for a good research paper, which is more of what I would say this book is, on things going, or not going on in Egypt, people who said they talked to &quot;The Nine&quot; or other things then go for it. It's very good.

&quot;I am the beginning. I am the end. I am the emissary. But the original time that I was on the Planet Earth was 34,000 of your years ago. I am in balance. And when I say 'I' - I mean because I am an emissary of the Nine. It is not I, but it is the group ... We are nine principles of the Universe, yet together we are one.&quot; - Tom, channeled through Phyllis Schlemmer (The Stargate Conspiracy)
