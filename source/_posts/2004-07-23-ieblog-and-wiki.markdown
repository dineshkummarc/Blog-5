Microsoft is really opening up and I do love it. See it as very good marketing if you don't want to acknowledge the basic power of working like this. So check out the &lt;a title=&quot;IEBlog&quot; href=&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/ie&quot;&gt;IEBlog&lt;/a&gt; and even more amazing the [IE Wiki](http://channel9.msdn.com/wiki/default.aspx/Channel9.InternetExplorerFeedback)! Edit away people! I really hate this but I had big talks about Wikis, Blogging and resulting changes in the media landscape at lunch just now. This stuff always gets me all excited. I need to calm down again now ;)
