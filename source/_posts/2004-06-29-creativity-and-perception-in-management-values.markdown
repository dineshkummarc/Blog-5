Here we start at culture, in which national values do have a large effect. These are underpinned by four dimensions (Hofstede): Power-distance, Uncertainty-avoidance, Individualism/collection, Masculinity/feminity. This needs to be kept in mind when going to work in different countries, as these differences can break apart an executive when they want to work like they did in their local country.





[Here is a wonderful site listing Hofstede's country clusters](http://laika.pop.indiana.edu/abstracts/BUS/D301w/2000-10-01/lesson1/hofstedeChart/hofstedeCharts.htm). In broad terms, european countries are lower on the power-distance, pushing more power down to the individual. Latin, Asian, Arab and Developing Countries are more collective, while Anglos and northern Europeans are more individuals. Nothern europe has a more feminine side, with Germany falling out of that picture. 

In chinese research, they found similar dimension as Hofstede:
- integration = collectivism
- human-heartedness = femininity
- moral discipline = high power-distance
Their fourth dimension is called &quot;Confucian work dynamism&quot;, implying a forward-looking type, with stable relationships and shame in relation to not support order or move against it.

&lt;B&gt;Implications&lt;/B&gt;

An implication is that different cultures mean that different things are excepted, like higher power-distance looking for managers to make decisions. French only trust their senior staff (graduated from grandes ecoles) but German organizations rely on expertise in junior employees. German's see the organization as a well oiled machine, sticking to rules and procedures, while Anglo companies will rely on communication to resolve any problems.

An english manager in a french company might feel very uncomfortable in relation to the prevailing idea that management is more competent than his subordinates.

Culture also has an effect on economic development. Germans for example are good at building infrastructure, while Americans invent and Japanese innovate. 

Social capital, closely linked to trust within society, is cited by Fukuyama as very important to economic success.
