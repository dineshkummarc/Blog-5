Interesting little article by Kasparov about his game against Deep Blue, by IBM, and now Deep Junior. It's especially interesting to note that he sees a very scientifc challenge and mind game in the way it is working now, while Deep Blue was nothing more than a PR stunt. He explains why. &lt;a title=&quot;OpinionJournal - Extra&quot; href=&quot;http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110003081&quot;&gt;OpinionJournal - Extra&lt;/a&gt;
