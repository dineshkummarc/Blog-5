I think that [Furl](http://www.furl.net/) will eventually improve the content of my blog. Why? At the moment I am more or less blogging what interests me, including short blurbs on things that I read. This might puts ideas and comments in the same blog as simple reminders, which are likely less interesting to some people. Now those reminders will be furled and not blogged and for those interested they can subscribe to my furl rss feed.

In general, furl can be seen as a link blog, especially with the option to comment, and this link blog thing is growing on me.
