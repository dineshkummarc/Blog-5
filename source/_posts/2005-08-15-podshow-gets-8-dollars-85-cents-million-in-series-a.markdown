So Podcasting is starting to take off, obviously after iTunes has support for it now. As seen &lt;a title=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;http://hosting.mansellgroup.net/enablemail/ThomsonNewLetter/HostedWires/NewsLetters/Aug10.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that [Podshow](http://podshow.com/), co-created by [Adam &quot;Podfather&quot; Curry](http://curry.com), has received lots of money from some heavy hitters.

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://hosting.mansellgroup.net/enablemail/ThomsonNewLetter/HostedWires/NewsLetters/Aug10.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little that gets Valley girls and boys as hot and bothered as when an Internet company gets funded by both Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers. So it's worth noting that the iconic venture shops have participated in an $8.85 million Series A round for PodShow Inc., according to a regulatory filing. For an added bonus, both John Doerr and Ray Lane have taken board seats, joining both Jerry Newman of Bear Stearns and omnipresent angel investor Ram Shriram (Google, Plaxo, Zazzle, etc.), who is representing shareholder Harris MyCFO Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Congratulations guys! Very nice indeed and looking forward to really seening podcasting grow big now.
