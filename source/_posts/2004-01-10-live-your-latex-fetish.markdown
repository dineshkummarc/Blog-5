I was simply looking at my TypePad Stats (based on browsing behaviour I'd say the Googlebot has arrived after I redirected my old site), when I found [Caffeineslinger](http://caffeineslinger.typepad.com/), another TypePad blog. What caught my attention was his [&lt;i&gt;More Creepy Stuff from Japan&lt;/i&gt;](http://caffeineslinger.typepad.com/les/2003/12/more_creepy_stu.html) post about somebody who, obviously due to a sexual latex fetish judging by some of the pics, is painting girls one colour and then even pours that colour over them.
&lt;br /&gt;[&lt;img alt=&quot;yellow.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/yellow-thumb.jpg&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/yellow.jpg)
&lt;br /&gt;
While it is not something I can personally get sexually excited about, it is an interesting picture. The others are a bit more creepy, but the yellow one is nice. There is a [black](http://village.infoweb.ne.jp/~fwiz4610/manon/miv08.htm) and [colourful](http://village.infoweb.ne.jp/~fwiz4610/manon/miv04.htm) image series available.
