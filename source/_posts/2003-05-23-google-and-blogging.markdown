This is going on and on doesn't it, and me, I just don't stop either. I can't sorry. This thing is just too interesting. Here is a nice article from the Guardian about the current discussion. Here a quote:

&lt;I&gt; Weblogs, by their nature (simple web pages with content that often relies, for context and richness, on numerous links, updated regularly) are bound to attract the attention of Google - a search that works partly by freshness, party by analysing page structure (the simpler the better) and mainly by looking at the links within those pages.&lt;/I&gt;
