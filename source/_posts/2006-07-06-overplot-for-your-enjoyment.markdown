[Paul Kedrosky pointed me](http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2006/06/28/hooked_on_overp.html) to [Overplot](http://persistent.info/overplot/?), a mashup of [Overheard in New York](http://www.overheardinnewyork.com/) and Google Maps. In general useless but fun to surf through and a wonderful time waster.
