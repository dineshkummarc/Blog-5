I [posted about Amazon S3](http://blog.thylmann.net/2006/03/amazon_changes_.html) when it launched and am starting to get more excited about the platform as the days pass. Now I found an article by Adrian Holovaty, the guy behind [Chicago Crime](http://chicagocrime.org/) entitled [How I'm using Amazon S3 to serve media files](http://www.holovaty.com/blog/archive/2006/04/07/0927). In it he explains how he has moved all his static files over to Amazon S3, partly because it frees up his Apache to only handle the dynamic files and second because the $0.20 per GB is really cheap. Just ask about Akamai prices.
