Now this could be fun. Most digital cameras give the pictures you take some special name including a number. The first picture I took with my Ixus was IMG_0001. A sony's Mavica first image would be MVC-001. Of course, if you do over X photos the number might come again, but ... it is likely that if that's the filename, then that's the first foto. Now [tage a look](http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;safe=off&amp;q=IMG_0002&amp;btnG=Google+Search) what were the first photos of other people with an Ixus (or camera that saves IMG_XXXX as filename.) :)
