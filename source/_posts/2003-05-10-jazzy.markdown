I have just returned from a jazz concert. It was more of a local friends thing, with free entry, free drinks and free food and a donation box. We have seen a good for fun band, which was more bluesy though and then another local pro jazz band came up which was rather good though.

The most interesting thing was the venue though. They were playing within the in-development production line for a future Ford Focus (or whatever it will be called) steering system. ... I am looking forward to seeing that car when it comes out, just to say ... &quot;I've been at a party next to the production system of this car's steering system when it was being developed.&quot; ;)
