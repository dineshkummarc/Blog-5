BusinessWeek has [an article](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_47/b3909001_mz001.htm) about Eddie Lampert and how he might be the next Warren Buffett. I have to admit that his progress seems stunning but as they not in the article, there is still some way to go until he can call himself the next Warren Buffett. His ESL Investments hedge fund and KMart might be two things to watch. On a side not, [MSD Capital](http://www.msdcapital.com/) is mentioned in the article. It's a company founded in 1998 to manage Michael Dell's money. They are now 70 people. :)
