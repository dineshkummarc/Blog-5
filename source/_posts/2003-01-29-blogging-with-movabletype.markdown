It's done. I installed [MovableType](http://www.movabletype.org/) and I am loving it. This is so wonderful to use and optimize and I really like having all of it in my own database. Sure, [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/) is a very nice service and all, and I liked having it, but this is nicer. I really like the design, the templates system, management interface and capabilities like an RDF feed so other people can look at updates in my blog. Now I need to get my old LJ posts imported here and I am happy.

Next up would be getting the design done. At the moment I am just using a normal template and actually like it. I need to build it around my site though which will change once again. I have been using Typo3 as a content management system at [oliver.thylmann.com](http://oliver.thylmann.com/) but want to move away from that to build my own system. Sure, then I should actually build my own blogging system but lets now overdo it please.

That's it for now though. More coming soon. :)
