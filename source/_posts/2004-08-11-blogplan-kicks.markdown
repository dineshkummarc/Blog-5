I already had a GeoIP system on my blog once, but [Blogplan](http://www.blogplan.de/) beats this hands down! What they do is allow you to list you blog in relation to where you live, at least for some cities. The cool thing is that they are doing it with the Metro/Tram/Bus plans of those cities, meaning that you just give the nearest station to where you live. This can then be used for blogger meetings. I just added myself to &lt;a title=&quot;koeln.blogplan.de&quot; href=&quot;http://koeln.blogplan.de/?site=1&quot;&gt;koeln.blogplan.de I suggest you go to [Blogplan](http://www.blogplan.de/) and add yourself to the city you live in, if it is listed. Thanks to [Nico's post](http://www.lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=452) for the pointer!
