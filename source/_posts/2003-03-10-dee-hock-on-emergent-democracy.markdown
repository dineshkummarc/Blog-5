Joi Ito has posted &lt;a title=&quot;Joi Ito's Web: An email from Dee Hock about the emergent democracy paper&quot; href=&quot;http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/10/an_email_from_dee_hock_about_the_emergent_democracy_paper.html#004383&quot;&gt;an email from Dee Hock about the emergent democracy paper&lt;/a&gt; he wrote. You can find the original paper [here](http://joi.ito.com/static/emergentdemocracy.html). 

I loved Dee Hock's book &quot;Birth of the Chaordic Age&quot;. In it, Dee Hock lays out a possible new way to build/run/maintain organisations. I can only suggest reading it.

As for emergent democracy, I still have to fully twist my head arround it.
