Oliver of agenturblog [pointed me](http://www.agenturblog.de/archives/2005/09/rollyo-bau-dir-eine-eigene-suchmaschine.php) to [Rollyo](http://www.rollyo.com). It's a very interesting new project built upon, so it seems, the Yahoo! search engine API. The idea is that you can choose up to 25 different web sites to search, and Rollyo builds a special search box for you that searches only those sites. I already built a special box that only searches my own sites, which is very nice indeed. They have a good interface too. Check them out.
