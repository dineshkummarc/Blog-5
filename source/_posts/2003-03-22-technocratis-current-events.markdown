Sifry has &lt;a title=&quot;Sifry's Alerts: Technorati's Current Events&quot; href=&quot;http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000251.html&quot;&gt;developed Technorati's Current Events, a page which puts the thoughts from 150000 blogs from the last 2 hours on one page. This will greatly help those who want to know what is currently being written about the war in Irak. By reading something from this broad base of sources, propaganda is likely to be unsuccessful, or at least less successful. You can find the page [here](http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/currentevents.html).
