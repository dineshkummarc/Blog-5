Watch closely there, I said *G-mail* not Gmail. :) G-mail is a german service that now went into beta. The people behind it from [Giersch Ventures](http://www.giersch.com/) actually sued Google because they had registered G-mail before Google and hence people who register for Gmail (Google's) in Germany now, will get an email address @googlemail.com :)

Well now G-mail has gone into beta and it's actually an interesting service. They are only online in the small town of [Itzehoe](http://www.itzehoe.de/) and offer *Hyprid Mail*, meaning that you can get all your mail in your inbox, including snail mail, even making 1 cent per snail mail delivered electronically. It will be interesting to see if it works out.
