These posts about RSS might be getting really boring for some but I still think that most people out there and many web sites as well are not really seeing the full implications of this. I am actually starting to wonder if Atom is not going to win as it allows for so much more, but that's besides the point. 

Frank Bajak from AP has a great article you can see [here](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=528&amp;e=1&amp;u=/ap/20040227/ap_on_hi_te/deliver_me_web) which shows the weight behind it all.

In relation to blogging and rss, M&amp;A has arrived in the field with [Tocows acquirering BlogRolling.com](http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/040227/nyf090_1.html)! 

*BlogRolling.com presently tracks over 500,000 weblog links for more than 32,000 users. Each day BlogRolling.com serves over 1.5 million blogrolls to users of all major weblog platforms. BlogRolling.com is a blogroll management service; a list of links that a website or weblog owner can include in their web pages as a public list of bookmarks.*

I am personally publishing my blogroll via [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/), which I use as my aggregator anyway.
