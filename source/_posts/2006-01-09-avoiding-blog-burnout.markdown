Ken Yarmosh, the editor behind [the Corante Web Hub](http://web.corante.com/) posted on his own blog about [7 Ways to Avoid Blogging Burnout](http://www.technosight.com/blog/7-ways-to-avoid-blogging-burnout/) and I agree and don't agree at the same time. It really depends on whether you see all of this as a business or just as a way to have fun and express yourself.

With Ken's suggestions you will be organized and probably will being out really good content, but it does sound a bit like work from time to time, which blogging really can be.

But there is an alternate idea. Have fun. If you don't blog, don't. Your subscribers via RSS will mostly stay as they will be updated on a new post anyway. Just post what you want to be saying and bring your true voice online. From time to time I don't blog for days, and I did stop for weeks even, but I still survived and I do still have fun blogging. If it stops being fun, then stop doing it. Sure, it's burnout, but hey, who the hell cares what you call it. This is not your job. Sometimes there is just too much going on and maybe you are just not the type to do it.

There are some very good points in the post though, as is to be expected by Ken. Always carry a notebook for example. Moleskines rock! Think before you post (but not too much, it stops being authentic.) And yes, you don't blog to live, you live to blog ... emmm... ok, scratch that ;)
