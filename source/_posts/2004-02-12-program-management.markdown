Chris Pratley wrote a very good [post on Program Management](http://weblogs.asp.net/chris_pratley/archive/2004/02/09/70474.aspx) and what it really is. It really makes me want to do this even more, being the buffer between IT and Marketing/Sales. I took on the current position exactly because of this. I love both worlds but I am neither a sales guy nor a developer. I get along with both of them really well, love technology, love business (building a foundation via an MBA here) and hate it when the two sides clash for the little reason of miscommunication. This part is great:

*I'm not sure where this saying came from originally, but one way to describe PMs is that they not only &quot;pick up and run with the ball, they go find the ball&quot;. That really defines the difference between &quot;knowing what to do and doing it&quot;, and &quot;not knowing what to do, but using your own wits to decide what to do, then doing it&quot;. That means as a PM you are constantly strategizing and rethinking what is going on to find out if there is something you are missing, or the team is missing. Youâ€™re also constantly deciding what is important to do, and whether action needs to be taken. The number of such decisions is staggering.*

Totally 100% agreed. And I also agree with Chris that one great thing about a holiday is not deciding what to do. Especially not something that might come back and haunt you :)

Thanks for the post [Chris](http://weblogs.asp.net/chris_pratley/).
