Ok, you need to speak german to read [this](http://e-61.blogspot.com/) but it is hilarious. A guy has bought a Nokia E61 some time ago, which is advertised as being Blackberry capable. This is said so on the site, in the documentation, on the package, in the press... well. It seems that the thing is not blackberry capable out of the box but needs special software. This software, so it seems, is nowhere to download though. The tale is now going over several weeks, as far as planting small trees in front of the german Nokia HQ. :)
