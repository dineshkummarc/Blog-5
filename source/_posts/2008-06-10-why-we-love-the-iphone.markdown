That is really the question. I presume &lt;a title=&quot;T-Mobile&quot; rel=&quot;homepage&quot; href=&quot;http://www.t-mobile.net/&quot;&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; in Germany will launch their prices soon. I would presume the 8GB version going for 49, 99, 149, 199 EURs and the 16GB for 149, 199, 249, 299 EURs dependent on contract, which is actually already the case for the 8GB version. And don't come with me with the idea that his Steveness said that they will all go for $199, $299 max, because the 8GB would be cheaper, and the 16GB too, just being more expensive with other contract. I am actually wondering if &lt;a title=&quot;Apple Inc.&quot; rel=&quot;homepage&quot; href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; did not let T-Mobile in Germany try out the rebate system to see what would happen, and at 99 EURs the 8GB version probably sold very well. (Update: might be wrong. see [here](http://uk.techcrunch.com/2008/06/10/o2-confirms-free-iphone-deal-and-more/) for UK prices which start with free. My 2nd Assumption, subtract 100 EURs from all my above prices.)

Anyway, back to the subject why we love the iPhone. I love Michael's post &quot;[I am a Member of the Cult of iPhone](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/10/i-am-a-member-of-the-cult-of-iphone/)&quot; where he said some very valid things. I actually presume the Apple brand managers want to kiss his feet. First quote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Apple is about elegance, design, and potential, and we love them for it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Especially the potential is an important term here. But on to and another one:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I love the iPhone for the same reason I love technology in general, and loved Disneyland as a child - it drives my imagination and makes me wonder what kind of magic to expect next. Also, it just works.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This instantly made &lt;a title=&quot;Maslow's hierarchy of needs&quot; rel=&quot;wikipedia&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.thylmann.net/2003/04/03/understanding-motivation/&quot;&gt;Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs&lt;/a&gt; pop into my head, a theory about how people are motivated. It splits down our needs in different levels, and I'll try to look at them from the perspective of a phone. Remember that the first level has to be fulfilled for the second to have any effect.
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; Physical Needs: (e.g. working conditions, housing, wage, ...) The phone has to work. There choosing a good carrier helped because you have superior voice quality here at T-Mobile for example.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Safety: (security in job, health insurance, ...) We want it to work in a year still and don't want to think that we made the wrong choice. Apple made sure they are seen as in the forefront of technology. And remember this is all touchy feely, because it might lack a video camera mode but most people don't use that yet.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Social: (sports, parties, open communications, ...) They made the device into something to talk about. It's so flashy that you want to carry it around and show it to your friends.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Esteem: (Regular positive feedback, prestigious job titles, ...) I feel good about myself, because there is nothing better out there, and it just freaking works, and fast at that.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Self-actualisation: (challenging, encouraging, can structure own work) This is actually what is coming with the next version, iPhone 2.0. It allows you to tailor your phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Now the thing is that &lt;a title=&quot;Nokia&quot; rel=&quot;homepage&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nokia.com/&quot;&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt; understood that self-actualisation bit from the getgo, and physical needs and security where covered at all time. The problem is that the world changed and now security includes &quot;can I watch videos on it&quot; or &quot;can I surf the web with it&quot; and the iPhone just feels more like it can do that. On top of that Apple is the clear Master at the Social and Esteem part of it all. Nokia is now crumbling because they are missing the middle. I am still holding on to my shares tightly because they move huge volumes and will continue to do so, but for the digerati, a fully well shaped motivational pyramid is important and I want mine to be nicely shaped too.

update 2: See [here](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/iphone_20_big_in_bubbleland.php) for some verey good comments. The features as such are not revolutionary. Yes, the Nokia N95 that I have in my pocket can do more than the iPhone can. The problem is that many aren't there as a need but as something to brag about and that is not something that you can do with the N95.
