The 13 year old Makenzie is on a mission to make every foster child in the united states happy. By now, she has collected over $50.000 and sent a duffel bag, a stuffed animal and a note to 28000 of them! 

&lt;I&gt;&quot;I want you to always know that you are loved, especially by me. And always remember to be positive, polite and never give up. Lve Your Friend, Makenzie&quot;&lt;/I&gt;

Wow. I bow down before you girl!
