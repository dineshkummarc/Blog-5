This was the title in WIRED about what Nick Denton is currently doing. What he is doing is coming up with ideas for blogs, having them designed and then paying an editor to handle the site. It's an interesting concept, even though I do not know if it will ever be profitable. Actually, I doubt it, but it largely depends on the return of the advertising industry in termf of revenue. You can read more about the current sites [here on his blog](http://www.nickdenton.org/archives/001731.html).
