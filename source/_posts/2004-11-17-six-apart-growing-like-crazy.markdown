Boy oh boy. I know growth can be tough first hand. [This article](http://www.marketwatch.com/news/yhoo/story.asp?source=blq/yhoo&amp;siteid=yhoo&amp;dist=yhoo&amp;guid=%7B9AD59DB0%2DF140%2D4041%2D99A5%2D57E9A0D6E492%7D) on Marketwatch is giving some detail on Six Apart's growth. Remember that their growth on the employee side. They started with a hosted blogging service some 13 months ago.

*Back then, the company was all of nine people stuffed into an office in San Mateo, Calif. Now, Six Apart has 51 full-time staffers, 31 of whom are relocating to new offices in San Francisco. Six Apart claims 1 million Weblogs have been created using its products. The company would not say how many active accounts it has.*

Ok, that staff size is amazing but it also puts back into my head something about blogging. Keeping a corporate blog and keeping your employees blogging will likely help integrate people faster because people know who to talk to. Integrating people is really hard in any case and as I know from first hand experience, growing can be really painful. They will have to get down to business on adding blogs. If this is a hyper growth thing then free blogs are just an important equation in this. Then again, free blogs don't add to the bottom line and their pay model might pay up. If you believe that an average employee costs $100.000 per year, just to take a reasonably high number, will need on average some 1000 accounts to be refinanced if there were no costs next to hosting. The numbers if probably more at 5000 to 10000 and that's already a steep number. 50 Employees are then something like 50.000 blogs. Even putting that at 100.000 it might really work out. Congratulations people!
