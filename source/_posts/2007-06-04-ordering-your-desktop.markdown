I lived with a lot of clutter on my Desktop. It's just that stuff ends up there somehow and it never tends to leave. Now I found the [Five Steps to a Kinkless Desktop](http://www.kinkless.com/article/kinkless_desktop) and I think I am moving into Desktop Heaven. The article comes from the guy behind [kGTD](http://www.kinkless.com/kgtd) which I am using already. It's a collection of scripts for [OmniOutliner Pro](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/) that gives you a very good Getting Things Done tool. Now I am all Kinked.

I already have [OmniGraffle Pro](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/) and now it seems that the [OmniGroup](http://www.omnigroup.com) is working on [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/) which will as it looks replace my kGTD once it comes out. The tool seems to be the ultimate GTD tool in itself and I signed up for the mailing list and hope to get access to the next early release soon. It just has a few nice things like nested contexts that I really would love to have.
