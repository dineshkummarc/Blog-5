I have been using [RSSCalendar.com](http://www.rsscalendar.com/) for several days now, and I am getting used to it now. It's a free only calendar application that is published via RSS feeds and allows you to invite some people that you can then share your calendar with. John Pacchetti, who is the man behind the service, really had a very nice idea with this and I had a wonderful eMail conversation with him in the last few days. There are some things that the service still needs, but I am positive that John is onto them and am looking forward to seeing them implemented. I suggest you try out the service, espcially if you are interested in RSS and where it could be taken. I orginally got the link from [Jeff Nolan's post about it](http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2004/08/rss_calendar.html) and Nick Bradbury [mentioned](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/08/rsscalendar.html) that the service has no been [covered by CNet](http://news.com.com/RSS+gets+down+to+business/2100-1012_3-5311747.html?tag=nefd.top) which should give him some good exposure. Congratulations John!
