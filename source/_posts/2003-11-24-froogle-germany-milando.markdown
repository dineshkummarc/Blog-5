There seems to be something close to Google's Froogle, their shopping search engine, available in Germany. The site is called [Milando](http://milando.de/index.php) and might be useful for some christmas shopping. :) (Thanks to [heiko](http://www.hebig.com/archives/001696.shtml) for pointing me to [nico's post](http://lumma.de/mt/archives/000725.html#000725) about it :))
