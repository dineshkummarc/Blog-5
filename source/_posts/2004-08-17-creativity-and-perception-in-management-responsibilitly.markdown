We now had economics concern. We all agreed that environmental ones are important too. So what about the social ones? This is something that will grow of importance and boy did I have some fights at residential school about this. What is more important, making money or that the company and the employees share their values? Might some values be more important than money?





Charles Handy and Rosabeth Moss Kanter seem to argue that people will opt to work for those companies whos values they share. So what is a company to do?


* donate
* allow staff to volunteer
* social marketing
* ethical investment
* social auditing


... this is what the book says. I'd say Google is pretty close to it: &quot;Don't do bad.&quot;  That's that really. Microsoft matches a donation by their employees with the same amount if I am not mistaken. I'd say that simply doing the right thing is important. Having a leader you want to follow. Especially the really good people will be able to decide where they want to work and many of them will not only make their decisions based on money. And this is a real monetary thing on why to be socially resposible. The other thing is that it's just the damn right thing to do!
