In this article, Mintzberg argues that &quot;parameters of organizational design should logically configure into internally consistent groupings.&quot;

There are **six basic parts** of an organization:


* operating core: here production happens
* strategic apex: tom management
* middle line: middle management
* technostructure: e.g. analysts that design systems, processes, etc...
* support staff: support outside of operating workflow
* ideology: halo of beliefs and traditions.


There are also 6 basic co-ordination mechansims
- mutual adjustment (among the core, people coordinate among themselves, only means under extremely difficult circumstances)
- direct supervision (from the top to the core)
- standardization of work processes (by technostructure to core)
- standardization of outputs (not what is done but what the result will be)
- standardization of skills (the worker is standardized)
- standardization of norms (common set of beliefs)

There are some design parameters that can be changed. These fall into different categories:
(individual positions)
- job specialisation
- behaviour formalisation
- training
- indoctrination
(superstructure to knit it together)
- unit grouping
- unit size
(lateral linkages)
- planning (ahead of time) and control (afterwards) systems
- liaison devices
(decision-making systems)
- vertical decentralisation
- horizontal decentralisation

Next we have the **situational factors**, which influence the choice of the design parameters and vice versa:
1. Age and size:
- the older, the more formalized the behaviour
- the larger, the more formalized the behaviour
- the larger, the more elaborate the structure
- the larger, the larger the average unit
- the structure reflects the age of founding of the industry


* Technical systems:
* the more regulating, the more formalized and bureaucratic the work
* the more complex the more elaborate the administrative structure
* the automation of the operating core moved a bureaucratic administrative structure into an organic one
* Environment
: The more dynamic the more organic the structure
* the more complex, the more decentralized the structure
* the more diversified the markets, the more propensity to split into market-based units
* extreme hostility drives centralized structure temporarily
* disparity in environment call for differentiated work constellations
* Power
* the greater external control the more centralized and formalized the structure
* power needs of individuals foster centralized structures
* fashion favors the structure of the day


This leads us to six basic **configurations** (Table 12.1 has a great summary here)
- the simple structure: just some operating core and top management
- the machine bureaucracy: more elaborate administration with technostructure and support.
- professional bureaucracy: standardization of skill rather than processes and hence a bigger support than technostructure
- divisionalized form: several sup-structures
- adhocracy: this is for companies that need project structures, creative teams dominated by a pull to collaborate.
- the missionary: pull to evangelize, loose divisions of labour, little specialization, often very young company
