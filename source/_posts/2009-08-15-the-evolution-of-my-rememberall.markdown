&lt;p&gt;I am a technology addict, and I love trying new things. One thing that has always been important to me is how they all work together to form a greater whole. Above that, some weeks ago, together with my Squarespace move, I decided to not have personal servers anymore. Not sure how long this will hold, but I will try. Servers at home are excluded, and ... a never mind, you get the point. E.g. I love [Noserub](http://noserub.com/), but I will run it hosted by somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to the main point. My Rememberall. There is so much stuff going on around you that you really need an infrastructure to keep yourself sane enough. It is probably easiest to understand how I use things by going through the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A) E-Mail:&lt;/strong&gt; To start of I check my mail, yeah, I still do, and make sure only stuff I have to answer remains. Things I can answer now, are answered, things that I want to answer later remain, and things that are ToDo's are forwarded to my private E-Mail address at [Remember The Milk](http://rememberthemilk.com/) so they end up becoming (unsorted) ToDo's. All else is archived directly through a Keyboard shortcut (thanks Mail Act-On). I say archived because all mails are in GMail and never deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B) RSS:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, RSS is not dead for me yet. I use Google Reader and am very happy with it. I always read the &quot;All Items&quot; list, navigating through keyboard shortcuts. Especially on the iPhone, where I use Byline which syncs with Reader, I mark things as Favorite that I want to closer read later. If I already know that I like it but want to share it with the world, I &quot;share&quot; it potentially with note, which is automatically ending up in my Tumblr Blog at [stuff.thylmann.net](http://stuff.thylmann.net/).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C) Twitter:&lt;/strong&gt; Some here, I use favorites to mark things I want to read later. I am switching clients on the Desktop but on the iPhone I end up using Tweetie, even though I tried several others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D) [Read it Later](http://readitlaterlist.com/):&lt;/strong&gt; This wonderful service actually is used to add anything that I want to read later while in the browser. It includes an iPhone app that syncs via Nocat and hence I have lots of stuff to read later on my iPhone to read whenever I have the time. It also brings me to my next point. There also are two Bookmark lists for reading very shortly and reading some time, but let's see where they end up at in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E) Remembering:&lt;/strong&gt; I leave that with [Evernote](http://evernote.com/) really. Whatever I have read and liked, whatever I think I would like to save, whatever I want to remember, it ends up in Evernote. Either through a forward in Read it Later, via a Bookmarklet or right from the Mac. And it ends up in Spotlight on the Mac too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F) Friendfeed:&lt;/strong&gt; I am actually not sure what to od with this now. I was actually setting it up as my personal search engine. I ended up adding people I think are emm... intelligent and as they add all their personal feeds to their accounts, I presume in the long term it will/would have allow(ed) me to get very good search results. Sadly now they have been bought by Facebook so I will have to revisit Noserub again but that is against my idea of not having a server. Maybe just locally. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G) What is missing:&lt;/strong&gt; I still need one thing that aggregates it all really. I'd like all that is being shared with notes to end up somewhere, full content, all items in evernote, all my twitter messages, all my blog posts, all my photos, whatever. It is still a little bit too distributed. But as distributed is the way of the future I am looking forward to using this setup now and re-integrating that. I am hoping for a few things for the new Social Timeline being developed by Squarespace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are you using as your rememberall.&lt;/p&gt;
