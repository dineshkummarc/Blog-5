Well, some time ago I posted [a story](http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=bizkiffer&amp;itemid=58876) about some of the albums that I downloaded from eMusic.com. Among other's it included this:

*Various Artists - Bomb Hip Hop - Revenge of the B-Boy
Very cool. &quot;Some people compose songs ... Dr. Rubberfunk de-compose. Now here to write some very nice songs, like this next one.&quot; *
Now that post got a comment, by, or so it seems. Dr. Rubberfunk saying thank you for the kind words. Check out his site at [funkydown.co.uk](http://www.funkydown.co.uk/). The internet is always fun ;)
