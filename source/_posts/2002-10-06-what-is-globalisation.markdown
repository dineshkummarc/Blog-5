A friend of mine received this via e-mail:

*In regards to the &quot;Globalization Protests&quot; going on this weekend in Washington DC.......... 

What is globalization?, one may ask. 

Well, below here is probably the best example on the definition of globalization. 

Question: What is the height of globalization? 
Answer: Princess Diana's death 

Question: How come? 
Answer: An English princess with an Egyptian boyfriend crashes in a French tunnel, driving a German car with a Dutch engine, driven by a Belgian who was high
on Scotch whiskey, followed closely by Italian paparazzi, on Japanese motorcycles, treated by an American doctor, using Brazilian medicines! And this is sent to
you by a Burmese, using Bill Gates' technology which he stole from the Japanese. 

And you are probably reading this on one of the IBM clones that use Taiwanese-made chips, and Korean made monitors, assembled by Bangladeshi workers in a
Singapore plant, transported by lorries driven by Indians, hijacked by Indonesians and finally sold to you by Chinese men! 

That, my friend, is GLOBILIZATION.
