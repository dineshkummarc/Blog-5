Kick F***ing A** and Wow. I just followed the link in the post [Future is here now](http://popone.innocence.com/archives/2005/04/08/future_is_here_now.php) and got to [this](http://paulrademacher.com/housing/). It's a system that uses Google Maps and Craiglist to show you where there are some houses free in a city in the US. I can for example say that I want to buy a house in San Francisco in the $200 to $500k range. It will then show me only those including the pop-over images and everything. Very nice indeed.
