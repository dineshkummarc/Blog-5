I have just had my teeth remoddeled and sadly I didn't take it too well this time. Now my jaw seems to want to relax and is not really opening all the way. The numbness is gone but with it comes a bit of pain. I presume it will be gone soon and all in all I am very happy as this is almost the last time I have seen the dentist for some time now. I was starting to feel at home at that place, which is rather scary. Thanksfully the lunch today will be soup.
