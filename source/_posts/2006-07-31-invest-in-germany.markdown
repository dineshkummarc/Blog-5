[Jamie](http://tramchase.com/) messages me an image recently.

Knowing that he lives in the US, it did look like a weird sight. I then learned that these kind of posters ([here](http://www.invest-in-germany.de/graphics/landofideas/cs8.jpg) is another one) are all over Grand Central in New York. At least he has seen them nowhere else. With Grand Central being a major hub in New York, and New York being a very financial city, this actually does make sense, or at least if it makes sense, then in Grand Central.

So there you go. [Invest in Germany](http://www.invest-in-germany.de/). You might want to invest in [Ormigo](http://ormigo.com/) while you're at it ;)
