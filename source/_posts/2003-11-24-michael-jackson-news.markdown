This is another interesting thing that the web enables. Michael Jackson has set up (or rather made set up ;)) [this site](http://www.mjnews.us/) which he will use for public statements. In a sense, it allows him to keep the spin the media puts on his court case at least a little bit in control. He cannot control what is said, but he can at least make sure that what he says is heard and not twisted arround in any way.

The idea is also good for corporations and other institutions who can publish full interviews of their employees to allow readers of excerpts to read the entire thing before making up their mind on the basis of what the publishing organe chose to print.
