Some time ago, Novitel had sued Dirk Olbertz, who runs blogger.de for a comment by someone on somebodies blog. Far fetched already. Well, they brought it to the courts and Dirk Olbertz was supported by Udo Vetter who runs [lawblog.de](http://www.lawblog.de/) :) You can now read his account [here](http://www.lawblog.de/index.php/archives/2004/10/20/novitel-olbertz/). In short, they lost on most accounts (Novitel that is) and will likely loose on all the others as well. It's in German, so try [Babelfish](http://babelfish.altavista.com/) for a translation. Great stuff, and congratulations to Dirk!

&lt;B&gt;Update&lt;/B&gt;: More info posted by Udo Vetter [here](http://www.lawblog.de/index.php/archives/2004/10/21/novitel-olbertz/). Lots of it. :)
