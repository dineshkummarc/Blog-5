I just figured out that if you subscribe to [my feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/owt) you are at an advantage than with reading the web site. :) I just updated [the Jamba post](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/12/the_great_jamba.html) which you will have noticed in the feed but not in your browser. Well now you did as I wrote about it, but ... you get the idea. Did I say that I am excited? For several reasons.
