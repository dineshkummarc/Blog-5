Oh damn. I was feeling all good about getting the new iPhone until a short while ago. A bit of background is needed.

I have a contract at another carrier, called Base, and cancelled my contract there, which ends 17th of October 2008 now. I do want to port over my number from Base to T-Mobile though. There is a rule that the number portability can be requested 4 months before the end of the contract, 18th of July in my case. I thought i would be getting a temporary number at T-Mobile then, but as I have just learnt, this is not the case. I can order now, and they can request the number porting on the 18th, but I will only get t he iPhone and the new contract in October. I am not sure why I should order now then ;)

There is a time limited pricing option for the iPhone introduction which might make me order the iPhone sooner but I am feeling a bit weird as I am sure that in 3 months a lot can happen and there might be some price changes again and other new options. I even called Base to see if they would not free up my number sooner, but that does not seem to work, which is another bad thing. The only thing I could do now is use my old number and get an iphone with that one, using the Base number through a Pre-Paid card, but that sounds like a really nutty idea.

Life is hard some times. No iPhone for me for another 3 months it seems. Good that my Parents gave me a gift-certificate for part of the price of the iPhone for my birthday a few weeks back. It will always be christmas until I check that now ;)
