The [Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org/) is a wonderful thing in general, and allows you to look at how different web sites looked some time ago. Check out [the timeline on oliver.thylmann.com](http://web.archive.org/web/*/oliver.thylmann.com) for example. Thanks to [Heiko's post](http://www.hebig.com/archives/001940.shtml) I now found &lt;a title=&quot;Recall&quot; href=&quot;http://recall.archive.org/&quot;&gt;Recall, which makes the entire archive searchable. You can for example search for [Voldemort between 1999 and 2000](http://recall.archive.org/search?query=Voldemort&amp;afterMonth=%A0&amp;afterYear=1999&amp;beforeMonth=Today&amp;beforeYear=2000). Great stuff.
