Blogging helps me find the most interesting things out there. This is how the world will change, but I think I am repeating myself. Anyway. Today I read the [introduction of 5 new members](http://prplanet.typepad.com/ceobloggers/2004/09/introducing_5_n_1.html) of the CEO Bloggers Club, among others, about Oliver Wagner, who founded [Augenmerk](http://www.augenmerk.de/) ([english site](http://www.augenmerk.com/)). Through this I again, found [Medpreis.de](http://www.medpreis.de/), something I already visited once, agreed, but I came across it again and put it on my furl list. Oliver (not me, Oliver Wagner ;)), also blogs at [agenturblog.de](http://www.agenturblog.de/) and I am looking forward to getting an insight into his thinking, read: I subscribed to his feed.

I also found out about [the Big Blog Company](http://bigblogcompany.net/) as Jackie Danicki, one of their Associates, also is on the list of new people in the CEO Bloggers Club. They're focussing on getting corporations to blog or at least use blogs. I think I faintly remember that I already visited their site once, but it looks to be taking up steam now. 

Learned a lot through linkages today. :)
