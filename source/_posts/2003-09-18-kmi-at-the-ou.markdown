I am studying for an MBA at the [OUBS](http://oubs.open.ac.uk/), part of the [Open University](http://www.open.ac.uk/) and I just found out that they have a [Knowledge Media Institute](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/) with some interesting projects. Sadly [WebOnto](http://webonto.open.ac.uk/ ) does not seem to work at the moment, but [Meet-O-Matic](http://www.meetomatic.com/about.asp) looks interesting too. Or check out [BuddySpace](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/projects/buddyspace/) or [Apollo](http://apollo.open.ac.uk/).
