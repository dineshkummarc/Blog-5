Ok, this is cool: &lt;a title=&quot;Apple - iPod Photo&quot; href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ipodphoto/&quot;&gt;Apple - iPod Photo. An iPod that sync with iPhoto too and has a seemingly wonderful color screen. If you add a CF or MMC card reader you can just kind of back up your photos on your holiday. Oh boy. What do I do with my iPod now? ;)
