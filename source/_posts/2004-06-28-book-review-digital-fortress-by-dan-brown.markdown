Ok, I think I have enough of Dan Brown now. This is the third book I read from him and it has been going downhill. Ok, I started with the newest and most acclaimed one, which explains this a little bit but still, it's sad. This one is a good book, really nice to read, and I couldn't put it down, but it is a little bit hard to believe from time to time. He wrote it in 1998 and I think he wasn't all there yet back then. There is a lot of stuff in there about the NSA and there are some interesting twists in the plot, but it's just not believable in some situations. Not a must read, but a good one at that.
