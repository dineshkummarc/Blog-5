Something that started as an internal development here at [Ormigo](https://ormigo.com/) is now out. It's called [PHPIDS](http://php-ids.org/) and I have [written about it before](http://blog.thylmann.net/2007/05/04/php-based-intrusion-detection-system/). Congratulations to the community that has built around it and especially to [.mario](http://mario.heideri.ch/), who started the project here after a few days off-site brainstorming about our future.

Good to see the system get some traction and being used by some other web sites. Looking forward to see it develop.

A second internal project, this time the driving force is [Timo](http://teemow.com/), is [Jamal](http://jamal.moagil.de/). This has really helped us from the start to keep ourselves sane and to not mix html, javascript and css. Timo just recently added a mailing list to the system. I'll just borrow from the web site to explain shortly what it is:

&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;searchword0&quot;&gt;Jamal&lt;/span&gt; is a set of conventions and small javascript libraries to archieve a complete separation of  html, css and javascript in your web application. &lt;span class=&quot;searchword0&quot;&gt;Jamal&lt;/span&gt; is built on [ class=&quot;ext-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;jQuery&lt;/span&gt;](http://jquery.com/)  and inspired by MVC frameworks like [ class=&quot;ext-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/span&gt;](http://rubyonrails.com/), [ class=&quot;ext-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;CakePHP&lt;/span&gt;](http://cakephp.org/) and its derivatives. &lt;/em&gt;

I am really happy to see such tools spring from internal developers, giving back to the community that allows us to do what we do.

Update: I wrote PHPIDS Version 1 previously, but you should never underestimate the versioning by developers and hence, Jamal wins with 0.3, against PHPIDS 0.2 ;)
