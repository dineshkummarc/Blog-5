Thanks got to &lt;a title=&quot;Russell Beattie's post&quot; href=&quot;http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1005813.html&quot;&gt;Russell Beattie's post about [an article](http://mobenta.com/news/shownews-1388.html) that talks about a mobile version of WGamer.com on the Sprint Network. Since launch in June 2003 they had 1.25 million readers and 650,000 game purchase referrals through the publication! As Russel rightly calculates, that is something like 100k apps bought via people reading a mobile magazine! Now that's how big mobile gaming can be at this time, and it's only starting, really starting. We haven't even gone into a high growth phase yet.
