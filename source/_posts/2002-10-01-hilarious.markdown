Got this from thijs:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0595094724/ref%3Dcm%5Fcustrec%5Fgl%5Facc/002-4427637-0916022

I think the book is real but the customer reviews are too much fun. And you might want to check out the other books that these people buy :)

The Gallery of Regrettable Food by James Lileks 
Walter, the Farting Dog by William Kotzwinkle, et al

&lt;B&gt;Update&lt;/B&gt;: There is an entire collection of these things:
The Zen of Farting: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0898048362/ref=pd_sim_books/002-4427637-0916022?v=glance
