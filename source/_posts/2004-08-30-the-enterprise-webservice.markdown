A few days ago, Thijs post about why [he hates &quot;Enterprise Software&quot;](http://blog.taospace.com/2004/08/why_i_hate_ente.html) and has some very good points. These things are getting awfully complex because they want to be everything for everyone. In this light, reading Jonathan Schwartz's post on the question [&lt;i&gt;&quot;Who chose your Search Engine?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/20040825#who_picked_your_search_engine1) is an interesting one. Jonathan argues that while CIOs have built themselves an empire, deciding which software goes where (and in the process needing to have a 3CD Oracle install to support everyone, see Thijs' post), this is coming to an end. You are starting to choose which kind of software you use for what. At least this is true for the search engine you use. It is also true for the mobile phone you use at work, for many at least. You might also want to have an IM client on your desktop that has your friends in it. Companies like Semco even allow you to buy your own hardware and decide what you need, not even having somebody in charge of the IT systems. 

Mixing an matching all of this, I am wondering if through the power of WebServices you might be building upon existing web sites and translate them into the enterprise. Just do all your purchasing through eBay, limiting buys to &quot;Buy Now&quot; and high ratings for the seller. Store your images for design purposes on Flickr.com. Do you booking via an open API of some booking agency. In this scenario, those who haven open and documented APIs will win in the long run because once connected, you are unlikely to change. It will also do away with making most stuff internally. Maybe the ASP model will get a revival. Not sure yet. But I am thinking.

&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: As often Thijs has explained all of this a lot better than I did or could. [Check it out](http://blog.taospace.com/2004/08/the_rebellion_w.html)! Thanks Thijs!
