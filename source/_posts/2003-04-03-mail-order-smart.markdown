The biggest (I think) mail order company in Germany [Quelle](http://www.quelle.de/), is selling several [Smart](http://www.smart.de/) cars. Yes, cars. You order them, and DHL (owned by Deutsche Post) will ship it to you ;). The german new story is &lt;a title=&quot;News &amp; Wetter | Wirtschaft | MSN | FOCUS Online | FOCUS Online | News&quot; href=&quot;http://news.focus.msn.de/G/GN/gn.htm?snr=118618&amp;streamsnr=8&quot;&gt;here. DaimlerChrysler, who build the Smart, are supporting it (no shit! ;)). I have to say though that I rather think that this is some brilliant form of guerillia marketing instead of simple sales. That doesn't make it any less brilliant of course ;)
