Now how cool is that. It looks like [OnVista AG](http://www.onvista-ag.de/), the place I work at, is actually on spot 47 of the [Deloitte &amp; Touche European Technology Fast 500](http://www.fast500europe.com/). To be clear, OnVista is on place 47 of the 2002 ranking and I just found out now. Yeah, I am a bit behind in these things it seems ;) But Deloitte &amp; Touche seems to be working on the new listing at this time and I will have to keep looking there.
