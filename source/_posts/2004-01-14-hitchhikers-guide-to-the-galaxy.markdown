Arthur Dent has been found! He will be played by Martin Freeman in the soon-to-start-filming Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ([imdb link](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/)) film, as [BBC is reporting](http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2004/01/12/high_noon_jan_12_2004_news_article.shtml). The fun thing is that we talked about the potential of this film just two days ago and now it [pops up on Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/articles/04/01/13/1429258.shtml?tid=188&amp;tid=97). It will be interesting to see what [Garth Jennings](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm1134029/), who will be directing and wrote the screenplay, will be making of this.
