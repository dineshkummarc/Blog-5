&lt;span class=&quot;flickr-caption&quot;&gt;[Error messages on StudiVZ.de](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bumi/285541845/), originally uploaded by [Bumi](http://www.flickr.com/people/bumi/).&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;flickr-yourcomment&quot;&gt;Bumi posted the following picture of an error message on StudiVZ. We all knew it was a copy of facebook, and it is already clear that it has copied the Stylesheets.

This is getting even better now in that they weren't even imaginative enough to make their own folder names. This is what brought StudiVZ the [Online Star](http://www.gruenderszene.de/?p=71).

Come on germany, we can be more innovative than that! This can't be it. Sure, they got a lot of money in their VC round, but it makes me sad that the biggest things out there are copies. OpenBC is special, Sevenload might be a copy (getting more differentiated day by day) but it's technology is top notch, and there are other german start-ups that are innovative.

I would really like to see more of that happen because I think we have it in us in Germany. We have it in us in Europe. I might add a bit more on what I think we need to make that happen later.
