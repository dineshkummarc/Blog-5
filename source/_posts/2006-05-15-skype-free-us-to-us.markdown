Techcrunch is [reporting](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/05/15/skypeout-now-free-in-us-and-canada/) that Skype is announcing that calls from Skype to a landline or mobile phone in the U.S. or Canada are now free, through the end of the year. The little limit is that you have to be in the US at the time of the call. Emmm... whatever happened to VoIP being internet based and hence location less. I mean if I use skype it travels over IP lines until it hits the final switch where it goes onto the phone lines. If somebody could explain the reasoning (ex not hurting telcos) to this, then please do.
