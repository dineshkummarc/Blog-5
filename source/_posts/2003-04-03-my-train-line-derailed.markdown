Each morning and evening I take the local train (metro, or whatever you want to call it) line number 7 here in Cologne. Now I read that one of them &lt;a title=&quot;KÃ¶lnische Rundschau&quot; href=&quot;http://www.rundschau-online.de/kr/page.jsp?ksArtikel.id=1047658967707&quot;&gt;was almost derailed on tuesday (not the one I was on). Damn! Somebody threw something metal on the tracks and this seems to be happening a lot. On line 7! Not that I am afraid, but hey, ... this is not nice!!! Let me repeat that, this is not nice! ;)
