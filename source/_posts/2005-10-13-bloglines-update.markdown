Bloglines just had an [update](http://www.bloglines.com/about/news#90) and I really like it. First of all they do have keyboard shortcuts now that are actually very nice. You can jump to the next article (j) and get the feeds from the next folder (f) for example. This will seriously speed me up. And one thing I do love is the option to keep articles as new in the mobile version. I tend to read stuff on your mobile and then want to come back on my laptop. Now I don't need to clip them. Very cool! Thanks people of Bloglines :)
