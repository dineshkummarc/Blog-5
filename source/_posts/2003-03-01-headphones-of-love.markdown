I just caught this on Joi Ito's blog. &lt;a title=&quot;Joi Ito's Web: Shure E5c - I'm in sound heaven&quot; href=&quot;http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/01/shure_e5c_im_in_sound_heaven.html&quot;&gt;Shure E5c - I'm in sound heaven. After looking at their [web site](http://www.shure.com/earphones/eseries_e5c.asp) I have to admit that it sounds very reasonable. Having played the drums I know how wonderful it can be for the sound to cancel out all sound coming not from the music you hear via the headphones. Shure knows what they are doing in this field. The only thing is, they cost $499!!! A little steep for headphones for me at the moment. But I am very happy to know that the little brother costs $100 and that music technology is going in the right direction. And mind you, this means you can turn up the music less, not more. It's not needed anymore as you don't need to cancel out the sound coming from outside with more volume on the headset.
