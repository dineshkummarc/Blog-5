Interesting article on BMEZINE entitled [Pierced Eyeglasses](http://www.bmezine.com/news/pubring/20041214.html). It tells the story of two guys building a pair of glasses that simple attach to a bridge piercing. Very interesting indeed for those of us that don't like contacts and need glasses. Of course, I don't really want to get pierced, but this is interesting :)
