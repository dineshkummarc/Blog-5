Kevin Werbach's [post on VoIP](http://werbach.com/blog/2004/05/05.html#a1477) is making the rounds, or rather his quote of Michael Powell, chairman of the FCC, said about VoIP at a cable industry trade show:

&lt;I&gt;&quot;If you're a big incumbent and you've sort of enjoyed a competitive advantage . . . you, in my opinion, ought to be terrified.&quot; 
[...]
&quot;I think it's going to be the very, very best and biggest breakthrough in our ambitions and dreams about competition ever.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;

Let me, for emphasis sake, repeat the first sentence which is just plain wonderful:

&lt;I&gt;&quot;If you're a big incumbent and you've sort of enjoyed a competitive advantage . . . you, in my opinion, ought to be terrified.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;

Kevin adds a few points to this [his post](http://werbach.com/blog/2004/05/05.html#a1477). All in all, this is a very powerful point and something why I might even remotely think about investing in the german company [Freenet.de](http://www.freenet.de/). They are moving into VoIP in a big way and in a good way and with SIP phones comes out and SkyPe getting some attention, all this stuff could really take off. Could. Would. Maybe. But still. Did I already mention that there is a SkyPE client for the PocketPC? I think there is even one for my Nokia 6600. If I had a GPRS flatrate I might even be able to do some free calling. ;)
