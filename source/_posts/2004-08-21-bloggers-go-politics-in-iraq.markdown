Very cool article on &quot;This is Rumor Control&quot; about two bloggers in Iraq that have decided to go into politics. They feel that their ability to talk to Iraqis through their blogs have allowed them to get more of a feel with the feeling of people out there and to be able to push ideas through their blogs. Now they feel the need to extend that into real politics. Very cool!
