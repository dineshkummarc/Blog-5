Hi Everyone,

I am back under the living with the bed full of candy. We just had Karneval in Aachen, which is somewhat similar to Karneval in Rio just a bit more foolish and less naked. The parade started at 1300 which was when we started drinking beer, screaming, shouting, having loads of fun. OCHER ALAAF is what you are shouting here in Aachen by the way. Ocher would be people from Aachen in the local dialect. Alaaf is just ... emm... what you scream on Karneval. :)

The city was full full full with hundreds of people in front of our appartment on the main market (did I already tell you I live on the main square of Aachen?). The parade took about 3 hours. There is still a lot of screaming and musik outside of my window and it will probably continue throughout the night. I presonally slept for 2 hours after 2 liters of beer which is something that my body is not used to between 13:00 and 17:00 :) I would probably be at 4 liters now if we had not decided to stop the party for a bit and possible pick up at night again. I probably shouldn't have allowed my body to relax :)

As another note I am working on my own style for my journal which is really an interesting thing to do. And I like some of the basics from which I started so much that I will probably use it for my own pages which I am just starting.
