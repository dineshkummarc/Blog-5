&quot;*Instead of gigging round toilets for ten years trying to get a record deal, gig around toilets for ten years and ask people for their email addresses. If what youâ€™re doing strikes a chord, youâ€™ll be financially better off while remaining pure and free to do what you want.*&quot; - Steven Hogarth, Marillion

That's from &lt;a title=&quot;appetite for resurrection | The Register&quot; href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/04/28/marillion_comeback/&quot;&gt;Marillion: appetite for resurrection | The Register, an article giving a little bit of background to the recent success of Marillion, which they achieved all on their own, without a record company, meaning that they also get the money... all on their own. No money for the record company here. Thank you. Go on please. 

I caught this via Thijs post [Inevitable...](http://blog.taospace.com/2004/04/inevitable.html), where he also links to a [Courtney Love speech from the Digital Hollywood online entertainment conference in 2000](http://www.cdbaby.net/articles/courtney_love.html), which blew my mind back then and does so again this time. A must read to grasp the music industry. 

And yes, I agree with Thijs that whoever can get a good business going to help musicians will be hated by the music industry and be really successful. Lots of stuff to still happen there.
