I am getting somewhere with my WML home page. WML being the way WAP pages are developed just like HTML. It can be a pain sometimes though as it is very strict with the tags.

Anyway. I now have moved the general features of my [links list](http://oliver.thylmann.com/links/links.php) over to WML. I still need to make some layout stuff to make it look a bit better and remove some things and so on. And via the main page you can look up one of my quotes at random or find my e-mail or call me. The call me is especially fun as it just brakes down the WAP connection and starts a call on the mobile phone. I am trying to do the &quot;Add me to your Addressbook&quot; part but that somehow does not work yet ;)

Still lots to do and learn, but it's fun.
