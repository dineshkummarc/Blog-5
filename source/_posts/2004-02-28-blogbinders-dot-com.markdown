I just registered with [BlogBinders.com](http://www.blogbinders.com/) thanks to a [pointer by Jeremy](http://www.ensight.org/archives/2004/02/27/blogbinderscom.html). It allows you, theoretically, to make your blog into a book. The bad thing is that it isn't available for TypePad if I see it right. I sent in the request because this would be a really nice thing to do with the [OUBS Blog](http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/) once my studies are finished. Not for publishing but just to have.
