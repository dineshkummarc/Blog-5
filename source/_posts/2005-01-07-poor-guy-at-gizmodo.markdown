You just mind your own business, go a little bit to CES, report a bit on Gizmodo and what happens? You start your way to the airport, get a call and a few minutes later you are sitting down with Bill Gates to have a chat. :)

The start of the interview is right here: &lt;a title=&quot;G-Money and Me: Bill Gates Interview&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/gmoney-and-me-bill-gates-interview-029198.php&quot;&gt;Gizmodo : G-Money and Me: Bill Gates Interview.

The picture is just wonderful :)
