My brother has picked up an article on CNN.com about the idea that machines will be able to think, and be afraid and things, by 2050. In his comment he rightfully [poses a question](http://ft.typepad.com/adultweb/2005/05/cnncom_brain_do.html): &lt;I&gt;Airplanes that are afraid of crashing?!?! Remind me to stop flying by 2050, I do not want to crash because some bird flies into an engine, the plane gets scared of crashing, panics and then actually DOES crash because it paniced! Awesome idea.&lt;/I&gt;

I can hear the plane now: &quot;ATTENTION ATTENTION, A BIRD ATTACKED ME!!! THERE IS A 50.000001% likelyhood of it having an effect on the engine!!! I AM EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED AT THE MOMENT BUT WILL TRY TO GRAB ALL MY MARBLES AND MIGHT NOT SHUT MYSELF DOWN BECAUSE I AM TOO AFRAID IF YOU ALL THINK HAPPY THOUGHTS!!!&quot; (end screaming airplane) :)
