You get up in the morning and suddenly there is the [Yahoo! Search blog](http://www.ysearchblog.com) with an [introduction article](http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000012.html) by Jeff Weiner, their SVP of Search &amp; Marketplace. It really does look nice and I am looking forward to see if it has a good start. You can find out a lot more about the blog from [Jeremy Zawodny's Introduction](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/002431.html). Great info in there for those thinking about convincing their company to go blogging.
