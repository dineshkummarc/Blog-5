Ok, this is starting to get on my nerves. [Venturebeat is reporting](http://venturebeat.com/2009/03/16/facebook-to-users-how-open-can-you-go/) that you can now choose to have parts of your items within Facebook public, aka visible for everybody. Facebook themselves go into [a bit more detail](http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=60186587130):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just go to [your privacy page](http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?ref=mb) and change the settings you want to the new &quot;Everyone&quot; option. You can opt to make one or all of the following profile elements more open: Profile, Status Updates, Links, Wall Posts, Basic Info, Personal Info, Education Info, Work Info, Photos of You and Videos of You.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yehaa! Another public profile. Another bit of status updates. Another place to copy more of the same. Can all you people really start deciding what it is going to be? [Xing](http://xing.com) is for my professional life really, and I am very happy that they are sticking with that focus. [Facebook](http://facebook.com) was for my general social graph / friend connections that is beyond just business. I really like it to be more private because it can be, as it has my friend connections. I am putting a lot of stuff into Facebook, which I am also putting into [thylmann.net](http://thylmann.net/othylmann) by the way, so it is very similar to [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com) there for me (Oooops, another one there. ;)). I am slowly not able to keep track anymore people!!! It would be no problem if they were all copy cats to start out with but they were freaking different!!! Grrrrr....! 

At least they should all give me the option to keep everything out of the SE indizes even if it is public. And this again pushes the importance of something that is portable and really mine, e.g. my own Noserub install at thylmann.net. Because you know what? My ID, My Everything, My Life is freaking MINE. And that means that I need to be in full control and need to be able to decide what people are pointed to and move it, with all the content.

So I want a few things:

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Give me the option to lock out Search Engines&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Give me a full data export of my data in XML&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Somebody build the perfect [life aggregator](http://blog.thylmann.net/2008/12/28/self-generated-content-infrastructure/)... I think Noserub is a good start&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Because you know what? These things are slowly not anymore about connecting me with my friend but to keep a log of my life, and that is something completely different and something that needs to be extremely more portable.
