[Jamie Oliver](http://www.jamieoliver.com/) is opening up a new restaurant in Amsterdam as part of his &quot;Fifteen&quot; chain, if you can call it a chain already. There is another one in London that I know off. If I remember the system correctly, then it is more or less a place for people to learn how to cook and it's more or less run by a group of fifteen (now you know where the name comes from ;)) students who were more or less collected off the street (homeless or at least jobless). 

Jamie has a few pictures from the graduation night of the last group of 15 from London and a quest for a general manager for the new place in Amsterdam, just if somebody is looking for a new interesting and challenging job: [Check it out.](http://www.jamieoliver.com/diary/2004/08/02/graduation_night.php)
