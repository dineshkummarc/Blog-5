In my mind it gets proven again and again. Yes, the ultimate goal is making money, but that is as they say, just a necessary ingredient but not the reason for being. The reason for being, especially for employees working hard, needs to be something else and that needs to be lived top down and bottom up and sideways. It needs to be real. This is what I felt again when reading [this article on JetBlue on FastCompany](http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/82/jetblue.html) which talks about their growing pains, or rather, their potential growing pains. It's a great artilce about a great company and some amazing people. Just check what David Neeleman has learned:
- Do more for customers
- Only the paranoid survive
- Actions speak louder than words
- The best culture polices itself
- Competition is teh ultimate motivation
- Employees have to understand the business

Very nice list I have to say. What are your values inside your company? Do they fit with your own?
