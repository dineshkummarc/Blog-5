Well, I just returned from the lung specialist. Seems like I really had an astma attack. She is just not sure yet where it came from as I have a rather bad infection which could be a cause, or part of a cause. Now we need to get that out of the way which results in me being a walking pharmacy at the moment. 

I am forbidden to go outside. No walks of any kind. Rest, total rest. When measuring my lungs the following appeared. Based on liters of air both breathing in and out, a normal thing is 70% of some standard amount. For my age 80-90% would actually be what would be expected. I am at the moment at 35% which seems to be very bad. This explains why walking up the 4 floors to our new place takes ages. Any 90 year old could overtake me. :)

So now I need to rest and get this infection out which will most likely remove most of my breathing problems. Then a new line of tests comes next monday. I am actually feeling good I have to say, as long as I don't run around I am just fine.
