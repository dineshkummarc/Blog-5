&lt;p&gt;I already had lots of talks about this with friends and now MSNBC wrote about it: [Television Reloaded](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7935915/site/newsweek/page). The article is a must read to get an overview and it's nice to see the big guns talk about it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ethos of New TV can be captured in a single sweeping mantra: &lt;em&gt;anything you want to see, any time, on any device.&lt;/em&gt; &quot;We are at a watershed moment in home entertainment,&quot; says Brian Roberts, CEO of the cable giant Comcast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let that sink in. Anything you want to see, any time, on any device. The line between internet and tv will become blurry. I'll tune in to CNN.com/sports/ on my TV or on the web site, with text and video interacting. I can automatically search over the meta data of the TV show to find the segment I want to watch, syncing the news from the previous night to my laptop for the commute to work based on meta data searches. Prime time will only be prime time if there is something that happens live in the real world behind it, like a football game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now that you've stored your show on a TiVo, it's only logical to take
it with you on your laptop, hand-held viewer or PSP game player.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually one reason I might really look into the PSP :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Already there is more data downloaded for video over the Internet than
there is for music,&quot; says Mike Ramsay, cofounder of TiVo. &quot;What happens
when a 14-year-old creates a BitTorrent browser that's easy to use and
plugs right into your TV? You go from 500 channels to 50 million
channels.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem then becomes what to watch. Word of mouth will be key, as you will likely want to watch something that others watch to, just to be able to talk about it. Interesting things ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
