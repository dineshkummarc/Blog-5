My brother bought a Playstation 2. And I thought about buying one before that. And now I tried it and it is cool. And now I am closer to buying one than ever before. Prices dropped 25% on Friday (yesterday) too! Damn Damn Damn! And I would be able to watch DVDs... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Live Sucks! :)
