This is about two groups purposefully linking up to achieve something.

This involves negotiation of boundaries and can be strategic alliances or intra-organisation learning.

Failure often comes from tension and conflict. But boundaries are about difference and hence some of them have to be overcome like different ways of working or concepts of effectiveness.

Resource-dependency theory is one way of thinking about this as you gain power over the dependence on key resources. They need what others offer. It assumes that actions are taken only when they clearly benefit the interests of the group and that impasse results when interests of two groups are not exactly aligned.

Collaborative advantage is a simple rational exchange between parties, about creating joint value. 1+1 &gt; 2. This can only be achieved by building trusting, open and high-commitment relationships.

There are several stages of collaboration:
-	Seeking agreement
-	Selecting mode
o	Legal form
o	Number of participants
o	Duration
o	Range of joint assets
o	Range of activities
o	Intensity of co-operation
o	Distribution of rights
-	indentifying and attracting partners
-	Evaluation collaborative capability
-	Starting work
o	Structure
o	Action
o	Goals
o	Accountabilities
-	Evaluation collaborative ventures

You should look out at the interdependence of groups as this needs to be equal and noone should only depend on the other. (low, sequential or reciprocal)

There is also a culture in working in a group and you need to foster than and manage it. Policies and culture are important.
