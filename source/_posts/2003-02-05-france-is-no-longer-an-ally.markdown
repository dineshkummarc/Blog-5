Read this: &lt;a title=&quot;France 'no longer ally' -- The Washington Times&quot; href=&quot;http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20030204-031831-1626r.htm&quot;&gt;Pentagon adviser: France 'no longer ally' -- The Washington Times&lt;/a&gt;

It's simply amazing. I am truely wondering what they are smoking over there. An ally seems to mean that you have to say what the other says, no matter what you think is right. And most of not all of Germany is against a war in Irak without UN support (many are probably against any war period) and Schr√∂der did not loose because he was going the way he does in the Irak question. He has lost, or rather his party has lost, the election because there is high unemployment and other problems in germany.
