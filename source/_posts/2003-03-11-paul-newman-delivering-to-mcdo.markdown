I just read that (Paul) Newman's Own Inc. is delivering a salad sauce to McDonald (&lt;a title=&quot;Yahoo! Nachrichten - Kino-Nachrichten - Paul Newman beliefert McDonald's mit Salatsaucen&quot; href=&quot;http://de.news.yahoo.com/030311/286/3c44z.html&quot;&gt;Yahoo! Nachrichten - Kino-Nachrichten - Paul Newman beliefert McDonald's mit Salatsaucen) The interesting thing here is rather about Newman's Own. Two slogans/quotes on the front page tell a good story:

- Shameless Exploitation In Pursuit Of The Common Good
- It Started As A Joke And Got Out Of Control. - Paul Newman

What is all this about you might ask. Well. All of the company's profits, over $125 Million by now, are going to charities!!! And the company seems to be growing like crazy. [Check it out!](http://www.newmansown.com/)
