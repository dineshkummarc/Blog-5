A good evening to everybody!

I just created my journal. Actually this is something I thought about creating for some time and now I read some of other people I know and it just is so damn interesting to read (and as I will hopefully find out soon to write) that I needed to do this too.

After having recently found out that I am an Activist (as of Honey and Mumford - 1986 theory on learning styles) and I need to do a bit of reflecting to grow further, this might be a good way to start.

Why did I do this now? Well as said above I just read other people's journals and next to that I actually should be doing other things which makes this a good excuse :) 

I will look a bit closer at what I can do here and return tomorrow or something with more. Stay tune for BizKiffer has just begun (more on that nick later :))
