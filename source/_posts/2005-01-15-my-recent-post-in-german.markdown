I recently [posted in german](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/solarenergie_da.html), which I just though I'd point out that it's a look at how fast some search engines will index the post and actually I am looking at who will be ranked higher between me and a co-worker. So no, I am not suddenly writing too much german and especially not too much weird stuff. :) We'll see how it goes.
