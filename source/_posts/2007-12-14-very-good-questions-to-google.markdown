John Battelle [posted a great list of questions](http://battellemedia.com/archives/004150.php) posed to Google by Rep. Joe Barton in relation to the Google DoubleClick buy. By now, people are [speculating](http://www.alleyinsider.com/2007/12/googleclick-inquiry-microsoft-lobbyists-get-to-rep-barton.html) if Microsoft didn't help with these questions, especially because they are really questions all of us would like an answer to. Here are just some of the questions:

&lt;em&gt;4.	Please explain how Google uses the information or data described in Question 1(a) - (1), or any additional data, to drive or target advertisements to individual users' computers.   &lt;/em&gt;

Those 1(a) to (1) include stuff like your web history, picasa usage, desktop search, ... :)

&lt;em&gt;5.	In particular, please explain whether Google Maps directs advertisements to IP addresses based on that user's Google Maps search query history.  &lt;/em&gt;

So if you search for San Francisco, do they presume your IP is from there?

&lt;em&gt;10.	Please explain whether Google posts a link to its privacy policy on the home page or search results page of www.google.com and, if not, explain why not.  &lt;/em&gt;

In short: why not? :)

&lt;em&gt;11.	In Google's privacy policy, &quot;personal information&quot; is defined as &quot;information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information by Google.&quot; 	 &lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;  a.	Please describe how Google interprets &quot;reasonably linked.&quot;
b.	Please explain in what circumstances Google links information
such that an individual can be identified.
c.	Please explain whether Google considers an IP address to be &quot;personal information.&quot;
d.	Please explain whether technology exists to personally identify or determine the personal characteristics, including, but not limited to, name, email address, physical address or location, age, gender, or ethnicity of an Internet user based on that user's IP address.
e.	Please explain whether Google is capable of identifying or determining personal characteristics, including, but not limited to, name, email address, physical address or location, age, gender, or ethnicity of an Internet user based on that user's IP address. 		 &lt;/em&gt;

Hard questions these are, especially because Google will probably not want to give that answer :)

&lt;em&gt;a.	If Google does not intend to merge or combine the data Google retains with the information or data retained or collected by DoubleClick, please describe the efficiencies of the Google-DoubleClick merger. 		 b.	If Google does not intend to merge or combine the data Google retains with the information or data retained or collected by DoubleClick, please explain how the information will be segregated. 		 &lt;/em&gt;

ohoh :)

&lt;em&gt;24.	The House passed the Securely Protect Yourself Against Cyber Trespass (SPY ACT) in the current and prior two Congresses.  The SPY ACT, H.R. 964, sponsored by Representatives Mary Bono and Adolphus Towns, mandates an opt-in privacy regime by prohibiting the collection of personal information from a computer without a user's notice and consent prior to the execution of any information collection program. H.R. 964 also demands that a user be able to easily remove or disable the information collection program.  Please explain whether Google's applications are subject to H.R. 964's consent requirements.  If the answer is no, please explain why these programs, which collect personal information, are not subject to the consent regime established by H.R. 964. &lt;/em&gt;

boy oh boy :)
