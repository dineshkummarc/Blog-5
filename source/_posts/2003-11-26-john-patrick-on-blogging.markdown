[John Patrick](http://www.patrickweb.com/), ex VP of Internet Technology at IBM (he was sometimes labled Chief Dreamer ;)) is talking about blogging in business in [this eWeek article](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1396680,00.asp) ([thanks to Ross Mayfield for the link](http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2003/11/john_patrick_on.html)). 

I have to say so that I currently see a Wiki as more capable of knowledge management than a blog, but it is obviously a lot harder to maintain, which pushes the blog in the center of the thinking again. Ross Mayfield's [Social Text](http://www.socialtext.com/) might be a solution there but I'd have to see it to believe it.
