Well if that isn't cool. Slashdot has a story that &lt;a title=&quot;Slashdot | Paris, The City Of Wi-Fi?&quot; href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/articles/03/05/05/1720212.shtml?tid=137&amp;tid=193&quot;&gt;Paris might become &quot;The City Of Wi-Fi&quot;. The idea is to put 2-3 basestations at every metro exit and link them via a fibre network available in the metro tunnels. Now how cool is that ey?
