&lt;a title=&quot;Disinfopedia Main Page - Disinfopedia&quot; href=&quot;http://www.disinfopedia.org/wiki.phtml&quot;&gt;Disinfopedia&lt;/a&gt; is currently down a lot. They just can't handle the traffic they get at this time. The site has been built up to counter propaganda from any source. It seems to be built on Wiki, a tool to have a community build a web page, kind of.
