Reuters has the news: [eBay buys Skype](http://yahoo.reuters.com/financeQuoteCompanyNewsArticle.jhtml?duid=mtfh49665_2005-09-12_07-35-59_n12451799_newsml). That means I now have an investment in Skype. Yeehaaa :) The total value of the deal is $4.1 billion while a part of this is paid only in 2008/9 dependent on reaching some revenue targets. [Paud Kedrosky seems to be one of the first to find it](http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/001732.html) and I just [got it via Ben Barren](http://benbarren.blogspot.com/2005/09/ebay-skype-marriage-rumours-true.html). He says this comes in at 40 times revenue for this year. A Conference Call is going on soon and more information is [here](http://investor.ebay.com/event.cfm).

That press release holds in information why this is _VERY_ important: 

*The acquisition also enables eBay and Skype to pursue entirely new lines of business.  For example, in addition to eBayâ€™s current transaction-based fees, ecommerce communications could be monetized on a pay-per-call basis through Skype.  Pay-per-call communications opens up new categories of ecommerce, especially for those sectors that depend on a lead-generation model such as personal and business services, travel, new cars, and real estate.  eBayâ€™s other shopping websites -- Shopping.com, Rent.com, Marktplaats.nl and Kijiji â€“ can also benefit from the integration of Skype. *

'Nuff said.
