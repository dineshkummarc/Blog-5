Great article on business week entitled *&lt;a title=&quot;Championing a Wiki World&quot; href=&quot;http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2004/tc20041019_0375_tc182.htm&quot;&gt;Championing a Wiki World* gives a lot of detail about what this Wiki phenomenon is about and especially how the possibilities of running a virtual company are increasing. Just starting knowledge management at the [OUBS](http://oubs.open.ac.uk/) I really am looking forward of trying some stuff with the co-students in the wiki world. I already have set up a little space inside by JotSpot Wiki with some summary application that I have written for the course. Neat stuff. If you want to read a very nice interview by the way, check [this one with Joe and Graham from JotSpot](http://www.mindwires.com/downloads/jotspot_co-founders_interview.pdf). Very good read. Great company.
