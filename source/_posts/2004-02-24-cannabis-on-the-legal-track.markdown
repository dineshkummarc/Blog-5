Great article at FastCompany called [The Cannabis Conundrum](http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/79/cannabis.html), which talks about new research going on arround the use of Cannabis as a medicine. This has actually been going on for some time already but it seems that we are starting to go into big business, especially with [GW Pharmaceuticals](http://www.gwpharm.com/) having developed a Cannabis spray that allows you to take the drug, or medicine to put it correctly, without needing to smoke it. Looks like Bayer, yep the big german company, will market one of the first drugs in the not to distant future.
