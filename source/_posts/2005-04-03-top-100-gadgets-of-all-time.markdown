&lt;p&gt;Ralf [posts](http://www.design-management.de/archives/2005_03_31.html#000333) about [the top 100 gadgets of all time](http://www.mobilepcmag.com/features/2005_03/top100gadgets.html) and it's a fun list. It includes stuff like the Pez with their poppin' head dispensers, rubik's cube, Tamagotchi, Hohner Harmonica, Zippo, Nokia 5100, the Sextant, the Super Scissors, the Telephone, US Robotics Pilot 1000 (had that one, great stuff!) and the winner, the Apple Powerbook 100 from 1991. Very cool list.&lt;/p&gt;
