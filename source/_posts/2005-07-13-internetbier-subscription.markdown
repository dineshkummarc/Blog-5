Thanks to the &lt;a title=&quot;Internetbier&quot; href=&quot;http://internetbier.de/Artikel.aspx?akg=2&quot;&gt;Internetbier Subscription&lt;/a&gt; you can now get home 18 bottles of 1396, per week, 14 days or monthly, for a total of 10 times for 192 â‚¬s! That's 180 beers for a EUR plus 12 EUR shipment (just to make the calculation easy :)). Interesting model, not that I did get a subscription yet, but interesting enough to talk about.
