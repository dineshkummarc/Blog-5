Lots of people around you are doing wonderful things, and often if you need something, a person right in your neighborhood is doing exactly that thing. Right next to me there is somebody doing some really nice furniture in wood. His site about [MassivholzmÃ¶bel](http://donhuette.de/) (hard woods) is Don HÃ¼tte, and I was positively surprised. Now I need to get Frank to blog about his work, about furniture coming into existence.

Things like this drive me to really conquer the local market with something that finally works in a scalable manner. It's really about thinking local but acting global. It's about using what the internet is about at its core. Allowing for communication, aggregation, networks, markets, platforms, ... . I seriously need to find out what else is there around me, and around my friends.
