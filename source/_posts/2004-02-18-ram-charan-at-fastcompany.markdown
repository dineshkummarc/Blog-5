Thanks to [Jeremy's post](http://www.ensight.org/archives/2004/02/17/my_new_favourite_man.html) about it, I just read [this article](http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/79/ram.html)  on FastCompany about Ram Charan. Ram is a consultant that works more or less arround the clock, doesn't seem to have a life and still is very happy. His ideas seem to be good, but I doubt that many things are really novel, which I will see when I read the book. In this day and age it seems to be of more value to get a point across to get people to act on it rather than develop the point in question. The point exists, it's just ignored, forgotten, unfollowed. His book &lt;i&gt;Profitable Growth Is Everyone's Business : 10 Tools You Can Use Monday Morning&lt;/i&gt; made it on my reading list at least.
