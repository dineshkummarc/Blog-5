Interesting things happening in advertising land. MarketingVOX reports that
*[Yahoo Betas Behavioral Ads, Could Challenge AdSense](http://www.marketingvox.com/archives/2005/06/23/yahoo_betas_behavioral_ads_could_challenge_adsense/index.php?rss1)*. Their using [Revenue Science](http://www.revenuescience.com/default.asp), having hired one of the founders as Chief Data Officer some time ago it seems. I am looking forward to seeing how this turns out.
