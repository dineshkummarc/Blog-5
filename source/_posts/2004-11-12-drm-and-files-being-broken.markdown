Nice post on Gizmodo entitled [ title=&quot;AllOfMP3 Took My Money (And I'm Cool With That)&quot;&gt;AllOfMP3 Took My Money (And I'm Cool With That)](http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/portable-media/allofmp3-took-my-money-and-im-cool-with-that-025548.php). I really liked AllofMP3 too and did spend some money there too. I spent a lot less on iTunes. The end after talking about breaking iTunes DRM system and then getting your files broken when playing them again in iTunes is very nice: *That's fine; I broke their rules, they broke my files. But I'm not buying anything that I want to keep from them anymore, either.* Very fitting, thank you.
