Thijs and me played a bit with his Mac and I am once again positively surprised. For example we put in a CD, started listening, then thought we'd rip it and it started ripping the CD and encoding it and then started (it seems) to play the MP3s in the middle of a file, because there was no click or anything in the music. Very nice.

Also the rest of the interface just seems very nice and consistent. I am now at 99.999% certainty of getting an iBook, up from 99.99% from before playing with his box :)

I also really like Entourage which I could try out because Thijs had the trial version. If syncing works that would rock, plain and simple.

Now I just need to see where I can buy it and at which price. Because it is cheaper at some places but the problem then is that I am not sure how the warranty works when something brakes.
