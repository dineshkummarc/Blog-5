I did it again, this time reintroducing somebody to blogging. Tao actually blogged on LiveJournal several years back but as he [says himself](http://blog.taospace.com/2004/03/on_the_reason_w.html), hasn't been &quot;in on&quot; the entire blogging thing yet, even though it feels like he should be. Being one of the most interesting guys I know, with lots of new ideas in technology, I am happy to see him back in blogging! He always seem to be catching something new going on out there like [Zaplets](http://blog.taospace.com/2004/03/adhoc_workflow.html). So check out &lt;a title=&quot;TaoSpace&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.taospace.com/&quot;&gt;TaoSpace and [feed your aggregator](http://blog.taospace.com/index.rdf). Oh, and [check out his amazingly cool cats](http://taospace.typepad.com/photos/fiat_lux/pict0013.html)
