Well, [Flash Mobs](http://www.wordspy.com/words/flashmob.asp) seems to be just the thing in this day and age.  *In recent weeks, New Yorkers have been using forwarded e-mails to coordinate &quot;flash mobs,&quot; or not-so-random crowds that appear and dissipate within a matter of minutes.* An example would be a group of people meeting at a specific store at 1900 to eat a banana. Or a group of people meeting at one place to ask for Udo for 3 minutes. Then its over again.  Not sure if [Rheingold's Smart Mobs](http://www.smartmobs.com/index.html) were first or if he just observed the system and extended the thinking arround it, which seems much more likely. I might really have to look further into this :)
