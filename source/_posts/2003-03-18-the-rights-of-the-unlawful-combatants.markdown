Frank Boosman posted a New York Times editorial on his blog &lt;a title=&quot;pseudorandom&quot; href=&quot;http://www.boosman.com/blog/2003_03_01_blogarchive.html#90561724&quot;&gt;pseudorandom. To quote the editorial: *It has been 14 months since the first prisoners from the Afghanistan war were taken to a naval base at Guant√°namo Bay in Cuba. The Bush administration says it can hold the detainees indefinitely, without allowing them access to family or legal counsel. Yesterday, a federal Court of Appeals threw out a challenge by some of those detainees to their confinement. The administration and the court are wrong. The detainees may not have the same rights as American citizens, but they are entitled to more due process than they are being given.*

This is very important to think about and remember.
