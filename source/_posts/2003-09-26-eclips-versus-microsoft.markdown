[Here](http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104_2-5081312.html) is a good article on [Eclipse](http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=5599), a new development environment that seems to be taking the world by storm, silently, behind the watchful eye of Microsoft. Maybe the OS is not the threat? Or maybe, as MS has already admited if I remember right, the OS will just not matter much anymore in 5-10 years.
