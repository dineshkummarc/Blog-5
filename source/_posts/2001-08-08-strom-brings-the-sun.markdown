First I have to say that this bed is killing me. Really! It's an old bad and hangs down in the middle, which is ok. But the added bonus is that it is only 2 meters long and solid borders. That means that I have to use the diagonal to really be comfortable. Ah well... I will survive :)

This morning the weather actually was emm... ok. But only for a little bit when the wind started to take up so much that you could not even launch a kite. It was really hard wind and then it started to rain. Hmmm... super. :)

We then decided to finally go to the company that own the appartment (yesterday the weather was too bad) to exchange keys. We only have a spare one now and it stopped raining so we thought it was a good time to go. Off we go to the city to learn that Wednesday their offices are closed ;) At least we got our pizza for today from the supermarket there.

Now the sun has come out and one might call this good weather, the only problem is the wind, which is why there are no people on the beach either. You'd be covered with sand in a minute. We sat in front of the appartment though to read and soak in a bit of sun and this was great. Whatever happens these few days are very relaxing.

But this brough on a good time to take some photos. The are below.



So here are the photos I took.

&lt;img src=&quot;http://oliver.thylmann.com/photos-public/20010808-de_haan/17-bubbles-small.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;bR&gt;This is taken with the camera really close to the ground. I like this as it is a very still and silent image of a very moving situation.

&lt;img src=&quot;http://oliver.thylmann.com/photos-public/20010808-de_haan/20-ocean_sun_overexposed-small.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;bR&gt;I took some photos like this as I liked the sun in the corner. This one is a bit overexposed which makes for a very nice effect I think.

Now on to cooking dinner and finishing off the OU course. This might be the first time I am done with the first book before the tutorial. It will be interesting :)
