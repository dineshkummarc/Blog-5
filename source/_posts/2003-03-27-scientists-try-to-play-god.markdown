Got another joke from the TMF Boards... as they are non-free (but worth paying for none the less ;))...

&lt;I&gt;God is sitting in heaven when a scientist prays to Him.
&quot;God, we don't need you anymore. Science has finally figured out a way to create life out of nothing - in other words, we can now do what you did in the beginning.&quot;

&quot;Oh, is that so? Tell Me...&quot; replies God.
&quot;Well,&quot; says the scientist, &quot;we can take dirt and form it into the likeness of you and breath life into it, thus creating man.&quot;
&quot;Well, that's very interesting...show Me.&quot;
So the scientist bends down to the earth and starts to mold the soil into the shape of a man.
&quot;No, no, NO...&quot; interrupts God, &quot;Get your Own dirt!&quot;&lt;/I&gt;
