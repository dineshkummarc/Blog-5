David Kirkpatrick was one of the moderators at the [DLD06](http://www.dld06.com/) and he has now written [a piece](http://money.cnn.com/2006/02/03/technology/fastforward_fortune/index.htm) for CNNMoney.com about his experience, praising Dr. Hubert Burda and I can only agree. The guy seems very open, charming and focussed on making online a success, independent on what the old models were.
