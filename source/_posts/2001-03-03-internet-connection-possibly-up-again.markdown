Well our flat-rate should be up again on Monday. It seems that with some support groups one hand doesn't know what the other does or can do. Here a little tail.

Our flat-rate did not work. We called T-Online. It was a load problem. Oh ok. No problem.

Just to be save I asked again on who the account is registered. Well go figure. It was still on the wrong person, because I changed it to the company name 3 weeks earlier. We still do not get the right invoice.

Ok. I told them we need to change it again. Well. It now seemed that you cannot change it to a belgium address. Interesting to know as it worked (or did not :)) last time. Ok, I was given another number.

I called there. They said it already was the new address. Hmmm... the others just told me it isn't. Well, another 2 days and it should be pushed through the system. Interesting system.

I called back the technical people 2 days later and well, the new address was no in there. No problem. Can you check the problem again? Yes. Ok. Well it is a load problem. I told them that it cannot be a load problem because it has been going on for 7 days now. Oh ok. Well it can also be that your account is locked. WHAT? And they tell me now? Well, seems like the last person did not know that the error code can have two meanings. Hmmm... 

Called the billing people to find out why the account was locked. Well it was because we did not pay. WE DID NOT GET THE INVOICE!!! Ah well. Now it seemed that they still did not have the right address and they told me you cannot have a belgium address. Interesting once again. I was given the address of the main billing people. They were closed. at 1800!!! Ah well. I called back yesterday. And you wouldn't believe it. They had the right address there now. WOW! And I gave them a bank account after I got the name of the person I spoke to there and they said the account will be active again on Monday. Ok, their system is slow, no problem. Monday is fine. And they promised me that the invoice would be there in 3 weeks. It's a long way from Germany to Belgium :)

That's another nice thing. If you send a snail mail from Brussels to Aachen (1:30 hours by car max) then it is flow to Duesseldorf from Brussels and then driven to Aachen (1:30 hours by car also :)). How efficient :)

But it is still very funny to witness all of this. By the way. If you want to lease a server with Dell, you need to lease it in the country your company is in. Good. No problem. But we need the server at Level 3 in New York. Ah well. We need to ship it then. Shiping a leased $12000 server is fun. Ah well. Let's see what IBM says when they call me back next week :)

Live is so fun. This will be a good weekend. :)
