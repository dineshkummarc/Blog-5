There we go, things are settled, Blu-Ray looses. It [seems](http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/archives/2007/01/12/porn_could_tilt_the_hidef_dvd_war.html) that the porn industry is supporting the HD DVD standard and Sony seems to have just [denied porn on Blu-Ray](http://www.pocket-lint.co.uk/news/news.phtml/6209/7233/porn-blu-ray-dvd-format-war.phtml) DVDs. This was the same thing when Sony denied porn on Betamax and then VHS one. It is surely not the only reason VHS won, but hell, it surely made a difference.

As someone once said, who needs several different angles on the same scene anyway? ;)

Let's see how this plays out.
