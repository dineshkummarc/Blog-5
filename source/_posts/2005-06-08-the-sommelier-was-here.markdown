Well that was nice. We just had a sommelier, actually the founder of [Sommelier Consult](http://www.sommelier-consult.com/) over for two hours, showing us around some wines and is was really nice. Lots of tasting lessons and things about how wine is made and why it tastes like it tastes in different regions. I can only recommend doing something like this.
