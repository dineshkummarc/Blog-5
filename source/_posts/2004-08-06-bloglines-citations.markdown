Check [this post](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/2004/07/jons-radio-feedsterbloglines-citation.html) by Marc Eisenstadt, also at the [KMI](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/) at the OU, a place I am getting more and more interested in. I found this via [this post by Bertrand](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/bertrand/diary/?id=20040726080311). It talks about a mechanism that will allow you to get all the citations of a blog post you are currently reading. Just drag and drop this link: [Bloglines Citations](void(location='http://www.bloglines.com/citations?url='+escape(location.href));) to your bookmarks and you can click it to get all the citations within Bloglines tracking database of the page you are currently reading. Now how cool is that? The only thing I'd need now is to integrate that into the blog directly and then get done with comments alltogether. ;)
