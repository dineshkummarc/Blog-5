In his article [The MBA Menace](http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/83/mbamenace.html), Henry Mintzberg is [at it again](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/05/teaching_leader.html), going on about how bad current fulltime MBA programs really are. 

*The truth is, no one can become a manager in a classroom. Management is not a profession, nor is it science. It is a practice that depends mostly on craft and significantly on art. *

First, I agree. Second, he has a bit of an inside agenda because his newest course isn't full time and largely about sharing experiences. But still, this made me very happy again that my MBA course is part-time, with full work schedule, which links practice and theory very nicely indeed. This is actually why I agree with him. This mix is very good both for learning and for practice. It gives you the best of both worlds and allows you to keep your feets firmly on your ground.
