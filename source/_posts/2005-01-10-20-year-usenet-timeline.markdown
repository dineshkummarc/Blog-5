Google has a nice history view of the past 20 years of Usenet archives via Google Groups, giving it a total of more than 800 million messages starting 1981! Lots of great stuff in there like [Time Berners-Lee's announcement of what become the WWW](http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=6487%40cernvax.cern.ch) or [Linus Torvalds' post about his &quot;pet project&quot;](http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1991Oct5.054106.4647%40klaava.Helsinki.FI) or [Jeff Bezos' hirering](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/mi.jobs/msg/d81b6c1fa8f361fc).

A good list can be found here: &lt;a title=&quot;20 Year Archive on Google Groups&quot; href=&quot;http://www.google.com/googlegroups/archive_announce_20.html&quot;&gt;20 Year Archive on Google Groups&lt;/a&gt;.
