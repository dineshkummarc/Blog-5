&lt;p&gt;Great story by Neil entitled &lt;a title=&quot;Oh for goodness sake&quot; href=&quot;http://www.completetosh.com/weblog/2004/11/oh_for_goodness.html&quot;&gt;Oh for goodness sake&lt;/a&gt;. He ordered a pair of Soundbugs from [Gadgets.co.uk](http://www.gadgets.co.uk/) and sadly they didn't have it in stock. Surely enough the standard delivery charge was in stock. And hence they just billed the items that are in stock... I think you understood by now ;) Check out [his post](http://www.completetosh.com/weblog/2004/11/oh_for_goodness.html) for the mail he received.&lt;/p&gt;
