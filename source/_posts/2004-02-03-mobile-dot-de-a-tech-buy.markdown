Some time ago, eBay has bought [mobile.de](http://www.mobile.de/), the biggest place in Germany to buy cars online. The interesting thing is that eBay said that the revenues through mobile.de will not have a big impact on their revenues. So it was about getting a competitor out of the way? Another idea is coming from Jeremy Zawodny in his post &lt;a title=&quot;eBay to use MySQL?&quot; href=&quot;http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001539.html&quot;&gt;*eBay to use MySQL?*. So this would make mobile.de a tech buy, which is an interesting idea. It would be interesting to see companies that do push MySQL to the limits and what they are doing to get it performing well.

I am currently looking into simply getting MySQL to go very fast for web statistics purposes, which on the other end will result in huge amounts of data that need to be analysed. Thankfully I have the help of people that know a lot more about MySQL than I do :)
