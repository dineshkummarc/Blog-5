Want to know who is a leader in innovation? Check out MIT's Technology Review for their [TR Patent Scorecard 2003](http://www.technologyreview.com/scorecards/index.asp). It will tell you how many patents which company registered, how close they work together with scientiest, how long they exploit their patents, ... several different things that might be of interest for investment decision. It surprised me for example that Nokia's rating in relation to closeness to universities is relatively low.
