Oh boy. Let me summarize [this post on heise](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/95176/from/rss09) for you. Firstof all to put you in the right mind, it seems that the United States Trade Representative Susan Schwag has told CNET News that as long as sites like AllofMP3 exist, the United States will vote against allowing Russia into the WTO. Strong words. :)

As a few more juicy items, the US worked on Russia to close the site, and Russia did, but it does not seem to be so easy. The thing is that AllofMP3 seems to be legal in Russia, and in the absence of real international copyright law, that kidn of makes it legal it seems. AllofMP3 says that they have license contracts with ROMS and are therefore legal. The industry says that they did not authorize ROMS but that only shows that all is not clear.Â VISA has been forced to handle credit care handling for AllofMP3. The CEO of AllofMP3 has been brought to court, but has been set free with no charges.

It will be interesting to see how this little play continues. The world is getting smaller and with it, come some problems.
