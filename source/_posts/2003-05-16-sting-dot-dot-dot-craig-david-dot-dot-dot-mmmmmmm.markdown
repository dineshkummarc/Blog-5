Rise and Fall by [Craig David](http://www.craigdavid.com/) is featuring [Sting](http://www.sting.com/) and boy is this song great! As of Sting's site it is #2 spot in the UK single charts and while I am at it, I really like Sting's idea (or his webmaster's idea ;)) to give a daily MP3, be it live or recorded, for free, for the masses. This is a great way for older artists to introduce potential fans to their music. Now if you could link every MP3 to something like &quot;More like this ...&quot; to a shop, then we would see a lot more free MP3s coming.

On a matter of wine, I am currently enjoying a 1999 bottle of Chateau Haut Bigord, Premieres Cotes de Blaye. It's a very nice and round wine and I have to admit that a work collegue was right. The south afrikan wine we tried at work today (just one taste), was very very shallow against this french one. I swallowed the wine when I started writing this and I still have the taste of the wine moveing and changing in my mouth... wonderful. 

Whoever invented wine... I thank you! Now please play that song again Zinf (my beloved Windows MP3 player)
