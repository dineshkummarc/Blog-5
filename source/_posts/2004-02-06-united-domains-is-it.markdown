[United Domains](http://www.united-domains.de/) is it then. I just registered yesterday to get two domains and I will transfer what I have over to the service. First of all it is dead cheap and you can buy domains from practically everywhere.  You can have .biz, .info, .be, .de, .com/net/org, .jp, .info and also all the fun domains with Ã„Ã–Ãœ when they come out in March. You also have full eMail forwarding, full redirection of your domains as well as control over all the revelevant DNS entries if you want to go that far.

&lt;B&gt;Update 2:&lt;/B&gt; They are part of Lycos Europe since January 2004 and while I did previously think they were part of United Internet, they are not, even though the name makes it quite confising. I put my ramblings on United Internet in a seperate post then :)
