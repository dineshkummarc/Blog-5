Christian Lindholm, who is going to Yahoo!, had is [going away party](http://www.christianlindholm.com/christianlindholm/2005/09/what_a_great_le.html) from Nokia with a few collegues and as a gift, he seems to have received a Nokia Blink - Life-Recording Glasses (pictured [here](http://www.christianlindholm.com/photos/uncategorized/17380_image178jpg.jpg)). While it sounds very cool I have the assumption that it is just a gift to him and not a real system that will go into the stores soon... but we will see soon, unless somebody can enlight me now. I had enough of excitement for a day ;)
