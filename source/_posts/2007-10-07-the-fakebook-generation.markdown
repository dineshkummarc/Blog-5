Great article in the New York Times by Alice Mathias, 2007 graduate of Dartmouth, entitled &quot;[The Fakebook Generation](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/opinion/06mathias.html?_r=1&amp;ex=1349409600&amp;en=465bad38b9d8bd6c&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin)&quot;. I'll just do a quick post because it fits in nicely with &quot;[Facebook just a Fad](http://blog.thylmann.net/2007/10/03/facebook-just-a-fad/)&quot; posted a few days ago.

I have to admit that [Xing](http://xing.com/) is yet one of the platforms I mostly _use_, not play with, _use_. Facebook is fun but I wouldn't use it to look for contact info on somebody. It's more about following the live of your friends and there might be better ways to do that. It's a thought provoking little piece. Go read.
