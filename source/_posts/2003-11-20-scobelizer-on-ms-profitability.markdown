Sometimes Scobelizer has some very good posts in his endless stream of rumblings (sometimes it just gets too much man! ;)) [This is definitely one of them](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/11/20.html#a5544). Read the article by Cringley he links to first to get the full idea of what it is all about. Both are very good!
