It seems that the HipTop by [Danger](http://www.danger.com/) is [coming to Germany](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/68/33500.html). More specifically to E-Plus. As I already said some time ago in an article on [infoSync](http://www.infosync.no/), it will be hard for Danger to land a deal in Germany though because of the GPRS flat-rate requirement for the Danger HipTop. The thing is that the device synchronizes everything you do with a Server and therefore you need a GPRS flatrate as you cannot really control your expenses otherwise. Now E-Plus in Germany has jumped on the train and will offer a GPRS flatrate with the device. Jummy. I will have to look at this, even though I don't really like the HipTop too much :)
