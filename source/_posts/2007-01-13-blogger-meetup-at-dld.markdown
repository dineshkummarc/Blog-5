The wonderful [Robert Basic](http://www.basicthinking.de/) has together with [Klaus Eck](http://klauseck.typepad.com/prblogger/) organized a [Blogger Meetup at DLD](http://www.basicthinking.de/blog/2007/01/10/dld-blog-treffen-am-2101-1930-steht-fest). Obviously [Henning](http://henninglange.com/) and me will be there as well as a large group of other people. Who do we have... for one [Lyssa](http://www.lyssas-lounge.de/peepshow/), who has the great and hard task to bring WAZ Online to success, [Martin Varsavsky](http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/) together with the head of FON Europe Robert Lang, Cam Basman ([Outsourcing Blog](http://basman.wordpress.com/)) whom I met the first time at one of the first WebMontags in Cologne (he sponsored beer, thanks :)), of course [Nico Lumma](http://lumma.de/), [Oliver Wagner](http://www.agenturblog.de/), Robert is trying to get [Caterina Fake](http://www.caterina.net/) and [Craig Newmark](http://cnewmark.com/) to show up, [Heiko](http://hebig.com/) (one of the organizers of DLD) is coming, [Nicole](http://beissholz.de/), &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;http://hemartin.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Hugo E. Martin&lt;/a&gt; (looking forward to have a chat with one of the most interesting guy coming from the print business), &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.roell.net/&quot;&gt;Martin RÃ¶ll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.openbc.com/&quot;&gt;Daniela&lt;/a&gt; from OpenBC, and I can finally buy&lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.floriandargel.org/&quot;&gt; Florian Dargel&lt;/a&gt; a beer :). And obviously there are lots of other people! All in all a great crowd.
