Another thing in relation to Charlie's Angels full throttle, the new movie. I have rarely seen a movie with so much branding. Boy oh boy! I mean they see a footprint on the floor and say something like &quot;That's the Air Jordan from Nike, it's very rare and was only sold at Foot Locker in Nebraska.&quot; or something like that. Then you suddenly see them send arround pictures for no apparent reason I can remember and you see T-Mobile huge on a notebook screen, T-Mobile t-zones actually, something that would surely be used by high tech special agents. Then you see motorcycles and BIG Yamaha prints on the side. Lots of stuff like this, amazing. I wonder how much money they made through the branding alone.
