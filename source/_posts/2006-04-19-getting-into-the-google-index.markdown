JenSense [posted about it](http://www.jensense.com/archives/2006/04/adsense_mediapa.html) a few days ago and now it seems that [Matt Cutts confirmed it](http://www.jensense.com/archives/2006/04/matt_cutts_conf.html). The Mediabot from Google, the one used for the AdSense targeting is also being used to add sites to the Google Index, before only served via the standard Google Bot. While it does not seem to have a result on ranking, it might get you in the index faster.
