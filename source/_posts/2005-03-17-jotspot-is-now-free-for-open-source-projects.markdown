I've been using JotSpot a bit more in recent days and it has really grown. My old account somehow stayed in notbeingupdated world and hence I was a bit surprised when I signed up for a new beta account for another project and found so much cool stuff going on. There are now groups, customization, lots more apps, word and excel import into pages, nice work with tables in general, anonymous access, ... . And now they announced another really cool feature, being that [JotSpot Is Free for Open Source Projects](http://blog.jot.com/archives/2005/03/12/jotspot-is-free-for-open-source-projects/). Now how cool is that ey? Get a killer Wiki for your Open Source Project, and a hosted one at that. Congratulations for the move JotPeople. :)
