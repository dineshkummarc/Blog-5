&lt;p&gt;A man in slovakia cam of the road and was burried under 3 meters of snow. All he had to save himself were 60 bottles of beer. He drank and peed himself to freedom. Not sure if I have to believe this but it's a fun story :) Source: [The Sun Newspaper Online](http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2005042739,00.html).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: It was a joke. See [here](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/02/03/avalanche_man_debunked/).&lt;/p&gt;
