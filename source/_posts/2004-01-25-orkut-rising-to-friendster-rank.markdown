Thanks to the &lt;a title=&quot;License-Exempt Soweto: Update on Orkut Juggernaut&quot; href=&quot;http://www.rafer.net/blog/000246.html&quot;&gt;License-Exempt Soweto: Update on Orkut Juggernaut post, I checked out [the Alexa comparison of Orkut and Friendster](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=3m&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=friendster.com&amp;url=orkut.com) and boy is Orkut rising fast. It is now already the 505th most used site on the net, which is amazingly high, especially considering that they only just started. 

Also interesting to note is that Orkut seems to be called &quot;Project Eden&quot; inside Google, something that is also hinted on [John Battelle's post about Orkut](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000261.php). 

I do have to say though that having it invite only makes Orkut a bit special and seeing your network grow is fun, more so than at LinkedIn because it is just more open, more sharing.
