We have a real fight on our hands. Michael [wrote](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/13/joie-de-vivre-the-europeans-are-out-to-lunch/) about Le Web saying that Europeans don't work hard enough or something. [Read](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/13/joie-de-vivre-the-europeans-are-out-to-lunch/) it for yourself, especially the comments. Then loic [answered](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2008/12/should-michael.html) (I will revisit that post later becuase it rocks) and ended up top on Techmeme. Then Michael [answered](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/13/le-webs-response-to-techcrunch-censorship/) in a pissed way about the pool de-inviting him from the next Le Web.

One thing that should be clear for everyone is that this is something that will drive up the press for loic, michael, techcrunch, seesmic, le web, and so on. So it's all fun and games and they will continue to go out for dinner. Above that, Michael will continue to let himself be treated to first class tickets to france and dinners at the best restaurants in the world because reporting from tech conferences IS HIS JOB! So stop complaining michael that you might not go next year and not send people over. Le Web by now is big and something to be reported on. So all the mumbo jumbo about not reporting on Le Web is bull.

Next to that It's a great number of posts to read, really. The important thing is that Michael gets it totally wrong. The idea by Loic that we go to have 2 hours of lunch is just said to make a point. Relationships are deeper here in many cases. Above that, it's not about what you push into it, it's about what comes out at the other end that is important. No matter how much you work, the end result is important. And if somebody makes it on 2 hours while somebody else takes 8, then that's something called productivity. If Michael being on the Golf Course for 3 hours per week for a few months, makes him close a 2 million deal EUR ad deal from P&amp;G, then I doubt he would see those 3 hours as wasted.

Yes, we do not have as a powerful echo chamber here in Europe as the US has, but that doesn't make companies here less successful. Above that, I'd love to get an index on all the companies that Techcrunch wrote about to see what kind of revenues they make or if they are bankrupt. But that again wouldn't be important.

All involved, please continue talking and writing in public, it is a blast.

And as for Wifi at such a conference, I just thought Chaos Communication Conference might be something to learn from but as I just learned the money Loic spent wouldn't even go a bit of the way for the people they have there and the hardware. Real dedicated geeks are just unbeatable :)
