Cingely argues in his latest column entitled [The Walt Within](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20060202.html) that Disney really only bought Pixar to get Steve. Might actually be true a little bit. Here is a great point:
*
For the entertainment industries, the next 10 years will be the most revolutionary in a century.  Broadcast TV as we knew it is going away, replaced by a Chinese entertainment menu of such complexity that even knowing what's &quot;on&quot; tonight will be beyond the abilities of most viewers.  At some point, too, movies will be subsumed into television and recorded music will find its own new place with new rules.  This will be Steve Jobs's world and we'll all just be visitors.  It's obvious to me and, evidently, to Iger, too.
&lt;em /&gt;*

**Oh the revolutions we are about to see.
