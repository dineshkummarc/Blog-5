Want to learn more about where Instant Messaging is going in the future? Thanks to [nico](http://lumma.de/mt/archives/000734.html) I just found a [very good interview/article about IM](http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=89) staring Peter Ford from Microsoft and Eric Allman from Sendmail. Interesting couple. Interesting conversation.
