I am not sure how I got [this book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380789035/) anymore, and it sure was fitting a bit to the style of writing I like. The problem is that the story was too weird and actually too little. You didn't want to read it to know what would happen next, but more or less only because you wanted it to end. It has some good twists and some wonderful character plays but the twists just don't make you go &quot;WOW&quot;. If you are into Gods this should be interesting, but if you are not you might miss some of the deeper meaning behind what some of the characters do. This is likely also why I didn't get too much out of this one. Oh, so he is Odin. Ok, he has 20 other names. Ok. Let's go on please. 

In short, a special book, with much insight, little story and a very good writing style. Keep an eye on the author.
