I saw [Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle](http://www.imdb.com/Title?0305357) yesterday and boy was it a bad movie. I mean over the top action can be good but 100% unbelievable action is too much. On top of that the film has absolutely no consistent story and if there is a story it is much too hard to follow. It seems that it's more a puzzle of several stories. In other movies the bad guy is not clear and you change your view who the bad guy is frequently with twists in the plot. Here, the bad guy simply changes from one person to the next. The Angels looked great though :)
