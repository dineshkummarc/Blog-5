&lt;a&gt; home&quot; href=&quot;http://www.newbay.com/&quot;&gt;NewBay is developing, or has developed, something they call FoneBlog. It enables blogging via Mobile phones. This is something I still want to enable with MovableType and something that should really not be that hard. This would bring blogging to another level. I already wrote about it [here](http://www.infosync.no/show.php?id=2583).
