The date is out.

Loic just [posted](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2006/10/lesblogs3_save_.html) about Les Blogs 3 in Paris. It will happen 11th to 12th of December.

When I think about it, the investment we finally got with Ormigo was quasi because of Les Blogs 2 last year. It took a few steps from there but this is where it started.

Looking forward to seeing you there.
