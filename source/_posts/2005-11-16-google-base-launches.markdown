As seen [on the Google Blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/11/first-base.html), [Google Base](http://base.google.com/) has launched and [John is thrilled](http://battellemedia.com/archives/002033.php). Others seem to be a little more skeptical but we will see.

In the meantime, Google is also advertising Google Analytics in their blogs and I actually still know no one that has their reports displayed. Search Engine Roundtable has [more info on reports not being displayed](http://www.seroundtable.com/archives/002806.html).

... [Henning](http://www.henninglange.com/) just walked in the door. He has stats! Of course, his 2 PIs are easy to count ;)
