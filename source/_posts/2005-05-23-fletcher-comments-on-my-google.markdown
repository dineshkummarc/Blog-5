Mark Fletcher, CEO of Bloglines, has written a good comments on Google Fusion entitled: &lt;a title=&quot;Google Launches My Google, World Does Not End&quot; href=&quot;http://www.wingedpig.com/archives/000204.html&quot;&gt;Google Launches My Google, World Does Not End. It's actually about my problem with Yahoo!'s RSS implementation as well. The thing is that they use it just as a tool  to display information, but leave out the  status part of this information. If I put an RSS feed on my MyYahoo! page, then I can  just say how many headlines I want to see. That's the number of last headlines I will see then, whether they are read or not, whether I already saw them or not. Mark Fletcher really didn't do anything too amazing with Bloglines, I mean most RSS Readers for the Desktop work like Bloglines does, but now Google does Fusion and the headlines you can integrate again remain the top X of them. That just doesn't work! I don't want to see the top 3 articles from 150 Feeds I have in Bloglines! You need to aggregate them together, make them one, group them, only show new items, notify of updates, all those things. You actually just need to do anything that a machine can do that I would otherwise do. A machine can't read for me (if I don't want to listen), but other than that, there is a lot it can do.

Let's see what the RSS implementation of Google will look like when it comes out.
