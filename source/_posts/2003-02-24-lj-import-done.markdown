Done. I finally managed to put all my old [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/) files. This only worked thanks to the conversion done by [LJ2MT](http://lj2mt.sourceforge.net/), or rather, by the coder of the script. Sadly I did not get the system to run on my server thanks to some missing modules, but it was done for me and many thanks are due here. I now have posts dating back to February 2001, including my [first post](http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000120.php), which was actually done on LiveJournal. I even managed to categorize everything again. This is something that I really like about MovableType, the categorization. I need to work out a good system though without too many distinct categories. Still needs some thinking that. Now off to work.
