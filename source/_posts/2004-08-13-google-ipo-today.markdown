According to [this press release](https://www.ipo.google.com/press-release-20040812-1.html) we will have ourselves a Google IPO today. Then again, [News.com speculates](http://news.com.com/Google+revealed+in+Playboy+interview%3F/2100-1038_3-5307955.html?tag=nl) that [Playboy Interview](http://www.playboy.com/magazine/interview.html) out today might not be the best thing in the eyes of the SEC due to the quiet period that an IPO Company has to take before an IPO. It will be an interesting day.

&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: Some info summarized on the [Yahoo! Finance Special Edition on Google IPO](http://biz.yahoo.com/special/googleipo2.html). [[thanks Jeremy](http://www.ensight.org/archives/2004/08/13/google-ipo-day/)]
