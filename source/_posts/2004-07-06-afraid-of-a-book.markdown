This is the first time I am afraid of a book. I got the first two volumes of Neil Stephenson's Baroque Cycle and boy those are big. The first one is 927 pages, and it's a big book to start with! The second one is a bit smaller with &quot;only&quot; 832 pages. Why afraid? Knowing myself, knowing Neil Stephenson, I will likely find the book highly addictive and will not be able to stop reading until I am done. With a normal small book of 300-400 pages, that's ok. But here, I am talking about reading 1759 pages in one go, with a bit of sleep of course. Boy am I happy that the third cycle isn't out yet ;) I will likely have to let these wonders slip until the holiday end of this month.
