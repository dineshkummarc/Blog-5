There are lots of stories out there about [Gumball 3000](http://wwww.gumball3000.com/) which has just finished but [this one by Team 3ezer](http://www.gumball3000blog.com/2006/05/10/2006-gumball-3000-by-team-3ezer/) is a very good one I suggest to read to find out what trying to drive through Europe at 200km/h is like when all police people know that 150 cars will be doing that at exactly one specific date.
