They must be, they now have a global strategy meeting going on from the 10th to the 12th of this month, as [Loic moblogged](http://www.loiclemeur.com/moblog/2004/11/ah_its_here.html).

Expect some interesting things. Their recent deal with Kanoodle for contextual advertising on TypePad might bring us a free version of the system. Or they create a more easy to build branded solution (not that I know if their current one is hard to build, but it can always be easier). Then of course there is stuff like staffing needs, motivation, what to develop inhouse, linking typekey to sxip (made that one up ;)), route to going public, ... Heads are cooking. Brains are churning out ideas. Interesting times.
