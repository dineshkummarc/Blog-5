Once again, I have to thank [John Porcaro](http://johnporcaro.typepad.com/blog/) for linking to a great blog. &lt;a title=&quot;beyond bullets&quot; href=&quot;http://sociablemedia.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;beyond bullets&lt;/a&gt; by Cliff Atkinson is a great resource on learning more about how to improve on your PowerPoint skills. I followed the rants of some people how PowerPoints sucks and in general I did agree but I was not sure what the better route really was. Cliff will give you some very good ideas. Liking it.
