That's what IT Facts is reporting [here](http://www.itfacts.biz/index.php?id=P1764) and some things are especially interesting I have to say. For one with the increasing importance of a vision and strategy that everyone can buy into, the lack of capability in getting this across is frightening. The other thing that is shown there is that people want to be developed, they want to learn and get on in their lives and managers will have to find a way to develop them and potentially let them go, because there aren't as many steps in the ladder any more. Also important is that honesty and decisiveness are valued highly in good managers. The decisiveness bit is crucial here. You have to tell the truth and tell it correctly and not wiggle yourself through things. Bad things are bad and can be said to be bad if they are really bad and not good the next day. Think of it like raising children. If you tell a kid that something is bad and how things should be handled, then they know how to behave to be valued and that will make them feel good. It's really about creating an eco system where the ground rules are clear and relatively fixed and consistent. If you value creativity you can't punish somebody for talking a walk or resting on the green grass in front of the office in the sun during the day. It's a weird world out there for managers and it will only become weirder.
