Stuff is starting to get done. I just downloaded a driver so that my Archos Jukebox will now mount and I am currently transferring my MP3s over to the iBook which might take some time ;)

DragThing seems to be nice for managing my applications but I need to play with it a bit more. If I go to the top left edge it pops up to the front now which is nice enough. Right top is screensaver on, right bottom for it to stay off. DSL is working, local network to my desktop is working, Airport card still missing. 

Entourage is a great mail client and I would love to have Outlook do the same things.

I'll be trying out Mozilla a bit as it does not seem to be that slow and the tabbed view is nice. I still need to download Opera though and hope this will be the fastest as I use it on windows too. Sadly some sites just don't work in it.

My dock is now really empty only having launched apps in it, due to DragThing and holding CTRL and clicking the apps folder that I put next to the trash will give me something similar to a start menu. I am thinking about putting a few more folders there for more apps which might result in loosing drag thing again. Not sure.

Currently running on Battery since yesterday evening. 50 minutes left. Let's see what is done sooner, the iBook or the Jukebox ;)

I love the script menu too, there are some nice things there. I can for example minimize all apps but the finder with two clicks now, could make it one click but I need a special icon for that script first.

I finally decided that I will use iPhoto for my photos too as it is just too nice and I can export HTML sites for it to put them online. Sadly the homepage function only works with the iDisk and these are nicer than the sites it makes otherwise but I will see if I can work around that somehow. 

Still some things to settle but it is looking very good.
