Ever since I started to read [his blog](http://www.loiclemeur.com/) I got intrigued by [Loic](http://www.loiclemeur.com/)'s thought processes, hightened when I met him some time back. He is not the most inventive guy, I mean [Joi](http://joi.ito.com/) introduced him to blogging, but when it comes to innovation, connecting ideas and their potential effects, especially in the business world, he stands tall. He is also an amazing communicator, a true entrepreneur. Now he added another post in his series about founding a company and I have to say that it's a must read for all those that think business is about not making mistakes (read [here](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/07/the_power_of_ma.html) for my view on that one) and for those feeling that blogging is just a fad (see [here](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2002/11/blogging_goes_w.html) for my article on wireless blogging from 2002).

So for all those doubters: &lt;a title=&quot;Start a business - 7: Entrepreneurs do make mistakes, learn from them and react.
