Actually I should be saying [last.fm](http://last.fm), because it is really where all this is coming from. It's an amazing start-up and the IT team at Ormigo is raving about it. I still do not get to use it because I don't really like listening to random music at work. In comes [Slacker](http://slacker.com/). It's an amazing start-up with some real talent behind it that kind of makes your last.fm mobile. They are building a portable device, and best of all a [car stereo system](http://www.slacker.com/products.html). That system will use something similar to last.fm. You can say if you like or hate a song, and skip 6 songs per hour and have quasi personal radio through that.

The device will connect to the Slacker network through Satellite and and WiFi whenever a network is available and update the available songs on the internal hard disk. This means you always get fresh songs. Great stuff. I do want that in my car. I'd need two profiles but still :)

The next step then is that I will have a preferred list of some podcast like some special news, some comedy, and more, and that will be played first. Only then I get some random songs. That would and actually will, totally change your radio listening experience, and the cool thing is ... you will be able to buy the song with the press of a button. Oh the world is interesting.
