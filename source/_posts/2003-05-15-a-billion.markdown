Again something from TMF. so how do you understand the number &quot;billion&quot;. A US ad agency put it like this. 

*A billion seconds ago it was 1959. 

A billion minutes ago Jesus was alive 

A billion hours ago our ancestors were living in the Stone Age. 

A billion dollars ago was only 8 hours and 20 minutes, at the rate Washington spends it. *
