Now I know what Mathematicians do all day. This is what I received today.

First we state that girls require time and money:

Girls = Time x Money

As we all know &quot;time is money&quot;:

Time = Money

Therefor:

Girls = Money x Money = (Money) ^ 2

And because &quot;money is the root of all evil&quot;:

Money = Squareroot(Evil)

Therefor:

Girls = ( Squareroot(Evil) ) ^ 2

And we are forced to conclude that:

Girls = Evil

;)
