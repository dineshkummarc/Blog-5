It seems that Naomi Wolf, famous in the US, has written an article about porn called [The Porn Myth](http://nymetro.com/nymetro/news/trends/n_9437/index.html). She's an into porn activist mind you. Eric Raymond posted &lt;a title=&quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot; href=&quot;http://armedndangerous.blogspot.com/2003_10_26_armedndangerous_archive.html#106742309106499008&quot;&gt;a wonderful rebuttal&lt;/a&gt; to her piece. Here is an example:

&lt;I&gt;Here's another secret about most men, most of the time: given a choice between a buff &quot;porn-worthy&quot; chick with a drawerful of sex toys who's grudging or unresponsive in bed, or a plain jane with rudimentary technique who orgasms easily and generously, plain jane is the one we're going to go back to. Again, this has a sound basis in evolutionary bio; orgasm is a sperm-retention behavior that increases the probability of conception, so an orgasming woman is saying pre-verbally &quot;I want your child!&quot;.&lt;/I&gt;
