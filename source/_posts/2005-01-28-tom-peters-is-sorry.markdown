He held a speech in front of lots of CEOs which he called idiots it seems. He compiled a list why or when the are idiots which he put in a powerpoint slide at a presentation:

[...]

1. Fail to spend Hyper-aggressively on IS/IT; fail to follow &quot;Gamechanger&quot; IS/IT Strategies; fail to put their CIO on the Board; fail to exploit fully [Revolution Now!] the Web.
2. Believe in [BIG] mergers as The Key to Offense &amp; Defense.
3. Hire MBAs in large #s.
4. Recruit mostly from conventional sources; have a low tolerance for risktakers-freaks.
5. Are less than 24/7 &quot;Talent Fanatics.&quot;
6. Do too much Imitation/Benchmarking/ConstantImprovement, not enough &quot;Breathtaking&quot;/Disruptive Innovation; favor &quot;marketshare&quot; over MarketCreation.
7. Believe that &quot;process&quot; beats &quot;passion,&quot; &quot;analysis&quot; beats &quot;action.&quot;
8. Spend too much time in the Office, not enough time in the Field; fail to ColdCall at least One Customer per Week; are surrounded by sycophants; have low Tolerance for Contention.
9. ARE NOT LOVED BY FRONTLINE STAFF!
10. Do too much MicroSegmentation I: Grotesquely underestimate the Women's Marketâ€”and if they do more or less &quot;get it,&quot; fail to understand the Strategic Transformation required to master it.
11. Do too much MicroSegmentation II: Grotesquely underestimate the Boomer-Geezer Market.
12. Have too few Women on the Executive Team, too few Women on the Board.
13. Who's ... Board = OWMs. 
14. Balk at Technicolor actions and languageâ€”e.g., WOW!, Lovemarks, DreamMarketing, InsanelyGreat. 
15. Think Design is a frill, nicetyâ€”not the Fundamental Basis for Value Added.
16. Tolerate less than Excellence, do not insist upon &quot;Experiences that make me 'Gasp.'&quot;
17. Deliver more on Short-term Earnings rather than Long-term Yearnings. 
18. FAIL TO INSPIRE ME BY THE AUDACITY OF THEIR DREAMS. (Too much: &quot;Dream&quot; = &quot;Buy MarketShare, Get BIGGER, Cut Costs.&quot;)
