Thank to &lt;a title=&quot;I Am There @ Oliver Willis: Like Kryptonite to Stupid&quot; href=&quot;http://www.oliverwillis.com/entries/1203/i_am_there.html&quot;&gt;Oliver Willis' post&lt;/a&gt;, I just watched the [new Spiderman](http://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/sony/spiderman2/) trailer and it rocks. And as Oliver (Willis not me ;)) found out, they also [had a blog on set](http://spiderman.sonypictures.com/go.php?path=%2Fbugle%2Fweblogs%2Findex.php%3F).
