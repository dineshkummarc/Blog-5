Blogg.de seems to be getting some traction recently. Nico just announced that the influential german newspaper [WirtschaftsWoche](http://www.wiwo.de) (WiWo in short) has started several blogs by authors of the paper. You can find the main blog site at [blog.wiwo.de](http://blog.wiwo.de/) and all the blogs run on the platform of [Blogg.de](http://www.blogg.de). Congratulations to Nico for the catch. The one that already made by RSS Feeds is the [Silicon Valley Observer](http://blog.wiwo.de/silicon-valley/) by Matthias Hohensee which is the most bloggish of their list. It feels like he is speaking personally which is what makes it a joy to read.
