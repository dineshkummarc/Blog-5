Today I gave myself a little gift, it being an [Odyssey DFX 2-Ball Putter](http://www.odysseygolf.com/en/product.aspx?pid=2ball.dfx&amp;scroll=-92), and boy is this one a beauty. It's amazingly balanced, has a very nice feel, and the two white round shapes at the top help even the brainless to shove the ball in the right direction. :) And Odyssey has a very good text writer on their site. Check [The Beginning](http://www.odysseygolf.com/en/beginning.aspx):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Putting. It's a game within a game. One with many challengers. But few masters. It's where three feet can feel like three inches. It's where muscle strength doesn't matter. But mental strength does. And if you don't control this game. This game controls you. Welcome to Odyssey. It's time to even the score.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Looking forward to trying this out on the next round.
