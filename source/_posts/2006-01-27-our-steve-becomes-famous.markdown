Ok, famous might be too much but our own [Steve Dix](http://www.stevedix.de/) has been played on [The Daily Source Code 323](http://www.shownotes.info/wiki/DSC_323) by [Adam Curry](http://www.curry.com/). The song in question is [The Girl With The Sunshine in Her Eyes](http://music.podshow.com/music/listeners/searchResults.php?pageNum_Searchresults=1&amp;totalRows_Searchresults=23&amp;SearchString=sunshine&amp;go2=Search+Keywords) and Adam Curry even had some good comments about Steve. Congratulations my friend.
