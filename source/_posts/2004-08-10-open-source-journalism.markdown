that's a term that Dan Gillmor used at a session at OSCON and Jeremy Zawodny summarised it a bit [right here](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/002289.html). There are some very interesting things in there. For one, it is starting to become true that digital cameras and video cameras are everywhere, and there seems to have been a picture on some blog of debris coming back down to earth after the shuttle brake-up, that the mainstream media never carried. SARS got first published through SMS and then the story just spread. You can't kill a story anymore. You can't control PR. Interesting stuff. Thanks for the summary Jeremy.
