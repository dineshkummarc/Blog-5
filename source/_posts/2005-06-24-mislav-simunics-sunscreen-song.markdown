[Ralf](http://www.design-management.de/), my Strategy Tutor, just sent me a link to &lt;a title=&quot;mislav simunic's sunscreen song&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hika.hr/~mislavs/docs/ssong.htm&quot;&gt;mislav simunic's sunscreen song&lt;/a&gt;, which I knew already but it is always good to hear again. 

Here are some examples:

&lt;I&gt;Don't worry about the future or worry that know that worrying is as affective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum.&lt;/I&gt;
[...]
&lt;I&gt;Don't waste your time on jealously, sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. 
The race is long and in the end, it's only with yourself. &lt;/I&gt;
[...]
&lt;I&gt;Don't feel guilty if you don't know what to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives, some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't. &lt;/I&gt;
[...]
&lt;I&gt;Accept certain alible truths: prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old and when you do, you'll fanaticise that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders. &lt;/I&gt;

Great stuff!
