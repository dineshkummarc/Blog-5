Sometimes it really sucks not living in the United States. This time it is because of the new Living Colour Album. Provided I'd live in the USA, I could go [here](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000CABCN/) to Amazon.com, order the Album and get instant access to a streaming version. Not available for international customers. Damn Damn Damn!!!

The album is already rank 231 in Germany though, which is nice.
