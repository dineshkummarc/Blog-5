I had a very good first day at Les Blogs and I had some wonderful chats with people and am looking forward to more on day two. The panels are already starting well. The party, given to us with an open bar by [Edelman](http://www.edelman.com/) (thanks!), was at a very nice venue and I'd call it a success, even though they were out of beer at 21:30!!! They were out of beer! Ok, maybe because we are in Paris we should drink wine anyway, but that probably made it more expensive for Edelman as people started drinking Vodka Tonic and other things. Probably a supply side problem, but still very weird. Sadly the party didn't last too long and it was emptying out around midnight, and I was thrown out with the last 2 people at 1:30 am.

It's already nice to see that this day starts out with more discussion and more diverse opinions and it is not all shiny anymore. Will become a good day. Oh, and you notice that it's a geeky crowd, with a quick scan giving me more than 20 different bluetooth devices that all have a real name. :)
