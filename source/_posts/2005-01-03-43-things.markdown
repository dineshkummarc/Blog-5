[Different](http://www.ensight.org/archives/2005/01/02/43-things-in-the-morning/) [people](http://nico.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=1097) are posting about [43 Things](http://www.43things.com/) but the first time I heard about it was [from Fred's log](http://bornholz.typepad.com/blog/2004/12/thank_you_37sig.html) mid December and I started to get interested in the new service back then. Sadly it fell through the cracks and I stopped looking at it but now I am really starting to get it. As Ingmar says, thanks 37signals! Those are the people behind [Basecamp HQ](http://www.basecamphq.com/) and they seem to have started another success. What is [43 Things](http://www.43things.com)?
