I just read via [John's post](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000914.php) that [Furl.net](http://www.furl.net/) has been [sold to Looksmart](http://www.furl.net/letter.jsp). Congratulations to Mike. It sounds like a wonderful deal! It will allow him to scale a lot better. For one, each member now has 5GB of storage for their furled public items. Very nice.
