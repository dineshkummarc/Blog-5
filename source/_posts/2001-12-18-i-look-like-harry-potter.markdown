Now it is out, I look like Harry Potter. Scot Hacker has published an article about his trip from BeOS to MacOS X and that got the BeOS fanatics talking again. And as I was doing BeNews with Scot I am in it too now ;)

Some people just don't like to hear that BeOS is dead.

Well here is one post from the Yahoo BEOS stock board:

 Hey screw Hacker the little sissy. Nothing has changed and we still might come out ahead if Palm only agrees to payout a share dividend to Us, the current Be shareholders. Hacker had one big problem getting the word out with Be, he continuously courted the NERD crowd and could never get it on with normal Joe's. &lt;B&gt;So, he wasn't the right spokesman -- same for that punk over at BeNews, the Harry Potter lookalike Oliver.&lt;/B&gt;

None of the past will matter as long as Palm finds their balls somewhere and turns into a man and plays fair with past shareholders. If they don't, a new OS will come along -- it's certainly not time to start the Mac crap again (buy a new Mac, what a freaken joke, especially in this depression we're in). Say bye bye to Mac OS, remember, Hacker lives in the world of lllong nerds, sorry guy... 

&lt;/I&gt;

Sorry for not having a clouded mind people of the Yahoo Message boards ;)
