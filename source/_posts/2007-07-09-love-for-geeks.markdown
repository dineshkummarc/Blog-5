You have to have Love for Geeks, partly because they love Apple and hence love the iPhone. Bill Liao from Xing is one of those people and now he posted about having his [iPhone here in Europe](http://blog.xing.com/2007/07/iphone-mania.html). Having made some money down the line, surely helps to cover the cost of constant roaming, but hey, I still have to thank him.

For some time, one of the main features I wanted from Xing was an export of all my contacts as a vCard to import into the Apple Address Book. Now Bill got his iPhone and wanted his contacts on there, hence, diverted a few development resources and now in your [Address list on Xing](https://www.xing.com/app/contact) you have a small little button that says &quot;mobile export (iPhone) ...&quot;. What that thing does is export a vCard of all your contacts, which again, easily imports to my address book. 312 Contacts imported, 149 duplicates will be updates. Kick ass! Thanks Bill for getting an iPhone :)
