Some nice [FON](http://fon.com/) news today. First of all I am one of the [good foneros](http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/fon/fiesta-fonera.html) and hence got the Fontenna for 2 EURs. The Fontenna extends my FON signal five times and due to the fact that across the lake from my home they are building a beach club, this might make sense. :)

Additionally, the difference between Linus and Bills seems to have been removed and now [you can make money](http://www.fon.com/en/info/makeMoney) either way. Choose to be a Bill and you can make money at your own hotspot and roam for free. Nice and makes sense actually. Third, but this does not seem to be online yet, WifiAds are a further monetization part of the entire system that has something to do with ads. We'll see what that is all about.

Also you can now add FON Hotspots to your GPS and there is a new Symbian client out. All good things. I am looking forward to try out the new Fontenna when it arrives to see if I reach the [beachclub](http://www.ksta.de/html/bildpopup/1179/818561774.shtml) :)
