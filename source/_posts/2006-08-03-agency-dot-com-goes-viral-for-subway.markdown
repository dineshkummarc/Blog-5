ExperienceCurve posts on [how Agency.com pitched Subway via YouTube](http://blog.experiencecurve.com/archives/why-agencycom-totally-nailed-the-subway-pitch), which is a video the agency produced to create something viral to show Subway they're worth being their Agency.

Great stuff, and [thanks for the pointer](http://www.hebig.com/archives/003925.shtml) Heiko.

P.S.: Already bought the [t-shirt](http://www.spreadshirt.net/shop.php?op=article&amp;article_id=3404773#) :)
