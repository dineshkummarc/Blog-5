Interesting post by Mark Fletcher from Bloglines about [Giving Up](http://www.wingedpig.com/archives/000169.html). What he means is that if you try to get a typical career your life will be about getting more control, more power, more people, more money, ... all that stuff. If you however found a company, this is not what it will be like. You will have to give stuff up. You start with everything and then suddenly other people need to make decisions, other people need part ownership of the company, ... . Pretty logical, pretty basic, should be obvious, but isn't until you see it written.
