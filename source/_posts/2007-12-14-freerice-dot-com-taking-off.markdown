I found this one via [Paradigm Shift](http://plentyoffish.wordpress.com/2007/12/13/the-next-huge-site/), check it out: [FreeRice](http://freerice.com/). It's a simple concept. For every question you answer right, they get a page view and you kind of give (via them) 20 grains of rice. They pay for that via advertising. I needed to dig a little deeper into their numbers:

	* One grain of rice weighs about 20-30mg.
	* 20 grains of rice weigh about  0.6g
	* you need over 1660 plays on the site to play 1kg of rice
	* if I have found it correctly, [one tonne of rice](http://www.guardian.co.uk/feedarticle?id=7149821) costs roughly $340, so one kg about $0.34
	* they need a cpm of 20 cents to come out even if they can buy wholesale.
	* based on their [stats](http://freerice.com/totals.html) they gave  8,294,816,130 grains of rice, so
	* 414,740,806 hits on the site or 20 grain portions, however you want to see it.
	* Based on the 1660 plays above for a kg of rice,
	* they gave away roughly 250 tons of rice already

Not bad for a site that is only for just a little time. Let's hope they do what they do :)
