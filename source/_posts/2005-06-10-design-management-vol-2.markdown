My wonderful strategy tutor Ralf Beucker has launched &lt;a title=&quot;Vol. 2: the design management weblog :&quot; href=&quot;http://www.design-management.de/&quot;&gt;:: Vol. 2: the design management weblog :&lt;/a&gt;. I remember talking to him about blogging in the Strategy course 2 years ago and was very happy to see he took it up with full force. One day I will take one of his new courses, but for now, there are other matters that require my full attention. Check out his blog and subscribe. Great stuff coming in from him!
