Karl Lagerfeld was in an interview yesterday here in german television. This man is amazing, period. He just perfectly knows what he wants and is not afraid to say so.

Just some quotes, from my head.

Question: &quot;Are you afraid of death?&quot;
Answer: &quot;Billions of people have died before me. Billions of people died after me. It can't be that bad.&quot;
Question: &quot;But what do you want to be remembered by, do you want a museum or something?&quot;
Answer: &quot;Oh no, I live now, I never followed some great ideal, I just wanted to have a good living. Me starts with me and ends with me. After me the flood.&quot;

Question: &quot;Are there any similarities between you and your sister?&quot;
Answer: &quot;No, not at all. She is a very caring person. She helps the poor and homeless and things. I just help myself. I am very much an egoist.&quot;

Question: &quot;You lost 42 kilos...&quot; (60 kilos now)
Answer: &quot;I feel very good now, actually, I wear pants that some of the people I work with don't fit in. That's very funny and conforting. It shouldn't be really as it is not important, but you need to get your fun somehow ;)&quot;

Question: &quot;You have 230000 books, what aobout pride in owning them?&quot;
Answer: &quot;I actually don't know how many books I have, my computers tell me I have 230000, I never counted them. I read a lot and my favorites are at all my places. Other's are just somewhere on call if I want them. I actually don't think there is a pride in owning them. Owning something is boring, the collecting is the fun part. Once you have what you wanted to collect it gets boring. [...] I also think I like paper and that probably runs deep. When I was young, good drawing paper was rare with most of my paper coming over from the US from uncles. They told me to draw on the backside too but I promised myself early on that I would never do that. I also can't throw it away. I now have more drawing paper than I could possibly use in more than one lifetime.&quot;

Weird guy, but very shure in what he knows, believes to know and thinks.
