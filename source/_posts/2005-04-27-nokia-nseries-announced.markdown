Nokia has just announced the &lt;a title=&quot;Nokia | Nseries&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nokia.com/nseries/&quot;&gt;Nokia Nseries. Christian [writes a bit about the N90](http://www.christianlindholm.com/christianlindholm/2005/04/nokia_n90_is_a_.html), which sports a Tessar lens from Zeiss, coming in at 2M pixels. Some really nice ones, including the N91 which has 4GB storage for music. I wondered what Nokia would do in the future as they ran out of numbers for their phones. Now I have it. Nxx :)
