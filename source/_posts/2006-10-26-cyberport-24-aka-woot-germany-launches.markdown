[Cyberport](http://cyberport.de) just announced on [their blog](http://www.cyberbloc.de/index.php?/site/comments/cyberport24_blogshopping_more/) that they have launched [Cyberport.24](http://www.cyberport24.de/). They got the idea from [Woot!](http://www.woot.com/) and the adapted idea is simple.

They will each week place 2 different products online for 2 days with a good reduction. Now they have a bluetooth stick for 10 EURs online and 36 pieces are left at the time of this writing. First come first served, like at Woot!. I suggest you subscribe to the [rss feed of Cyberport.24](http://www.cyberport24.de/index.php?/site/rss_2.0/), as some interesting things might come along.

I would have expected them to launch with something a little bit more exciting than a bluetooth stick though.
