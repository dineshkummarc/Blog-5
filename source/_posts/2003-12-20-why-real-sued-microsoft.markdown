Andrew Orlowski from The Register, has written an oppinion piece (and Andrew has some strong opinions, so take everythin with a grain of salt ;)) about &lt;a title=&quot;The Register&quot; href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/34619.html&quot;&gt;why Real sued Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. It all sounds pretty logical and was one of the better articles I have read about it.
