There is a new Bloglines feature, [References](http://www.bloglines.com/about/news#56). What that means is that if you get an entry within your bloglines account on any feed your are reading and others have already referenced it, you will see the reference count with the story. Clicking it will show you all the references. Really nice to get the full picture in a bigger story I have to say. Great stuff.
