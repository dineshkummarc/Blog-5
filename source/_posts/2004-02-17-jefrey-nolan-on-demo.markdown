Jefrey Nolan from [SAP Ventures](http://sapventures.typepad.com/) has a good post of some of what is going on at Demo 2004. Read the full post [here](http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2004/02/blogging_from_d.html).

A few comments follow:

[XKey](http://www.seasidesw.com/products/xkey.htm) from Seaside Software really does look like a cool product. If you are using Exchange and want to take everything with you, all you need is this little USB Dongle and a computer with an enabled USB port and you have all your information at your finger tips.
It's also interesting to hear that [SixApart](http://www.sixapart) is focusing only on personal users with [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com/). I do presume that for corporate blogging MovableType Pro will be the way to go which might even by a TypePad in a box.

I agree with Jefrey that [Oddpost](http://www.oddpost.com/) is a very good eMail client and I have been using them since [August 31st](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2003/08/oddpost_it_is.html) of last year. I do not really use the aggregator much but for eMail it rocks.

He mentions [WaveBlog](http://www.waveblog.com/) which is Russel Beattie's baby. Russel talks about it [here](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1006221.html). In general it's a blogging tool that would be integrated by carriers and allows for location awareness through capabilities available with mobile phones. What they do is take the 3 towers that your mobile phone always talks to and triangulate your position by that. It's pretty acurate really and doesn't need GPS. I'd really like to see location awareness within TypePad or rather attached to the pictures I make with my Nokia 6600. Then this would be really nice.

[Feedster](http://www.feedster.com/) seems to be in everyone's ears at the moment. They are doing some cool stuff as well as [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com). Both companies that should be checked out.

Thanks for the report Jefrey.
