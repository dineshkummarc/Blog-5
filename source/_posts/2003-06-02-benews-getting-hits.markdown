It seems that [BeNews](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.benews.com) is still getting hits these days. The site isn't online anymore, but as you see from the above URL, archive.org still has it in their catalogue, obviously, being an archive ;)

Today this comes from [an article](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=3692) on OSNews by Eugenia about YellowTABs revival of BeOS. For all those wondering what I am talking about. BeNews was a news site about BeOS that I was a part of for a long time until we pulled the plug. BeOS was an operating system that just rocked, but it still failed. The rest of the story would be too long for now, other than saying some people are trying to revive it. And hey, I wish them luck and especially fun.

I just found it's interesting to see how many hits archive.org can generate for a site.
