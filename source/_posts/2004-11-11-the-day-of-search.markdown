&lt;p&gt;Ok, this can be called a big day for search. Big for one, because Google increased it's index from roughly 5 billion to roughly 8 billion page as [ title=&quot;Google Blog&quot;&gt;posted on their blog](http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/11/googles-index-nearly-doubles.html). This alone is probably a big leap for their architecture and nice indeed. It coincides nicely with the launch of the [MSN Search Beta](http://beta.search.msn.com). The site is actually very nice, and it found out my location easily. What I think is good for the location bit though is that I can edit it if I want to. Microsoft also added the [Microsoft Search Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/msnsearch) and as [John Battelle posts](http://battellemedia.com/archives/001029.php) they are actually thinking about opening up the technology to create a kind of ecosystem where third parties can plug into the system and build cool applications. Google obviously already has their [public API](http://www.google.com/apis/) but this is just the start and there are endless of opportunities, especially if you allow people to play with the ranking algorithms and such. [Charlene Li's post](http://forrester.typepad.com/charleneli/2004/11/msn_search_debu.html) has some info that there is a natural language processer in there as well that will try to get some additional information out of what you asked. A very cool thing is their &lt;em&gt;Search Builder&lt;/em&gt; which allows you to play around in the search results. Nice to play around with.&lt;/p&gt;
