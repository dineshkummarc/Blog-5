John is [linking](http://battellemedia.com/archives/002481.php) to an [article on Lost Remote](http://www.lostremote.com/archives/008095.html) about Time Warner developing a kind of AdWords system for TV. This is something I have long expected and we are finally moving this way. With TV getting a backchannel, the distinction to the internet is getting marginalized. This again will push accountability into the TV market. Great.
