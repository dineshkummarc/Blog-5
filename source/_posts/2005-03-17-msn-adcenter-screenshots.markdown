Search Engine Lowdown has the [First Screenshots of MSN adCenter](http://www.searchenginelowdown.com/2005/03/first-screenshots-of-msn-adcenter.html) it seems. And they do look pretty nice. Still a question of usability is good but there seem to be some very nice statistics. It also includes audience profiles though it is unclear where that profiling comes from. All in all it seems to be an advanced copy of AdWords and I am looking forward to try it out to see if it beats AdWords in Usability. That's really one of the main problems with Overture's system as they usability (including speed and time to set a campaign live) is so damn poor you tend not to use it.
