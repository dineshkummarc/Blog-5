I would beg that this is not true but presume it is. Nico [posted an entry](http://nico.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=286) about a funny little detail that Toll-Collect revealed. For those not intheknow, Toll-Collect is a consortia of different big german companies that are trying to tackle the task of allowing the german state to collect money from trucks that use our german Autobahn. In itself, a good idea. It's just that they are overexpensive, delayed like hell, and seemingly a group of nutcases. Based on the [german story](http://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID3331810_REF1,00.html) linked at Nico's post, Toll Collect now said that they would need to know the fee to be collected relatively soon as it will be hardcoded into the machines set up inside the trucks!!! The On-Board-Units cannot be changed later on!!! I think I understand it. We put a fixed rate in on board units, which are then tracked with Cameras, wireless and satelite connections in all of Germany. Great stuff. This one will surely reach the MBA case study text books before too long :)
