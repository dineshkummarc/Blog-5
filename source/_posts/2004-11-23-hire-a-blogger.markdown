I just wrote [a post](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/11/your_job_blog.html) about using your blog to get a job and now Jeremy C. Wright goes to the extreme there in putting up [an eBay auction](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=5142129647) where you can kind of hire his bloging talent. That he has talent is known by now and the offer is interesting. If you are a company that has been thinking about all this bloging stuff and don't know how to attack the space, this is something for you. How do you blog? Which system do you use? What's a trackback? How do I allow my people to blog? Aren't there risks? What should I allow? Will this new voice kill me? Isn't it a fad? What will it add to my bottom line? These are just some of the questions Jeremy could help at. Above and beyond that he could get your started bloging. 

And if all that is not enough, it's a very cool idea and as Jeremy says in [this post](http://www.ensight.org/archives/2004/11/23/ebay-blogger-for-hire-auction/) you don't know if there is a market for it if you didn't try. That's the cool thing about this internet thingy. You can try stuff out amazingly easily. Prototype. Try. Play. Kill if it doesn't work. I like the spirit. Looking forward to see this evolve.
