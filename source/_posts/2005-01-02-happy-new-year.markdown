Greetings and a happy new year to all! Let 2005 begin, whoohoo!

Some predictions are a must for a blogger it seems so I will try a few just to start off the year.

- We will see a drive to more performance marketing on the internet, with integration going further down the value chain and syndicators and exchanges proliferating this year.
- Six Apart will go public towards the end of the year or at least announce plans to do so.
- Flickr will be bought by someone.
- Web Services will kick in overdrive with some big companies going deeper into the space, leveraging their communities.

To a good year for everyone.
