There we go. Eric Schmidt, Google CEO, said that [Orkut](http://www.orkut.com/) will be integrated into the Google Search services within a year, most likely, probably, maybe, possibly. Welcome the &quot;what my friends searched for&quot; feature and loads of other fun stuff. ([via News.com](http://news.com.com/2100-1026_3-5177233.html))

&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; I still believe that Google should buy [Furl](http://www.furl.net/) and integrate that too. [Google, Orkut, Furl, ... the three together will kick](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/01/orkut_google_fu.html).
