Ok. We had them build a stage yesterday, emm... rather, we saw them do it. Right in  front of our windows. We knew something was happening tomorrow (now  today) 1st of May.

We just ignored it for now. But then it started going. Moving into 1st of May is already a big party in Aachen. I learned more PHP all evening which was growing great. Went to sleep around 3 am and at 5 am sleep for temporarily over. Some freaks were banging on drums and playing guitar in front of our window. First I did not really notice it and in a state of half sleep I tried to match the drumming in some while loop or case statements. Hmmm... I might have overdone it with PHP last evening :)

Anyway. They finally stopped (after I tried to NOT put them in a while loop and kind of failed both in putting them in and not doing it) and I got some sleep. 

But around 9 am they started testing the audio system in front of our window with the same song over and over and over and over again. Grrr... so much for sleep this night. There is really no way you can sleep, or almost, as it is _really_ loud.

If you want to see what is going on here today, go [here](http://oliver.thylmann.com/photos-public/index.php?dir=20010501-unwanted_party_on_my_lawn). I will update this throughout the day.
