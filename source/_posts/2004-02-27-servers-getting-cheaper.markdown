1&amp;1, part of United Internet, has just reduced their prices on their [Root-Servers](http://hosting.1und1.de/PServSessionIdpt_de_DE=ac1704c18tSIMj4isTIg1hxSgPwBZPYF/xml/static?__page=root). You get a full server with backup capability of the entire HD and 75GB of Traffic for 69 EURs per month. You can even get two, connect them via the Serial Port and have full management capabilities if any one of them goes down. This is starting to be interesting if you start some kind of company I think. Just add a few ones if you need more power, adding 20.000 if you want to play Google and only pay 1.2 million a month (probably less with discounts ;)) and run lots of stuff via Akamai. And 1&amp;1 is also available in the US now too. You could even spread stuff via different data centers and take F5 Network gear to balance it arround the world.
