[Ingmar](http://bornholz.typepad.com/) just had a few songs playing and when asking him what it is, he said it's Mercedes-Benz's Mixed Tape. This is a tape that Mercedes-Benz brings out regularly and you can find it [here](http://www.mercedes-benz.de/content/germany/mpc/mpc_germany_website/de/home_mpc/passenger_cars/home/passenger_cars_world/entertainment/mixedtape.html). While looking at that, and downloading the songs I also found the [Mercedes-Benz Podcast](http://www.mercedes-benz.com/content/mbcom/international/international_website/de/com/international_home/home/passion/entertainment/mercedes_benz_podcast.html). Now that is some forward looking thinking by the huge german auto maker. Congratulations. Great free advertising for you. Now just include UMTS chips in your car radios and podcast enable them. Would be great.
