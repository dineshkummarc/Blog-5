That's something I just presume. I myself am the first proof. Sitting at your computer you can have your own Gotuit channel [running](http://www.gotuit.com/player.php?c=Music&amp;p=77635&amp;s=1381554) and I myself am just listening to their top videos. Very nice indeed and hopping over to buy the All American Rejects Album via iTunes was easy. I was not even helped by Gotuit, but it's just easier to buy stuff via your pc when you are sitting at your pc listening to music. Thanks Gotuit.
