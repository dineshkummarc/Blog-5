David [posted](http://hibiya.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=12) about [MagWerk](http://www.magwerk.com/mag.php?magazine=encore&amp;language=en), a magazine specialised in design as it seems. I really like the makeup of presenting the magazine online even though the design is nothing too special. Magazines will work hard at making themselves special through design and a design magazine with good design will not really stick out will it? :) 

There seems to be one (in france?) that gets published in a different format each and every time. Like as a book once, and then as a set of post cards. Very nice indeed. You need to find something special for yourself, and it needs to be what the people want that you want to read your magazine of course.
