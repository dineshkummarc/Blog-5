Ok, not really true as such, but if you check out [Christian Jung's Blog](http://www.cjung.info/wordpress/) where he blogs about his design ideas for [OpenBC](http://openbc.com/), then I'd say that Lars should really get a move on and get him onboard. With the recent design contest that OpenBC is running, a lot of people are submitting more of the same. Christian seems to be thinking about their business model and making the site something that reflects the business model and the way people use the platform. A dream come true for an entrepreneur. But it does seem that [OpenBC already noticed](http://blog.openbc.com/2006/08/openbc_sketches.html).
