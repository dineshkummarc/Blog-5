It has been good to read [Fundsachen](http://blogg.zeit.de/fundsachen/), a blog from [Die Zeit](http://www.zeit.de/). They just linked to the [BFU Bulletin](http://www.bfu-web.de/Bulletin/index.htm) which has lists of all problems on civil aircraft per month. It's fun seeing what kind of problems different airplanes had and how many there are :)
