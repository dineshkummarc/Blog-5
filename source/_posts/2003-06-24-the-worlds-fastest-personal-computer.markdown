Job's did it again. Going just a little bit overboard but creating a great vibe with it.  The Apple Developer Conference started yesterday and the great man himself had his keynote and I am positive he amazed some people. I mean there will be [new Powermacs](http://www.apple.com/powermac/), which will be 64bit and at 3Ghz in 12 months, using a 1Ghz frontside bus, 6.4 GBps memory throughput ... wonderful stuff. Also, the Jaguar is dead and long live [Panther](http://www.apple.com/macosx/panther/) which brings threading to mail (woohoo) and some other cool things that you can read on the page. One thing to note is that you can now switch users easily and when doing that, the desktop rotates on a 3d cube from the old to the new one. Pretty cool ey? A full transcript of the keynote can be found [here](http://www.macrumors.com/wwdc2003.html).
