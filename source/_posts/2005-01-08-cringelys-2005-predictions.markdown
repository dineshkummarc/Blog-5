It's always fun to read Cringley's look back at his last, and introduction of his new predictions of 2005. There is a lot I really agree with. [Cringley's 2005 Predictions](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20050107.html) include things like Apple's rumored $500 PC, which he argues could go out at $250, loosing Apple $100 per box, selling 10 Million for $1 Billion in loss, which is ok with $6 Billion in the bank. Oh, they would be one of the biggest Computer companies out there suddenly :) And Cringley argues, rightfully so, that they could get it back through software, OS upgrades, iTunes sales, etc. And that's just one of his interesting predictions. :)
