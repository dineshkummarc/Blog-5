I am putting all my summaries of my MBA studies online at the [OUBS Blog](http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/), and it's fun and very rewarding. Some things are getting strange though. In the post about &lt;a title=&quot;Analyzing the Industry Environment&quot; href=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/2003/06/analyzing_the_i.html&quot;&gt;Analyzing the Industry Environment I now get people asking me for analysis of some industry. I have questions for the tourism, air line, computer, hotel and now airline industry again. I am starting to wonder if I couldn't make a business out of this ;)
