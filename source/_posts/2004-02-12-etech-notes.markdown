No, I am not at eTech, sadly. It seems to be the perfect place to be for somebody with technolust. But there are lots of summaries and notes to the speeches online, so here are some of them.

* Christian Lindholm from Nokia, as well as many others, posted about a proof-of-concept Series 60 Application that the Nokia CTO mentioned in his Keynote. It's an [easy way to moblog from a series 60 phone](http://www.christianlindholm.com/christianlindholm/2004/02/blogging_via_at.html) and was developed by [Futurice](http://www.futurice.fi/). The guy with the beard in the shot is probably famous by now as you see this picture everywhere. I really like the idea of not having to write an e-mail to post to my moblog but rather take a picture and then choose &quot;moblog&quot; from the menu. It's likely not all that easy but it could be.
* Matt Croydon posted about the [Anytime, Anywhere](http://postneo.com/2004/02/11.html#a3283) keynote, talking about the future of wireless. Interaction between WLAN and 3G/GPRS will be big here. I rememeber that some months (or years even) back, Nokia even said in a presentation that the next 9210/9290 could have WiFi and 3G integrated taking whichever interface works best at any time. Read Matt's post for a short introduction to all the current and future technologies but remember that it's from a US perspective and UMTS/EDGE/W-CDMA are strangly absent even though they will likely be the biggest part of the networks of the future as it's _the_ upgrade path from GSM
* Matt also posted [a summary](http://postneo.com/2004/02/11.html#a3284) of Christian Lindholm's speech. Great stuff about finding a trend and focus groups and building products that work.
* On Loic's blog you can check out [Justin sleeping](http://www.u-blog.net/loic/note/57213), [Howards cool shoes](http://www.u-blog.net/loic/note/57214) and I have the slight feeling that [Loic](http://www.u-blog.net/loic) is distributing Google Juice on a first names basis :)
* Ross Mayfield posted the link to the [O'Reilly Session Notes Wiki Page](http://wiki.oreillynet.com/etech/pub?SessionNotes) which even holds some of the presentations!

There you go. This should be well enough to read!
