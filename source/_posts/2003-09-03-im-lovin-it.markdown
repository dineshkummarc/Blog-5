I just saw the new McDonalds ad here in Germany. Amazing. This week they are starting a campaign WORLD WIDE to bring their new slogan to life. &quot;I'm lovin' it&quot; or &quot;Ich liebe es&quot; in Germany. Now that's an integrated message, something that likely works everywhere. And the ad is actually very good.
