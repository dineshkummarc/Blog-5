news.com has a story on a new plan for WiFi subscription which will simply add $19.99 to your GPRS/T-Mobile bill. You will then have unlimited WiFi usage. Once there is some good coverage, I'd love to see that here too. Then again, for now I can live without high speed internet once I see the sky ;) More: &lt;a title=&quot;T-Mobile bundles Wi-Fi, cellular services | CNET News.com&quot; href=&quot;http://news.com.com/2100-1039-1000501.html&quot;&gt;T-Mobile bundles Wi-Fi, cellular services&lt;/a&gt;
