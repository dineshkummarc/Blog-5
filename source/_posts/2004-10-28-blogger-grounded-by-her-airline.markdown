Check out &lt;I&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Blogger grounded by her airline&quot; href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3955913.stm&quot;&gt;Blogger grounded by her airline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/I&gt; on BBC News. Again a blogger that has been suspended/fired for his or her blog entries. This is getting interesting and I support [Loic's idea](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2004/10/the_bbc_talks_a.html) of a &quot;protect the rights of fired bloggers&quot; site. This is getting stupid. And check out [her blog](http://queenofsky.journalspace.com/) to check somebody in very good spirits.
