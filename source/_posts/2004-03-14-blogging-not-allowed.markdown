Reports are coming in that blogging is more or less not possible at [SXSW](http://www.sxsw.com/). The thing is that they have forbidden cameras as well as the use of power outlets. Check [Corey Doctorow's post](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/14/lets_reform_sxsws_no.html) and [Joi Ito's post about it](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/03/14/sxsw_is_blogger_unfriendly.html). Of course, Robert Scoble already posted something into Joi's comments: [The SXSW Group Moblog](http://sxsw.blogs.com/) - Have a cameraphone? Post to sxsw ( at ) blogs.com. And I do believe that what we are seeing here is the recently announced new Moblogging feature of Typepad, including group moblogging. Very nice indeed. Keep it up people, keep it up!

&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: The rules have been changed. You are now allowed to plug in and take none-commercial photos.

And now everybody speak with me: Blogs will bring power back to the people.
