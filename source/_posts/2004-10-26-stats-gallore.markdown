Getting down the stats bit again. Having worked in the space for some time I love goog stats and I recently got introduced to [Statcounter.com](http://www.statcounter.com/) and they are nice. They give you an invisible counter for free (which saves them bandwidth, and they get most of their money from Banners in the Stats anyway) and just tease you with more features. It's also limited to 9000 hits per day per Project, where one Project is one Site. I can only suggest it for your blog if you can stay within that limit, which should be the case for most people. And if not, just pay a bit of money, as it's not too expensive. You can take a look at the [stats from this blog](http://my.statcounter.com/project/standard/stats.php?project_id=431337&amp;guest=1) as I kept them public. On top of that I now get RSS stats via my [Feedburnder feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/owt) which is also starting to look nice. All in all, a happy camper here with lots more information at my finger tips.
