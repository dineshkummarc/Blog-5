I recently went on and on about how mBoom, which russell posted about will happen. A big idea like that doesn't go unchallenged of course, and [Thijs](http://www.taospace.com/) too me up on it.  He wrote a very nice piece entitled &lt;a title=&quot;Mobile hype&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.taospace.com/2004/05/mobile_hype.html&quot;&gt;Mobile hype&lt;/a&gt; coming in from the customer side. As Russell showed, more and more high tech phones are coming into the market, and this might create something like a boom. I do have to agree with Thijs though, at least to a certain extent because as Thijs points out, I already wrote about the fact that most people don't know what their phones can do at infoSync.  This is a real problem and I will have to think closer about this future when deciding about investing more or less in Nokia and/or Vodafone. The world will become more wireless, and be it only the move from fixed line to wireless communications. The question is whether this will result in more money in the pockets of companies I think about investing in and here Thijs got me thinking again.
