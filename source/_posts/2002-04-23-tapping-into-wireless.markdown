It's published. I recently wrote a review of the book Tapping into Wireless which Dave Mock co-wrote for infoSync. This was followed up with a long talk with Dave about the wireless technology. I am also happy that I am explicitly thanked in the book for the help I gave for a European perspective. Now that my name is in a book already I need it on a book next ;)
