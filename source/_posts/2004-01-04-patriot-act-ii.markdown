As Ross Mayfield has [posted here](http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2004/01/patriot_act_ii.html), the second edition of the Patriot Act has been pushed through without much noise. It was hated and I think it is really weird that the US will let something like this through as the US has always been about your personal freedom, liberty, right to do whatever you want and I have to admit that at least in Florida, you really feel that this is true. It is a free country and I am not sure if they might not be loosing it. But read [Ross' post](http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2004/01/patriot_act_ii.html) with lots of info.
