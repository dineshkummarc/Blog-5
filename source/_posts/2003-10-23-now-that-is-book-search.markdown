Amazon now has a real &lt;a title=&quot;Amazon.com: Books / Search Inside the Book&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/10197021/ref%3Dsib%5Fmerch%5Fgw/102-5747010-6328124&quot;&gt;Book Search which includes searching inside the pages of several thousand book, some 33 million pages. Now this is cool if you are looking for something. Thank you Amazon!
