Great posted by Seth Godin entitled [Blended](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2004/07/blended.html). It talks about the changes that have happened in recent years and I can really agree. Especially because it stroke a cord with me in light of a discussion at a recent 3 day school of the [OUBS](http://oubs.open.ac.uk/), where we had a heated discussion about what the ultimate goal for a company should be. Money? I think these days it is, making more money, but I am not sure if this will be the case in the future. I rather think that it will be a very welcomed side product in your pursuit of a bigger goal. Why do you work at a company for example? Because you give the company a higher ROI? Because you grew the profit center faster than anyone else? No way. You have your own personal motives, and they are very fine grained indeed. Your motives, your goals in life, need to fit the company you work for, because otherwise, you will just do it yourself. Going into business in a knowledge economy, will be made easier and easier by people that make it a service.

I remember a quote from somebody saying something like: &lt;i&gt;Money is like air to people. It's essential to life, but it is not the reason of living.&lt;/I&gt;. Oh how true that is. In the end, all this will likely be very close to the idea of caring about all your stakeholders, which include your customers, partners, investors, community, and much much more. but I am hoping, and believing, that the current focus on the profit bit will become less important, or rather less focussed on, as it does not have as much weight for a company success as the others. This would mean that to really make a profit, your focus needs to be on something else. And that will likely be very good indeed.
