Here I am, off from work, sitting in an internet cafe, surfing. I have to admit though, that I have an excuse. I just met an old friend again who is shortly going online with his laptop and I just needed to try out the powermacs with this HUGE LCD screen they have here. It's wonderful, even though at the moment I have like 60% of my screen space lost because the browser is scaled to full screen. But it's an amazing screen I have to admit. And the Powermac is not really _that_ noisy. Still. This again shows me how wonderful the Mac is to work on and I am truely thinking about an iMac. It would be close to silent and with the cool 17&quot; screen it would rock. the only problem I have now is that I need to decide what kind of route I am taking. I am thinking about a DVD Recorder to replace the old Video Recorder, but if I do, it should be compatible with the desktop PC really. There are still competing standards out there though. Tough questions to think about on a Wednesday evening in Cologne. It was a great day though up till now.
