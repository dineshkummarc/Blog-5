I just registered my [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/) account ([see here](http://www.technorati.com/profile/bizkiffer)). Then I checked my stats and wondered why I had so many hits from Google for the term. Spelling is key here. I got 12 hits already this month as I am third when looking for [technocrati](http://www.google.de/search?q=technocrati&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=de&amp;meta=), watch the extra c ;) There seem to be some other people who are misspelling that. Well now I got it right and I am registered and hopefully it will pick up the [OUBS Blog](http://ennead.de/ou/) soon too.
