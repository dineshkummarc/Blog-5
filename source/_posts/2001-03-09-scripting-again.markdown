Woohooo... good night. I just started with scripting a bit again. This is something I started doing reading the [BeOS Bible](http://www.beosbible.com/) from Scot Hacker and especially the Scripting part from Chris Herborth. Scot did an amazing work with that book and Chris' Scripting part is just amazing I think. Especially if you want to start learning scripting. It is very basic at the start and get's into scripting in BeOS at the end. Very cool stuff.

Actually now I did a backup script on a FreeBSD box and also another one that sends me an e-mail daily about the free space on the hard disk. Not too fancy but really a cool thing if you just did very little scripting up till now and also did not do this for some time.

One of the great learning experiences for me was, among others, trying to alter Scot Hacker's [TrackerBase](http://www.betips.net/TrackerBase/) script which runs [BeTips](http://www.betips.net/).

Enough praising Scot now though :)

I really hate looking at the laptop running Windows as I write this on the desktop in BeOS. Grrr... Somebody code a driver for Lucent's WaveLAN cards for BeOS! :)

Ok, it is after 3am, I might be a bit confused in my head. Especially after I was taken out for dinner today to a Thai restaurant and choose to eat something spicy. I actually like spicy. Really. But boy was this spicy. They had something like 6 different degrees of spicy and my brother told me that 4 would be ok as 3 is really still ok for him. I generally eat more spicy then he does. Ah well. I took 4 and I will not do it again. I mean it was _very_ good, but I am only now starting to regain feeling in my tongue. :)

I really have to go there again. There are so many things I would still like to eat so many things, do so many things, see so many things, feel so many things, ... live is good today.
