The move to a new home is done. The location of my nocat connection at home has been updated &lt;a title=&quot;plazes.beta Plaze:thylmann.net/Germany/50765/Cologne/Am Braunsacker&quot; href=&quot;http://beta.plazes.com/plaze/7413d722a3a2ddba7ce43b983f0414e4/&quot;&gt;in plazes as internet now works, obviously one of the first things to do when you move. :) Thanks to [NetCologne](http://www.netcologne.de/) for taking care of switching my phone line at the right time (and thanks to the Telecom guy for checking the line :))

The view is amazing and while further outside Cologne, its feeling great. We are now living in Esch, which really is still Cologne and I can keep my number plate of the car and the phone number, so all is well. I wouldn't have wanted to really move out of Cologne. Access to the A57 is close, so I am actually sitting between Cologne and D&amp;uuml;sseldorf now, though closer to Cologne. The plazes page includes a link to a Google Map, but I took out the house number, as Google was getting too good at spotting the exact place :)
