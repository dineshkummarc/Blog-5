Next year, I will have the residential school for the OUBS MBA course in Strategic Management at [Milton Hill House](http://www.to-the.com/milton_hill_house/) in Oxfordshire. This thing lookes lovely again I have to say. The venue for the Strategy course was nice, but it was a convention center which means it had no possibility to be as nice as this one. I am really looking forward to being there from 30th of January until February 1st.
