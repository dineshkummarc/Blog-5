Looking for Blog Stats? The BlogSearchengine.com did a survey recently and found out [some interesting things](http://blog.blogsearchengine.com/index.php?p=92).

One has to remember though that it's a survey among hardcore bloggers, as it's done with people who submitted their blog to the search engine. Still.

&lt;I&gt;
* Bloggers are quite active online, 52.8% of all bloggers surveyed update their blogs atleast once a day. 
* While most bloggers do not blog only at work (only 4.8% do), 53% of those bloggers surveyed do blog in the workplace (at work, or at both home and work).
* While most bloggers only own one blog, a large amount, 43.8%, own more than one blog.&lt;/I&gt; (I have the [OUBS Blog](http://ennead.de/ou/) as a repository for my summaries of my management studies for example.)
&lt;I&gt;* Only 13.4% of the bloggers surveyed run advertising in their blogs. Recently a large amount of advertising networks including BlogAds, Googleâ€™s AdSense (no personal blogs), and Skoobie have been open to running ads on smaller web sites and blogs.
* An overwhelming amount of bloggers, 90.7%, have never been contacted by a company or organization with product or service information, asking the blogger to blog about them. This may be because the public relations industry has yet to direct a large amount of its efforts towards bloggers.&lt;/I&gt;

It seems that most use Google's Blogger service. Strangely enough, most stuff that I find uses MovableType like me or has moved over to TypePad.
