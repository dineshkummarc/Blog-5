As I just signed up at [Statcounter.com](http://www.statcounter.com/) I got some interesting stats. One would be from which ISPs the last 100 people came from, which gets especially interesting for the [OUBS Blog](http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/) as the list includes some very nice universities. I might have to think about allowing some ads from people that want to connect to those people.

1. British Library - UK
2. University Of Lincolnshire And Humberside, Sheffield, England, United Kingdom
3. University Of Central England In Birmingham, Reading, England, United Kingdom
4. Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, England, United Kingdom
5. University Of Phoenix, Phoenix, Arizona, United States
6. University Of Abertay Dundee, Dundee, Scotland, United Kingdom
7. University Of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States
8. University Of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States
9. Letterkenny Institute Of Technology, Letterkenny, Donegal, Ireland
10. Liverpool Institute Of Higer Education, Liverpool, England, United Kingdom
11. Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States

Not a bad list really I have to say and I presume some more people who study or have studied surf from home or from places where I didn't know where they came from.
