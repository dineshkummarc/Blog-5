BBC is [reporting](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6248535.stm) about [Koopa](http://koopatheband.com/). Starting this month, you do not need an album in the shops in physical form anymore in the UK. If you have your song as a buyable item in any of the valid online shops, these sales will be counted too and it seems that Koopa is at place 17 of the unofficial UK charts for Monday, poised to break in the top 40 of the official week charts at the end of the week. Unsigned. No record label. Free. If you speak german and want to read a great book about the music industry, check out Tim Renner's &quot;[Kinder, der Tod ist doch nicht so schlimm.](http://www.amazon.de/Kinder-schlimm-Zukunft-Musik-Medienindustrie/dp/3593376369/)&quot; (Kids, death is not that bad).
