Sadly, this is in German, but it's a great study project from 2005, in three parts, explaining the power of money. In short, you need to make people work to control the planet. To make people work, you invent money, because that makes exchanging things very easy. Of course some people have more money, and they give it to you because they are afraid to loose it. You give them a bit more money back in return, like 2% per year. Of course, because there is a law the requires a bank to only hold 2-10% of the money they lend out, you can then lend out 10 times that money for a credit of 10% per year, making you money for nothing. This goes on an on. Very well done. See it [here](http://www.cyberbloc.de/index.php?/site/comments/so_funktioniert_geld/).
