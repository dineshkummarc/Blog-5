I hope you all had a wonderful christmas and enjoyed some time with your loved ones. I for one did and am now back home, with a few more days off. As you might have noticed, I didn't really blog but the things to talk about are plenty. 

I wanted to get back to blogging with a good message and this came to me via a story that is asking [where all the dead animales at Yala National Park are](http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/COL136356.htm). This park in Sri Lanka was washed by the floodwaters up to 3 km deep but there are no dead animals to be found. 

Talk to all of you soon.
