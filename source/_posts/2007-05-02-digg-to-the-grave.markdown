The user generated content market got another lesson today, or rather [Digg](http://digg.com) did. The thing is that somebody posted a story about how to crack the HD DVD algorithm and it obviously got lots of diggs. Digg then got a takedown notice and complied. Soon thereafter there were lots of stories on the front page again about the exact same things. Digg suspended users, deleted comments and posts, ... nothing worked. First [Jay posted](http://blog.digg.com/?p=73) trying to explain that they need to comply to the takedown notice. It only increased the onslaught of posts about the subject.

Now [Kevin posted](http://blog.digg.com/?p=74) and they have given in to the users. The sad thing is, they might loose the company over this, but we'll see. Here are Kevin's (possibly) famous last words:

*But now, after seeing hundreds of stories and reading thousands of comments, youâ€™ve made it clear. Youâ€™d rather see Digg go down fighting than bow down to a bigger company. We hear you, and effective immediately we wonâ€™t delete stories or comments containing the code and will deal with whatever the consequences might be.*

*If we lose, then what the hell, at least we died trying.*

There you see the power of user generated content and it's not an easy thing to grasp. Are you just a conduit, just a platform for people to use? Can you be liable? It's very difficult for all parties involved to understand that playing field and lots of &quot;fun&quot; stuff will probably happen in the next few months.
