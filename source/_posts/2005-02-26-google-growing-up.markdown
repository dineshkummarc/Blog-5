John Heilemann wrote a great piece about Google, covering their history, inner workings, finding VCs and angel investors, growing up and more entitled [Jounrey to the (Revolutionary, Evil-Hating, Cash-Crazy, and possibly Self-Destructive) Center of Google](http://men.style.com/gq/features/full?id=content_422). A truely great read giving you lots of insight why Google is different but not so much as you might believe.
