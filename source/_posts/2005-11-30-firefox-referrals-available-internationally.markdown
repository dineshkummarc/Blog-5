The AdSense Blogs [reports](http://adsense.blogspot.com/2005/11/firefox-referrals-now-available.html) that you can now send Firefox referrals their way and get $1 even if you are not in the US and have an international account/site. I still use Safari I have to admit and I haven't found out why I really need to switch yet, but Google seems to really be pushing their Toolbar with full force and that Firefox is part of the mix cannot be a coincidence. Some people already [wondered](http://google.blognewschannel.com/index.php/archives/2005/11/04/when-did-google-buy-firefox/) whether Google has bought Firefox, with lots of Firefox developers now working at Google and if you believe the [GoogleOS](http://www.kottke.org/05/08/googleos-webos) myths to be true, then having a good foot in the door in terms of future browser development and strategy is a good thing.

And as I [posted some time ago](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/09/still_time_to_i.html), and now with [Google's Shipping Container](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/11/googles_shippin.html), having the Toolbar everywhere would be a really good way to track everything and slowly but surely build their own Internet Backbone, knowing what users browse, search, read, and what their navigational paths across the web are. And as Seth [has posted on Transparent Bundles](http://majestic.typepad.com/seth/2005/11/media_futures_t.html), Clickstreams are gold to be mined.

So now go make me some money :)
