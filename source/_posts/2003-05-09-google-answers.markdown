Now that's nice. When I came home tonight I had a package at the door step. Now who is sending me something? You guessed (I can of gave it away with the subject didn't I? ;)) Google. I've been a Google Researcher for some time now but I have to admit that I didn't do too much. The Researchers they have are just too good and fast, but I will have to look into it again now. They sent me a present, a very nice warm blanket with the Google Logo. Very nice indeed, especially because they sent it across half the planet.

In case you are wondering, Google Researchers are those that answer your questions at Google Answers, a service that lets you ask questions for a small fee. You decide how much you pay, Researchers decide if they want to answer. Very nice service indeed.
