I already knew about [dabbledb](http://dabbledb.com/) and it's an interesting concept but a little hard to get an idea of what is possible with the application. Now they have a demo out there called [Digg into Dabble](http://dabbledb.com/explore/screencasts/digg/) and it's amazing. It really shows the ease and power of the system. I really have to look closer into this.
