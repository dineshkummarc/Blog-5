The german computer magazing [C'T](http://www.heise.de/ct/) has an interesting [joke](http://www.heise.de/ct/schlagseite/03/04/) in their newest magazine. Translated, the image, picturing a detective, reads: &quot;This is the work of professionals. They only took the gold, securities and printer cartridges.&quot; Oh so true.
