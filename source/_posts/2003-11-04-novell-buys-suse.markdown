The Operating System Wars are hotting up again. Can Novell come back with their buy of SuSe? Here is [a story on Heise (German)](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/odi-04.11.03-000/) about it and [here on News.com](http://rss.com.com/2100-7344_3-5101680.html) and [here on The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/33770.html). Would be fun seeing Novell come back bigtime ;) But $210 Million made some people a bundle today. Good for German entrepreneurs.
