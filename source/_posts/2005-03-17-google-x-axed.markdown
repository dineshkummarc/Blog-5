News.com isreporting that &lt;a title=&quot;Google's X files vanish&quot; href=&quot;http://news.com.com/Googles X files vanish/2100-1032_3-5621247.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5621247&amp;subj=news&quot;&gt;Google's X files vanish&lt;/a&gt;ed. That was really a tribute to MacOS X and the mac in general so it might have been removed just because it might have upset some other people. I just hope they don't fire the guy that Chikai Ohazama, who seems to have developed this, doesn't get fired over it. :) At least [his post about Google X](http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/03/google-goes-x.html) is still up on the Google Blog.
