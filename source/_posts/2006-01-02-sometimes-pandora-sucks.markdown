&lt;p&gt;There you have it, I said it. As of today I am a huge fan of [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/). In general, the service simply rocks. Just fitting music. I believe their licensing works in a way that is similar to radio, in that they pay cheaper licensing fees because I can't really choose what to listen to. I can't choose the next song. This is reinforced by the fact that if you skip too many songs, you will get a message that due to licensing issues they can't allow you to skip too many songs. Now ... emmm... the current song is _not_ something I want to be hearing. The guy that wrote it is probably getting money for me listening! AND I CAN'T SKIP ANYMORE! Ok, I need to learn to only skip in extrem cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, a great service and ... the next one is turning out to be all right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Update&lt;/B&gt;: I seem to be roughly correct in my licensing guess. Tom from Pandora commented.&lt;/p&gt;
