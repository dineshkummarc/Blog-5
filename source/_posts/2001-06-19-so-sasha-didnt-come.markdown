Well. Aachen is the center of the music world (in Aachen :)) these days. Today the german singer Sasha should have been coming but he has a cough. Blah! Not that anyone in our house here really loves any of the artists comeing with all their heart, it is still fun to have these open air gigs right behind our house. 

Sadly we cannot see the stage but only hear it.

Tomorrow we will have BAP, another german band and only if they do not get a cold too :) We will probably barbeque on the roof to listen.

Thursday will be nice with Vonda Shepard, which is nice even though I already saw her in Cologne a short time ago. But this is one of the groups that will interest me the most.

Friday will be Scorpions. :) Boy this will be a blast and probably a lot of fun people to look at wondering around :)

The interesting thing is that Saturday is some weird band that I have no clue about. Hmmm... I will report back to the world and to keep my thoughts here.

The cool thing is that we have a beer tent in front of our window too :)

Oh, and I tried out skyscraper ads on Counted! today. Actually looks ok but sadly Flycast, emm.. Engage, does not have paying ads for those yet. Bummer. Would be nice. Other than that I will put Tribal Fusion on Counted! too, like I did with BeNews.
