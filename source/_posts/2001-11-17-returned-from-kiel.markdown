Just spent the last few days in Kiel with my gf, her mother and her brother. It was a real fun few days I have to say and they passed way too fast. Her brother just returned from the Maledives (hope I spelled that correctly) where we was a tour guide for 8 months. Nice job. Get up, great some people, rest on the beach all day, maybe go out with the boat with a few people with dolphins swimming next to you, some more work in the evening and you are done. Of course that is after mastering the task a bit and not trying to solve everything at once. But the tails he has are amazing. He was diving once and on his second trip the diving instructor pointed up and there was a 4 meter wide fish above him. Sting ray? Not exactly, something like that, you know the flat ones that sometimes rest on the floor covered by sand, but not that one but the other one, there seem to be two kinds of them. But anyway, he said he wasn't shure at this time if he should be amazed or scared ;)

Nokia Game is going well but I somehow have missed some points it seems. Grrr... It's still interesting to follow what is going on there and it should be another week until we are done. I don't really want at Nokia 5510, which is the price for the top 50 people, anyway. There are some amazing Nokia phones coming out it seems, to be announced tomorrow in Barcelona. Once color screen one which looks cool.

Next weekend I will have my Management Challenge with the Open University. In Windsor near London. I should have been flying over from Brussels but now with Sabena bancrupt there were some problems with the way back. Now I switched to Lufthansa from Duesseldorf which are better times anyway. I should be meeting one or two of the people in my Tutor group at Heathrow airport and we will get a cab together. The place I am going to is some kind of old building form 1850 or something with 15 acres of land, swimming pool and everything. 100 students and 10 tutors will be there to go over last years subjects with us. As far as I have been told from other people it is a lot of fun, with almost no sleep. Ah well.

I also found out that one of the people from my old school is working at a security company now. He was one of the left wing kind of people, going to demonstrations, organizing them, being very scared of being listened to by the government in his appartment. Then he started getting into computers and started doing linux stuff, started doing encryption and now he is working at some security company that audits company networks. Doing speeches at conventions, running courses, auditing networks. It totally fits. Brought a smile on my face when he heard how well he is doing there.

Somebody else who really never seemed like somebody who wanted to study or work hard or somethig, heavy metal fan, drinking a lot, not doing anything ... well now he has worked inside Nato with top security clearance and is doing is doctor in politics ;) 

There are some very interesting people in my class I have to say. Another one is finishing has law degree now, then he wants to become an airline pilot ;)

A fun, have to go to the city now get a gift for a friend who is teaching martial arts here in cologne. It was his birthday yesterday. We are going out for thai food.
