This labs thing is starting to become a common thing to do and now [Heiko pointed me](http://www.hebig.com/archives/003582.shtml) to [Reuters Labs](http://labs.reuters.com/), which have some interesting little apps for you to try out. There is for example an Apple Widget to get quotes and news, or podcasts, or a system to integrate a video feed from them on your site. Building your news site gets easier and easier.
