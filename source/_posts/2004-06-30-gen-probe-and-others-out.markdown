So I needed some quick kills, just to get the number of potential investments down to a minimum. I started from the bottom. With Level 3 already out, Gen Probe was next, but after looking arround a bit on Yahoo! Finance I cancelled that idea too. For one, [Insider Transactions for Gen Probe](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=GPRO) were mostly sales and especially the CEO seems to be selling. Institutions hold [90% of the float](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=GPRO), meaning that an investment can't get an upkick from institutions suddenly finding the stock. Without a dividend, which they don't pay, stock price movements would be the only thing to bank on and based on Analyst estimates the growth won't be too amazing. Adding to that, that I don't really know their business, I move on.

Infosys Technologies, the IT outsourcing people, have declining revenue and on top of that, their money is on allowing others to pay less for more. They do better if they can pay people less. Just not something I want to be in.

Monsanto seems to have little growth in them from the analyst estimates, already high institutional investors and negative cash flow. And I don't fully understand their business. So that one is out too.

That leaves: Genentech, eBay, Vodafone, Flextronics and Interactivecorp. Interactivecorp likely is too puzzeling. I held off with Flextronics for a long time but might have to stop doing that. They just have amazing lock in once they build all this stuff for you. I already do have Vodafone shares and I still do believe in the wireless future. eBay might have a too high P/E for my liking and Genentech looks very promising. We will see.
