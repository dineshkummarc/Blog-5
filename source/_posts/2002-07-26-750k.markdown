Well, The Register seems to have gotten info on the number of Nokia 7650s that are coming out of the factories each month now that they reached full production. Just as a relation, Palm managed to sell 300.000 palms per month last quarter. 

There are now 750000 Nokia 7650s coming out of the factories!!! And they didn't even launch the US version yet!

So much for volume. If this continues then Symbian will simply blow the roof of any other PDA sales.
