&lt;p&gt;Recently I posted the [question who Gasoil Inc is](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/who_the_hell_is.html) and I have been thinking a bit from time to time, and thought I'd share some ideas. It seems that entrepreneurs, companies, you name it, do that sometimes. Instead of founding a new business from scratch, they just buy a hollow shell of a business, that in this case was already listed some time, and hence save a bit of working getting the legal side up and running. Of course there is the problem of not knowing if there has been some prior business where people will complain and want some money, but if you can rule that out, you save both time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case I would presume that Gasoil Inc will be renamed in some time into something like Google Investment Inc, or Google Agency Services, doing something different then Google but still being run by the people behind it. It would probably not have Google in its name though because Google itself does not seem to be affiliated with the company. I could imagine that those inside have given some of their shares to the company which might mean that it does not have to be filed with the SEC filing of Google itself. Not sure though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Gasoil Inc will also hold securely the data that Google Scans from Libraries so that people do not wonder if Google is now a content holder. There are surely some other ideas I'd love to hear about and I am still looking for answers. Ok, mailing Google's investors service might be an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe they're the new Google Company that builds up [a dark fiber network](http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?site=lightreading&amp;doc_id=65454) . :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; [What Gasoil Inc is](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/02/what_gasoil_inc.html) ... the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
