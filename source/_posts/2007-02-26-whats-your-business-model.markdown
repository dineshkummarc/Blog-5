Great video that Bob Stumpel posted on his Web 2.0 blog. You can view it [here](http://bobstumpel.blogspot.com/2007/02/business-20.html). It's a panel moderated by [Guy Kawasaki](http://www.guykawasaki.com/) with lots of different entrepreneurs talking about how they started, what their business models were and are now, what the good and bad sides of founding a business are and why you just have to work yourself through the ups and downs.

Great stuff to listen too and a good mix of sites that partly didn't or still don't have a real business model.
