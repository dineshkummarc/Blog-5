I stayed almost two hours in the biggest book store in NRW, a part of germany, yesterday. I thought I'd boil down my amazon wish list a bit and in the end bought two books of it, added two new ones and bought another two that were not even in the list.

In total I bought the Dilbert Principle by Scott Adams, Neal Stephensons new book Interface (at least I think it's new), The New new thing by Michael Lewis and The Nebula Awards Showcase 2002, a list of short stories that won the award in 2002. In 1985 Orson Scott Card won the Nebula Award as Best Novel for Ender's Game, just to make a point that these might actually be very very good. Of course, I rarely like films that win lots of awards, but we will see.

I added No Logo by Naomi Klein, Strategy Safar by Henry Mintzberg and The Corrrections by Jonathan Franzen.
