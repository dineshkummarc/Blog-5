I had some talks with friends again recently and some things came up that even though simple, are worth really thinking about.

First of all, this is really not a normal war. We have to be very clear about that. Most other wars have been about land and this is about belief, nothing else. And the most dangerous thing is that at least one side of this war has no problem whatsoever of dying for their cause. They believe in their cause. With all their heart and mind. They will not stop until their last heart beat. This is not to say that everybody needs to be killed but just that this does not have a clear line of where it is over. You can't say: &quot;Well, they are out of Kuweit now and we just have to pay attention that they don't get in again.&quot; They are spread all over the world with the belief that until their goal is reached they will die for achieving it. Very very very scary.

The second thing is that if this will result in a war, a real war, then this will most likely be a war in Europe. They are spread all over the world but Europe is just the closest. Think about that.
