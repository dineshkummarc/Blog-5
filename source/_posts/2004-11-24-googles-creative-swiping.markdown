A few days ago Google opened [Froogle Germany](http://froogle.de/) which is a nice thing but I didn't think it was worth blogging. But now [Froogle](http://www.froogle.com/) got back into my search lights due to [this Google Blog post](http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/11/im-wishing.html). In it Jason Shellen announces something that was creatively swiped from Amazon, something I have been using there for ages. A wish list. Yes, at least in the US version, not yet in the German one, you can now add everything you find to your wish list. [here](http://froogle.google.com/shoppinglist/shoppinglist?action=ShowWishList&amp;email=mysecretsanta@gmail.com) is an example list. Perfect timing and I now want it in German too please!
