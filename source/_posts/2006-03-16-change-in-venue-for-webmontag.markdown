We need to change the venue for WebMontag and I am mighty pissed. I am currently looking for an alternative and might know more tomorrow. We are looking at Halmackenreuther again. The thing is that the big Cleanicum head honcho seems to have a friend that wants to do an event there and hence we are thrown out. The person I talked to, who heads the Cleanicum here in Cologne, doesn't even really have a say in that. Amazing. I am still baffled by how somebody can behave like this. Like with the other events we didn't have anything in writing, as we didn't pay anything either, but we would have paid something if needed which was even communicated. Baffled. Still confused. I will update the Wiki once I know more.
