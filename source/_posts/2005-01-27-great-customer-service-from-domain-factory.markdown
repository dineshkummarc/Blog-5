Mena started it all with her post about [Great Customer Service from Lufthansa](http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2005/01/great_customer.shtml), asking to post your own experiences. The one I thought about sharing some time ago already was in regard to a domain move to [Domain Factory](http://www.domain-factory.de/). Due to the fact that they give you full control of the DNS entries, I decided to move some domains to them from another domain registrar. The entire process happened very smoothly indeed and they answered every question swiftly and correctly. Even on a sunday, I had a password problem with a new domain registration but was able to get the correct answer to my question via eMail within minutes. So much for my little story for today.
