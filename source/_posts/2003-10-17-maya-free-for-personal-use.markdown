Sadly, there is one excuss less available now to not play with [Maya](http://www.alias.com/eng/products-services/maya/maya_ple/index.shtml). There is no excuss now anymore that you don't have the $7999 that the unlimited version of the 3D animation software costs. It is [now free for personal use](http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20031015005537&amp;newsLang=en). Now all I need is some talent ;)
