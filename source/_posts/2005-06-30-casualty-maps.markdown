Today Google announced their API to Google Maps, and Yahoo! did for their maps too by the way. Lifehacker is already [reporting](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/search-engines/google-maps-iraq-war-casualties-110736.php) about [Casualty Maps](http://www.casualty-maps.com/), which shows where the people from the US lived that died in the war on Iraq. Powerful.
