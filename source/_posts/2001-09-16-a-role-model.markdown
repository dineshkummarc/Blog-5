&lt;I&gt;With sadness, I watch and listen as mothers and fathers hold the terrorists up as role models for their children.

I spoke with four children under the age of 10 yesterday. Three of the children told me that they were going to find the bad guys and kill them...I do believe that our country has just been the victim of children who felt the same way.

The fourth little guy is the one that gave me hope. As he sat in front of the television, watching the continuous reporting of death and destruction and suffering, he spoke the wisest words I had heard all day.

As Austin watched, he said very quietly and to no one in particular, &quot;I think those guys are dumb.&quot;

If little Osama's parents and religious teachers had taught him more about dumb and less about anger and violence, Tuesday would have been just another sunny day in New York.
&lt;/I&gt;
