Wonderful. Yesterday I tried out connecting to my [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/) subscriptions page (you can get my OPML file [here](http://www.bloglines.com/public/biz)) with my Nokia 6600 and I have to say, thanks to [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), it worked pretty well. But now I just read on Mark Fletcher's blog that [Bloglines now has a mobile version](http://www.wingedpig.com/archives/000117.html) at [bloglines.com/mobile/](http://www.bloglines.com/mobile/). That page kind of gives me directly what Opera would otherwise reformat, which is very nice and less resource intensive. So there we have it. A nice option for that would be to set it so that it only displays excerpts, because I read many blogs or sites that syndicate their entire feed and I might not want to get that one my phone. So an excerpt plus a save and more button would be great! Still, already a step in the right direction.
