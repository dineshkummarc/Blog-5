&lt;p&gt;This article by Gary Hamel and C.K. Prahalad focusses on competitiveness itself. They say we are at a stage were we can diagnose a problem once it is there but we can't keep people from getting sick... or rather companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They argue that: &quot;Long-term competitiveness depends on managers' willingness to challenge continually their managerial frames.&quot; On top of that they believe that a company that is doing badly didn't have too much resources it didn't get buyers for, but rather it didn't have high enough ambitions. They say that &quot;Creating stretch, a misfit between resources and aspirations, is the single most important task senior management faces.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example they say that there were times when CNN was providing 24 hour news coverage with one fifth of the budget of CBS turning out only 1 hour of news in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best point they made, in my mind, was this:
Downsizing is reducing the buck paid for the bang.
Resource leveraging is getting a bigger bang for the buck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they go on explaining what management can do, in terms of broad overviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convergence and Focus is about some key goal. I quote: &quot;When Komantsu (who were trying to overtake Caterpillar) initiated its total quality control programme, every manager was given explicit instructions to vote quality in a choice between costs and quality.&quot; If you have few resources, set them to achieve one specific task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracting and borrowing is about drawing from a companies pool of experiences. You can have a million but what you need to do is use every one of them. On top of that a company can use its core competence and try to entice other companies to use that instead of building their own expertiese. You can then also borrow from their expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blending and balancing is about finding ways to blend different resources in the idea of 1 + 1 &gt; 2. The company also needs to balance product development, production and distribution. All three legs need to be there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recycling, co-opting and shielding is about:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never forgetting some resource as it might come in handy later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making others see the importance of your success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;building up force out of sight of major competition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
