The PSP stands for Playstation Portable. It's what Sony announced yesterday or rather has shown a prototype off. It will go into competition with the Gameboy Advanced and the Nokia N-Gage, if you can call the N-Gage competition already, which is actually very flattering ;) More information and links to several stories can be found [on Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/009952.php).
