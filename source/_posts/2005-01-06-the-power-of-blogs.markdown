This is really getting fun. I posted about the [PR Gau at Jamba](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/12/the_great_jamba.html) some time ago and now one of the biggest magazines in germany wrote about it:&lt;a title=&quot;PR-Problem fuer Klingeltonhaendler: Blogger heizen Jamba ein - Netzwelt - SPIEGEL ONLINE&quot; href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzkultur/0,1518,335622,00.html&quot;&gt;PR-Problem fuer Klingeltonhaendler: Blogger heizen Jamba ein - Netzwelt - SPIEGEL ONLINE. Now [the original Spreeblick post](http://spreeblick.de/wp/index.php?p=324) gets tons and tons of traffic, going as far as giving the server some troubles. Now do you understand that Bloggers can become a PR Problem? Oh, they can also be a huge opportunity. :)
