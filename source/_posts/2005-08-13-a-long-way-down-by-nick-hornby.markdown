A group of 4 people meet on the roof of a house in london on new years eve wanting to kill themselves. They re-shedule to valentines day together. A really wonderful book to read and with Hornby having written the book for About A Boy among others, you can expect something funny and insightful. I can really recommend the book for some light reading: [Check it out!](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1573223026/)
