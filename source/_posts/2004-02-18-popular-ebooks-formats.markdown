Which are they? It seems that Cory Doctorow wanted to find out and when publishing his newest book he was asking readers who translated it into a format not yet on the web site, to send him this version and he put it online. You download [Eastern Standard Tribe](http://craphound.com/est/download.php) in currently 22 Formats :). In general, the [site about the book](http://www.craphound.com/est/) is run with MovableType and the entire book is published under the Creative Commons License. I do have a great respect for Cory I have to say, for trying to find out where the future is going both in his books and arround it. He is following his own path and seems to be doing so both with pleasure and success.   (Thanks to [Fred's Log](http://www.com-soft.de/mt/archives/000088.html))
