LOL. Just read this one on a message board:

&lt;I&gt;As the coals from our barbecue burned down, our hosts passed out marshmallows and long roasting forks.  Just then, two fire trucks roared by, sirens blaring, lights flashing. They stopped at a house right down the block. All twelve of us raced out of the back yard, down the street, where we found the owners of the blazing house standing by helplessly. They glared at us with looks of disgust.

Suddenly, we realized that we were all still holding our roasting forks with marshmallows on them... &lt;/I&gt;
