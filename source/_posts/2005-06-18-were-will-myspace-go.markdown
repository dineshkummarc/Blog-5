Nice article about [MySpace.com](http://myspace.com/) on AlwaysOn. &lt;a title=&quot;Will MySpace.com keep its lead?   :: AO&quot; href=&quot;http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P10796_0_6_0_C&quot;&gt;Will MySpace.com keep its lead?. Just check out the [Alexa Chart](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=2y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=p&amp;url=http://myspace.com#top) to see their growth rate. Based on Alexa they are now 29th biggest site on the net. Scary indeed. The article gives some details about why they have grown so well  and includes some good ideas.
