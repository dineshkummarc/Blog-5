This was mailed to me and I have to admit that it makes you think...

&lt;I&gt;Question 1:
If you knew a woman who was pregnant, who had 8 kids already, three who were
deaf, two who were blind, one mentally retarded, and she had syphilis, would
you recommend that she have an abortion?

 Read the next question before looking at the answer for this one.

Question 2:
 It is time to elect a new world leader, and only your vote counts.

Here are the facts about the three leading candidates.

Candidate A - Associates with crooked politicians, and consults with
astrologists. He's had two Mistresses. He also chain smokes and drinks 8 to
10 martinis a day.

Candidate B - He was kicked out of office twice, sleeps until noon, used
opium in college and drinks a quart of whiskey every evening.

Candidate C - He is a decorated war hero. He's a vegetarian, doesn't smoke,
drinks an occasional beer and never cheated on his wife.

Which of these candidates would be your choice

Decide first, no peeking, then scroll down for the answer.
&lt;/I&gt;

The answer follows...


&lt;!-- more --&gt;


... So here are the candidates.

&lt;I&gt;Candidate A is Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Candidate B is Winston Churchill.

Candidate C is Adolph Hitler.

And, by the way, the answer to the abortion question:
If you said yes, you just killed Beethoven. Pretty interesting isn't it? Makes a person think before judging someone.&lt;/i&gt;
