[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) (which is growing on me) has a new tool called [the Organizr](http://www.flickr.com/tools/organizr.gne) and while it is a very nice tool the coolest thing can be found at the bottom of the above page: 

&lt;I&gt;4. Flickr API. Organizr is built on the Flickr API, which we are opening up to developers. Think you can make a better version? [Click here for more info..](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/)&lt;/i&gt;

People, I am starting to drool!
