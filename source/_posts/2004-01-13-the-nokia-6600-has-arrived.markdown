It's here. The Nokia 6600 has finally arrived and I am happy to say that I love it. Syncing via iSync and the iBook worked without a problem after copying the 3650 configuration files and changing the settings from 3650 to 6600. I presume it will work out of the box with the next update, especially as the 6600 seems to be selling very well indeed. So now I have all my contacts (including images!!!) on the phone, I have MMS and GPRS set and already sent out an image via eMail. More playing with the phone will be going on this evening and I will be trying to sum up some of my findings and give some pointers to cool applications out there for Series 60 and Symbian 7.0! Stay tuned!
