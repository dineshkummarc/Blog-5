With YouTube getting bought up by Google, which I won't even link to as you all read about it already, the video space is really hotting up and I do expect that the German space will hot up too, as JÃ¼rgen Habichler notes [here](http://habichler.wordpress.com/2006/10/10/google-buys-youtube-for-stunning-165bn/).

When looking at the different platforms out there, I will actually have to say that I think [Sevenload](http://sevenload.de) will soon get a good amount of money. Their interface is great, they are [growing well](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=1y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=p&amp;url=http://sevenload.de#top) (remember alexa is just an indicator) and the site is still responsive. If they have their system internationalized already, then some of the big VCs might be really interested. The other thing is though that if there was a candidate for an IPO it was YouTube and what will the next guy do. There wasn't huge competition around the buyout from Google it seems, meaning that there aren't too many buyers out there that want to spend oodles of cash. And once you have a VC in, it's pretty likely that you will either have to see or IPO, that's just the way the business goes.

Let's see how this one turns out.
