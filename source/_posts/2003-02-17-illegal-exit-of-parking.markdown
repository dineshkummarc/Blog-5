There you have it, I did something that might be called illegal. Today, I went to see [a movie](http://www.72qmddr.de). The film was ok, nothing more, nothing less. Partly due to the fact that I thought it was a comedy and it wasn't (bad commercials I'd say, or good ones depending on your view point ;)). After the movie, I got into the car and wanted to get out of the parking lot. Easier said than done because there were huge lines of cars. I would say that there were at least 40 to 60 cars standing arround virtually doing nothing, in line, waiting to get out. Something was wrong with the barrier. Strangely enough, nobody was coming down though to get it to open and everybody who by now would be arriving at the upper barrier, which was the only one open and probably far over 20 cars away for almost everyone in sight, would have a ticket that no longer works as you need to get out within 20 minutes if I am not mistaken. I waited for sometihng to happen for like 5 minutes in which I started to wonder if it is really the best thing to have that many motors running in a closed space. Anyway ...

I then got out of the car and soon we were something like 6 to 8 people (the rest seemingly wanted to wait forever) at the barriers wondering what to do. I started talking with somebody about how the barriers work and then we got an idea. A car, from outside, arrived, we gieded him to the entry barrier, he got a ticket, the barrier opened, he drove away, and we took turns holding up the barrier. The cars, who all had paid their tickets started getting out. Several people took turns holding open the barrier and when I arrived something like a minute or two later with my car, it was down. Do not dispair though, somebody else had taken the tough decision and simply broken open the exit barrier, which was now standing wide open. 

All in all, I am not even sure if what we did was illegal. I mean, we all (well at least most by far) paid their ticket. I for one, didn't destroy anything. It's even likely that the exit barrier that was standing up now isn't broken either. It was an interesting experience though. How long would people have waited. What would they have done. Why would they have done nothing? Would it have become a problem with the air? How long would it have taken? Interesting to say the least. Bed time now. The day ended with a smile. :)
