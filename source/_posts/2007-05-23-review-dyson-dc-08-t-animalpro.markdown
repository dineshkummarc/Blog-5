or how to really suck! I was weary I have to say. Buying a vacuum cleaner is really nothing that should cost a lot of money and you can probably get one for well under 100 EURs. But somehow there is this company called [Dyson](http://dyson.com) that makes vacuum cleaners that are just cool. I actually had one case study about Dyson during the MBA course and it really took some time for the founder to convince people that this was a good idea. I mean look at how ugly their [hand vacuum](http://www.dyson.com/range/feature_frame.asp?model=DC16-SY-STD&amp;sinavtype=pagelink) is!

I for one was just in the market for a new vacuum cleaner and being a geek, all this centrifuge and other mambo jumbo obviously appealed to me. Having cats added to the fact that I really needed to take a look at Dyson and I now wound up buying the Dyson DC 08 T Animalpro (links at the end). This has a special system against cat hair and a filter against allergies. The standard price here in Germany is 519 EURs! What the F***! That is probably your first reaction. I can buy a MacMini for that the second one. :)

I actually got it 330 EURs from Amazon. Still a lot but not 519. And then it arrived, as always ugly as hell, amazing color, and home it went. The weekend was the time of trying it out and oh the wonder. This thing does put cleaning on a different level, the air even smells differently afterwards. The only scary thing is that you are wondering if you lived in a pigs place because of the amount of dirt it picks up even if you used your old vacuum cleaner before. It's also not too heavy at 8 kg and comes with lots of fine extras for cleaning your car and stuff.

All in all I do not regret it one bit. It's expensive but it is worth it. And that you have to empty the dust by hand is something that you will get used to and it is actually well solved to be easy.

Now to try to see if there is any meaningful amount of money to be made from affiliate product links, I hereby present you the direct links to my Amazon aStores. And yes, this is a real review, I am not making this up and I really think the product is good.
