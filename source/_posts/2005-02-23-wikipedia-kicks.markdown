&lt;p&gt;We just had a discussion at work why Blink 182 is named Blink 182 (it seems the number is random and was added due to another band being named Blink). So we searched Google, found the [Wikipedia page about Blink 182](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_182) and you know what? Today is the 23rd. The Wikipedia page already includes the fact (I haven't confirmed and didn't know) that the Band split up on the 22nd!!! Good god! Now bad, Wikipedia's updating speed I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
