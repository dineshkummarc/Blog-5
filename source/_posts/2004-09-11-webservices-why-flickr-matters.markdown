Jeremy Zawodny has a great piece entitled &lt;I&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/002526.html&quot;&gt;Next Generation Web Services: Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/I&gt; which gives a good bit of detail on why Flickr really really kicks. They are embracing with full force what is currently happening in the web world, putting APIs out to interact with the service, enabling it to become a platform in the end. this is what [Web 2.0](http://www.web2con.com/) is all about, the new network out there that isn't only hosted content anymore but full interactivity.
