Great article by Seth Godin entitled [&lt;i&gt;Time to take action?&lt;/i&gt;](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2004/08/time_to_take_ac.html):

&lt;i&gt;So stop thinking about how crazy the times are, and start thinking about what the crazy times demand. There has never been a worse time for business as usual. Business as usual is sure to fail, sure to disappoint, sure to numb our dreams. That's why there has never been a better time for the new. Your competitors are too afraid to spend money on new productivity tools. Your bankers have no idea where they can safely invest. Your potential employees are desperately looking for something exciting, something they feel passionate about, something they can genuinely engage in and engage with.&lt;/I&gt;

Especially the last part about employees is sticking in my head more and more which you read several times if you read this blog.
