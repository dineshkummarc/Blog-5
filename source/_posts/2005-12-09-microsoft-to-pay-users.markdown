Now this is an interesting twist. [John links](http://battellemedia.com/archives/002099.php) to [a story](http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/12/08/HNmssearchengine_1.html) in which Bill Gates is quoted as saying that Microsoft will look at giving back some of the revenues generated through its search engine to users. We had, in the previous bubble, the model to get paid to look at ads, and it failed. This is different though. Microsoft will pay for traffic of good intent as John put it. It pays people to ask their questions, which is an interesting model to say the least and it might be that one thing that makes Microsoft get a kick start. Of course it remains to be seen what they really do, but Gates brought up a whole new thing now, and shows again that they can put their war chest towards gaining market share if they want to.
