When I [first heard](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/11/skypein_germany.html) about the 25 EUR Base UMTS Internet Flatrate I was thrilled. Then I really complained because you needed a second SIM card to use it. Ever heard of Bluetooth and UMTS phones? I went as far as complaining to both the support line as well as their press people. In the end, one of their press representatives called, I threatened with the blog of course ;), and explained their view to me, which revolved around the fact that billing it on one card would be harder and that they really saw it as a replacement for internet at the home.

I was however reassured that they would be looking into it and only 3 months later I see a change. If you look at [this page](http://www.base.de/101_internetflatrate.jsp) on base.de, you will see that the footnote changed, if you speak german. There is now the option to either have this on your normal SIM card or on a second one. Rock on! This is affordable always online! This is where the mobile internet has to move. Add stuff like [Mabber](http://mabber.de/), Moblogging via [Flickr](http://flickr.com/), SyncML, Bluetooth and lots of train travel and you are having something that the mobile internet can really be used to. Yeah, I am a big supporter of [FON](http://fon.com/), but that is not, and will not be, available everywhere. This will. My second phone from T-Mobile still has two months to go on its included bandwidth plan but I am pretty sure to enable this base thing pretty soon. Thanks Base!

P.S.: VoIP is excluded, but you have to give them something ;)
