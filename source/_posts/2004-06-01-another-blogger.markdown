I had a wonderful family weekend in Belgium, including a great dinner on saturday at [Barbizon](http://www.barbizon.be/). The food was delicious, even though my lamb could have had a bit more taste to it really, it was a bit too fine in taste for me, or rather for my gums ;). The entree and desert were amazing though. And while with family over the weekend, I also managed to get my brother blogging. Welcome: &lt;a title=&quot;The Adult Web&quot; href=&quot;http://ft.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;The Adult Web&lt;/a&gt;. This will be an interesting one to watch, both due to the fact that he is a very good coder, and I mean very, and that he is working in a very competitive industry that knows volume: porn! Go check it out.
