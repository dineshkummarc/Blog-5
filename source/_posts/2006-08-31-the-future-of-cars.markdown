This is what I would call [this article](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/08/the_hybrid_mini.php). It's about a company that has refitted a BMW Mini resulting in the following (in short):

	* Maximum Range of 1500km
	* Top Speed of 150mph
	* 0-60mph in 4.5 seconds
	* 4 160 horsepower electric motors, one in each wheel ;)

Just read the article and check out there site [here](http://www.pmlflightlink.com/) for more information. The wheels have full time ABS by the way, be it accelerating or braking, which the motors do all the time, recharging the batteries when braking. :)

If you sell the car like this, please tell me. :)
