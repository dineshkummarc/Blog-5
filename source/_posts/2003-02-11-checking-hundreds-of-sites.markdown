I currently have to check several hundred sites to see if they are still part of an affiliate network. Somebody has to do it and I actually only check part of the total amount. The cool part is that you get to see a lot of funny, bad, interesting, worse, ... sites. Many of them are not even working anymore, other's are simply 3 page sites of somebody with their first web design trials. Some others still exist ... or rather their domains do, being redirected to [porn](http://www.surf-easy.net) sites. Take a look at different steps in [building a house](http://www.sachsen-immobilien24.de/), or check out a [really confusing personal portal](http://home.t-online.de/home/rings/) and enjoy tens of different [page not found](http://www.yourwebportal.de) entries. There are also some [good](http://www.ketchum.de/) looking sites and interestingly enough I was redirected to two corporate intranets, sadly with login required.
