[Phillip M. Torrone](http://www.flashenabled.com/) has now put up all the pictures from his experiment on his [art site](http://www.philliptorrone.com/). [Here](http://www.philliptorrone.com/option3/) you can see all the pictures he took of himself every 30 minutes, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 3 weeks. Either he doesn't need any sleep or he stopped at night from time to time though. :)

&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: He really doesn't seem to sleep a lot, as of [Joi Ito's post about the endavor](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/12/25/phillip_torrones_moblog_maddness.html).
