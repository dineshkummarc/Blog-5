Blogtalk 2.0 just took place in Vienna and Mena from [Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/) held a keynote which she now [posted online](http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/07/blogs_bandwidth.shtml). Another very interesting summary comes [from Nico](http://nico.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=394) though, who argues that her talk was really nothing more than a sales pitch because the Trotts, Mena and Ben, really were there only a few minutes or hours argueing that they were jet lagged or more. They should have been there longer when they chose to come which I can to agree with, partly. The problem here is that first Nico is competing with them directly, and even more importantly, because I don't really believe this will cloud Nico's judgements, the Trotts have an amazingly difficult schedule. They are wanted everywhere and I presume that they are currently trying to fulfil that need or want. They shouldn't but they likely feel that they have to. they have grown a lot faster than was good for them, or rather, blogging has become so important and the are the Ubergods of it. That makes time management extremely hard. They now need to think strategy. Who are the really important ones? Where do we need to go? Need as in need! They want to be everywhere but they can't. 

But getting back to Nico's post, it's great! I do believe in eLearning/Knowledge management type blogs though, so am in the camp of the people that believe in it, which he believes that mostly talk among themselves. I'd take it a step further, in that eLearning/Knowledge management blogs only work when they are done for yourself, otherwise they just don't. I do the OUBS Blog for myself, and am getting a lot of amazing feedback from it. But I still do it for myself. It is also nice to know that Macs are gaining traction in the connectors, multipliers, in the people that are getting other people to get stuff. Great! That's that now though. Back to bed.
