Great stuff from Cringely in his latest collumn named [Seeing Is Believing](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20051013.html). It talks first about what might happen in relation to the Video part of iPod and iTunes and especially mentions DVDstation's deal to let you fill up your iPod with HD quality movies at a DVDstation.

The second even more interesting bit, at least for me personally, is the trials of finding out how AdWords works with the help of the Taguchi Method. Great reply from Google included.
