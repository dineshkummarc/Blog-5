Fast Company has a very good article about Jeff Bezos entitled [&lt;i&gt;Inside the Mind of Jeff Bezos&lt;/i&gt;](http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/85/bezos_1.html) and I highly suggest you read it. It resonates clearly with me currently as it is one of the things that shows that customer focus is key. And not want-to-be customer focus. Real customer focus, above everything else. Yes, you have to manage that customer focus. You have to know your numbers. But at the end, what counts is customer focus. It also strikes me because he keeps teams fairly small and nimble and quick. Google does the same. This is something that needs to be thought of when building up a company structure. We still think in hierarchies, and to a small bit we need them, but overall, you need to give people the power to change their work environment and engage the customer and make a difference. We don't really care for a higher title as long as we can do things.
