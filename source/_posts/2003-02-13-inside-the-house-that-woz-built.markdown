Wired has an article (&lt;a title=&quot;Inside the House That Woz Built&quot; href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,57594,00.html&quot;&gt;Wired News: Inside the House That Woz Built) about Steve Wozniak, or [WOZ](http://www.woz.org/) in short, in which they say that he is moving to a new house because his old one is in an area with no GSM reception. Now that's a reason to move I agree with! WOZ is working on some wireless venture too, so that obviously strengthens the case for a move. The article is a great read for the information about his houses alone though.
