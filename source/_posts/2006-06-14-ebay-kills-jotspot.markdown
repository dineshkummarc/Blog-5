&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2006/06/ebay_dives_into.html?campaign_id=rss_blog_blogspotting&quot;&gt;eBay, arguably the original Web 2.0 company, is sure latching onto the newfangled 2.0 stuff. Today, it announced eBay Wiki, with service hosted by JotSpot.

Ah well. Our own JotSpot installations just dropped dead, so is ebaywiki.com and jot.com. I presume they just folded under the load, which should not happen. We will see when they are back up.

Congratulations to the JotSpot team though!

**Update**: Back up already. After a few minutes. Good luck to all of us for the rest of the day. :)
