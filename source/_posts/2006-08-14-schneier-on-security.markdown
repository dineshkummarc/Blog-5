Heiko [points me](http://www.hebig.com/archives/003940.shtml) to [this article](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/08/terrorism_secur.html) by Bruce Schneier about last week's Terrorism Arrests, which I barely noticed by the way due to heads down work on Ormigo. Anyway, here is a good quote:

*None of the airplane security measures implemented because of 9/11 -- no-fly lists, secondary screening, prohibitions against pocket knives and corkscrews -- had anything to do with last week's arrests. And they wouldn't have prevented the planned attacks, had the terrorists not been arrested. A national ID card wouldn't have made a difference, either. *

*Instead, the arrests are a victory for old-fashioned intelligence and investigation. Details are still secret, but police in at least two countries were watching the terrorists for a long time. They followed leads, figured out who was talking to whom, and slowly pieced together both the network and the plot. *

The full article goes in a lot more detail but yes, he is right. As [Richard Jackson said](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin): *Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.*
