Maybe not data centers in plural but Ben Rathbone has painted on of the walls in one of their data center. You can see a Google Blog posting about it [here](http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/04/i-googlebot.html). That's actually what I think should be flowing more in the Google Blog. That gives the company a more human side again. Put stuff on there you wouldn't expect, totally un-profit-related.
