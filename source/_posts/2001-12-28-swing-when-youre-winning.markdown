Ok, I have to admit it and I think many of you should try the album out.

Robbie Williams - Swing when you're winning

It's Robbie Williams performing old swing classics. He wowed the crowd when performing the album (never heard before) at the Royal Albert Hall with the Royal Albert Hall Swing Orchestra. It sold 1 Million copies within a week, the album that is. A DVD seems to be out from the concert, the audio cd is a normal studio recording.

You have most likely heard of it already, but I needed to point it out. Just listening to the live concert recorded from the TV.

The CD: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005RFVL/qid=1009551893/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_71_1/104-6418932-6975136

I only found the DVD of the concert in Germany: http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005T7AQ/qid=1009552579/sr=8-4/ref=sr_aps_prod_4_2/028-5161678-0973338

But co.uk should work also. It's called Robbie Williams - Live At The Albert
