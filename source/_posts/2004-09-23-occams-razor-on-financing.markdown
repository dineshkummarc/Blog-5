Occam's Razor is growing into a wonderful resource for me, and I still have lots of his stuff clipped in [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/). One of these stories which I now took a closer look at is his view on [Equity vs Dept financing](http://mgoldberg.typepad.com/occams_razor/2004/09/equity_vs_dept_.html) which holds some interesting ideas. The Venture Leasing he discusses sounds interesting.

Related to this are his posts on [ the new benchmark capital fund that just closed for europe](http://mgoldberg.typepad.com/occams_razor/2004/09/benchmark_capit.html) and [Building a good VC pitch](http://mgoldberg.typepad.com/occams_razor/2004/09/building_a_good.html).
