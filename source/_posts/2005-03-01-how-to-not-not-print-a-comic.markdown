&lt;p&gt;Let's presume you run a big newspaper, let's say the Tribune, and you run a comic in the paper. Then suddenly something fairly controversial pops up in the comic and you choose ... yes ... to not print it. What do YOU think the blogging community will do? (Hands rising ... I KNOW I KNOW.) Correct: reprint it:[&lt;img width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;81&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Bo050228&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.thylmann.net/images/bo050228.gif&quot; /&gt;](http://owt.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/bo050228.gif)&lt;/p&gt;

Now that it's out, have a good laugh. Oh, it's a [joke](http://www.answers.com/joke), it's funny, and no we don't all want to say the US president is taking drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
