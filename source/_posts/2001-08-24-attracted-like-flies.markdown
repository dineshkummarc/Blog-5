Two friends sat on our roof yesterday and they lit some torches attached to the railings. They could be seen all over the market which resulted in a girl and a boy who just finished school ringing the door bell because they wanted to look at the view and later another couple, close to 30, came up too. 

This place is a real nice way to meet new people. We had some nice conversations at that time. I would have not rang a door bell though at 2300 in a place I did not know. :)
