Here's a list I just received of some interesting items. Most might already be widely known, if not all of them, but they still made me smile. Read on.





*Why the sun lightens
our hair, but darkens our skin?*

*Why women can't put on
mascara with their mouth closed?*

*Why you don't ever see
the headline: &quot;Psychic Wins Lottery&quot;?*

*&amp;nbsp;*

*In case you need
further proof that the human race is doomed because of stupidity, here are some
actual label instructions on consumer goods:*

*&amp;nbsp;*

only time I have to work on my hair).*

*(The shoplifter
special?)*

*-&quot;Directions:&amp;nbsp; Use
like regular soap&quot;.*

*(And that would be
how???)*

*_On some frozen
dinners:_*

*-&quot;Serving
suggestion:&amp;nbsp; Defrost&quot;.*

*(But, it's just a
suggestion).*

to stop chain with your hands or genitals&quot;.*

*(Was there a lot of
this happening somewhere?)*

* * I don't blame
the company, I blame the parents for this one:*

*_On a child's superman
costume:_*

*&quot;Wearing of this
garment does not enable you to fly&quot;.*

*&amp;nbsp;*

*Now that you've smiled
at least once, it's your turn to spread the stupidity and send this to someone
you want to bring a smile to (maybe even*

*a chuckle)...in other
words send it to everyone.&amp;nbsp; We all need to smile every once in a while.*

I hope it made you smile too :)
