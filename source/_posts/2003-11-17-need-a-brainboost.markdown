[BrainBoost](http://brainboost.com/) is a &quot;Question Answering Engine&quot;, meaning that you plug in a question like &quot;[When is Christmas?](http://brainboost.com:444/search.asp?Q=When+is+Christmas%3F&amp;QT=1&amp;x=0&amp;y=0)&quot; (gets an exact result) or &quot;[How are pancakes made?](http://brainboost.com:444/search.asp?Q=How+are+pancakes+made%3F&amp;QT=1&amp;submit1=Ask+BrainBoost)&quot;, which gets a lot of different results. [MIT's Start](http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/infolab/ailab.html) seems to be another natural language search engine that actually did a bit better on the pancake question, giving me the webster definition directly.
