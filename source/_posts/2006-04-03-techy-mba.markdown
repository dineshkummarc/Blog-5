Brad Feld has [posted his thoughts about doing an MBA](http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2006/04/dear_ms_an_mba.html) or a similar degree and I am glad I fit.

*If you are a techie but like the business side of things, want to get an intellectual (and functional grounding) in business stuff, want a two year break from life, and want to meet interesting people, go to business school. But please - donâ€™t worry about whether you are getting an SM or an MS or an MBA - thatâ€™s not what you are going for.*

Ok, I was more of a techy, and I did do an MBA for mostly those reasons, just that I did it at the [Open University Business School](http://oubs.open.ac.uk/) which allowed me to do it part time, while continuing to work, over 4 years. For all those in technology out there that want to get a sound base to stand on business wise, I can only suggest it. But, you really need to want and like all the business stuff or you will fail.
