Just saw [Catch me if you can](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0264464) and I had a great time. Wonderful movie I have to say. It was just the right mix of fun, existing, good characters and interesting story. I am not sure at this time but if this is really a true story then it is a very cool story. 

In a related note, I finally managed to clear up all my bills and things for last year and generally got a little bit of order into my things. A very productive weekend, including helping a friend move.
