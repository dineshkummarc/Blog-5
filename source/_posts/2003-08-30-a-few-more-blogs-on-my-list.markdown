Granted, blogging has become some kind of hype at the moment but the personal touch enabled by blogging coupled with the bigger magazines out there starts to be interesting. I just added some blogs on my list after taking a look a [Movable Type Spotlight Sites](http://www.movabletype.org/spotlight-full.shtml). I didn't know that [About.com](http://www.about.com/) uses MT to manage their links, or rather to allow their contributors to manage their links. Amazing. I would really like to know since when they do that because this seems to be one of the most immense and oldest blogs arround then. But there are other interesting ones. [InfoWorld's TechWatch](http://archive.infoworld.com/techwatch/) seems to be a great site to stay up to speed on various happening out there in tech world that might not be so evident based on the major news sites out there. [Fresh Inc.](http://blog.inc.com/) is the blog by the mag Inc.com. and great for those who have found their passion in business I'd say. 

I really desperately need to set up an online RSS reader so I can manage all those things together because I am sick of switching and maintaining different lists. I tried one already but I don't like it anymore, so I need to switch again. Any suggestions are welcome.
