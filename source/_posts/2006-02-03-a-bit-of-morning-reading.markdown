Check out the [Interview with the world's laziest man](http://www.svabhinava.org/friends/PaulWilson/LaziestMan-frame.html) to learn about somebody that built two very big companies and believes in work having to be fun, meaning that he has never really worked. 

The Guardian has a [wonderful story](http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,,1409903,00.html) on Daniel Tammet, an autistic savant. The cool thing about him is that he can explain how his brain seems to work. Very insightful. Also, did you know Kim Peek read 7600 books up till now and he can read two pages at once? One with the left and one with the right eye. Kim is the guy that Rain Man was modeled from.
