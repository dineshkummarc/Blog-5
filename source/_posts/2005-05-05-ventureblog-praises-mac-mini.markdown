VentureBlog calls the Mac Mini [The New New Internet Computer](http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2005/001209.html) and David Hornik gives some great examples on where it is used. I really like the idea of one of his portfolio companies sending their enterprise software, pre-installed, on a Mac Mini to beta customers. If you really rely heavily on web applications in your enterprise, then what kind of computer you are running is really not that important. It really pains me that I don't need another computer at this time. :)
