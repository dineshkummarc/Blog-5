We just sent out the press release that we were able to attract Michael Kleindl as a second Angel Investor for [Ormigo](https://ormigo.com/). The German [press release is here](http://blog.ormigo.com/2007/presse/michael-kleindl-steigt-als-zweiter-investor-bei-ormigo-ein/) and for a bit more information in English, check out [this story](http://www.thealarmclock.com/euro/archives/2007/06/ormigo_brings_in_sec_1.html) on alarm:clock euro.

After HemjÃ¶ Klein, we are very happy to be able to welcome Michael Kleindl on board, who has been helping us amazingly in terms of contacts in the internet media industry. And we thought we have good contacts ;)

To give you an idea on why Michael invested, I'll try to translate his German quote from the press release.

â€žThe local advertising market is one of the very big growth markets. With it's concept, Ormigo, the two founders and the technology is ideally set-up to conquer not only the German market.Â  The business model is a perfect addition for every notable publisher.&quot; - Michael Kleindl

Tell me if you have a better translation :) I would only like to add one thing, namely the team we have managed to attract to Ormigo. I am very thankful to all of them for taking the leap and trusting us to do the right thing. The experience and level of dedication that flows through our offices is a wonderful sight. Thanks for sharing the vision.
