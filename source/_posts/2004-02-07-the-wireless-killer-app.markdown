Great post by Russel Beattie on Crosswords having the potential to be a killer app on mobile phones. I actually like his approach to get to this point and have been wondering about things like that a lot of times. I was more going down the road of massively multiplayer roleplaying games, but sometimes it's the simplet hings that make it. &lt;a title=&quot;Russell Beattie Notebook&quot; href=&quot;http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1001742.html&quot;&gt;Read his post here.&lt;/a&gt;
