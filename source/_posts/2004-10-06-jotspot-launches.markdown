I have just received word that [JotSpot](http://www.jotspot.com/) has just been officially launched at Web 2.0 (it doesn't show on the site yet ;)). There is already an article on Business Week right here: &lt;a title=&quot;Do-It-Yourself Software for All?&quot; href=&quot;http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2004/tc2004106_2351.htm?chan=db&quot;&gt;Do-It-Yourself Software for All?&lt;/a&gt;. JotSpot is the Wiki I got demoed by Joe Kraus some time ago but could only [hint at](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/09/wiki_and_then_s.html). I have been using the system for some time now and still very much like it. Congratulations to the team behind it. Looking forward to seeing people talk about it. 

The very interesting stuff, next to it being a nice Wiki with Security and a WYSIWYG editor and some more nice bits, is that you can write quasi-applications in it. That's really why I think their biggest competitors will be enterprise portal players like Plumtree. They are going beyond Wikis with this one. Now back to work but I'll post more about it when it comes. Stay tuned!

&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: [Jot](http://www.jot.com/) is now online! Have a great tour! :)
