I have somebody in my current study group that is working in a company doing medical devices. They are delivering when the customer needs it and I mean that literaly. It happens, though rarely, that a physician calls from the operating room and says that they need some little item in a specific size and then somebody will jump in a car or even use a helicopter to deliver that. Cool :)
