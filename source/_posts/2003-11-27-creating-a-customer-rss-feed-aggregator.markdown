RSS is getting bigger and bigger and W. Jason Gilmore introduces us  to &lt;a title=&quot;Creating a Custom RSS Feed Aggregator&quot; href=&quot;http://developer.com/xml/article.php/3113931&quot;&gt;Creating a Custom RSS Feed Aggregator&lt;/a&gt; with PHP, MySQL and the Magpie RSS parser. I am currently showing some RSS feeds on the frontpage but that's just a default thing, not with a MySQL database and user configurability. It might be an interesting experiment to build something like that.
