Heiko has a great story showing how hard computers are still to use these days, at least for the average user: &lt;a title=&quot;Mom wants to email an attachment by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hebig.com/archives/002127.shtml&quot;&gt;Mom wants to email an attachment&lt;/a&gt;

I can so feel with him. It's the basic things that are still very hard to grasp for somebody who doesn't use these things daily and doesn't go behind how it works once. I mean where do you save your file should be of no importance. It should just open whenever you want to. Maybe that needs an additional interface, and maybe a database with versioning and things. We have the storage. We just need the interface.
