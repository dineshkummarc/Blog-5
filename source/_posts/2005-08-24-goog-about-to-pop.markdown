John Battelle [has a good link](http://battellemedia.com/archives/001819.php) to a the WSJ. The article makes me remember my [Gasoil Inc](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/02/what_gasoil_inc.html) thoughts again (By the way, Gasoil is not listed in the personal profiles of the Google people anymore.) As the article states, it looks like Google is thinking themselves that GOOG is overvalued. They have no apparent reason to sell another $4 billion in stock, unless they think it will crash sooner or later, which means getting cash is good. On top of that, Insiders have sold $3 billion in stock (!!! $3 billion !!!) and internally, Google now does not issue stock options anymore (which would be worthless if the stock crashes) but Google Stock Units, which will not crash with the stock price it seems. All highly strange stuff if you think about it. Oh, and Google's Talk service, which is built on Jabber, is all right but it seems to be only able to talk to people that use Jabber with Google Talk accounts and now with all the Jabber users. So much for interoperability.
