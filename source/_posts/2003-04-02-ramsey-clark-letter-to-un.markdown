Just &lt;a title=&quot;birdhouse.org :: U.N. Dues, Stockpiles, and Sanctions&quot; href=&quot;http://www.birdhouse.org/blog/archives/000769.php&quot;&gt;read on Scot Hacker's blog about [Ramsey Clark's Letter to UN](http://www.casi.org.uk/discuss/1998/msg00300.html) from 1998. 

*The notion that Iraq is a threat to the region is a false 
fantasy created by the U.S. to justify its vast military 
presence in the region, to dominate the oil resources and 
to contain Islam.  Iraq is no threat to its neighbors as 
every Security Council member knows.  It is barely able to 
survive.  Turkey regularly attacks the Kurdish people and 
others living on northern Iraqi soil at will with U.S. 
support and U.N. acquiescence.  There are many nations on 
earth that pose far greater threats of minor violence and 
to world peace than Iraq.  As the recently published 
&quot;Israel and the Bomb&quot;, Columbia University Press, again 
demonstrates, Israel developed and has manufactured some 
hundreds of nuclear bombs in violation of Security Council 
resolutions and international law. *

Lot's more interesting stuff.
