You can now get RSS Feeds from the iTunes Music Story and they are even configurable to your preferences right [here](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/MRSS/rssGenerator)! I, absolutely [agree with nico](http://lumma.de/mt/archives/000826.html) in that I want iTMS in Germany. They seem to be doing several of the right things and getting a feed of your favorite, or potentially favorite, new releases would be great.
