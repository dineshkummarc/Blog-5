Great Comfy Sofa show [Lars from OpenBC](http://blog.openbc.com/2006/04/the_comfy_sofa__1.html) where he gives out a lot of detail about the company, which is now 35 people and that with outsourced IT, at least partly for all I know. Here are a few numbers from the show. 70% of the users of OpenBC have been active in the last 30 days and sometimes 17.000 are online at the same time. They will also add taging and more RSS feeds like visits to your profile and now (and I requested this for some time!) a feed about [company changes within your contacts](http://blog.openbc.com/2006/04/how_do_i_know_i.html)! Then comes the cash part though. LinkedIn seems to be doing 10 million USD this year with their 5 million users but OpenBC with their over a million seems to be doing over 10 million (USD or EUR, not sure) too! That is a heavy number! Again congratulations for a great service.
