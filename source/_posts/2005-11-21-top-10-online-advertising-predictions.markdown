Henning blogged [the Top 10 Online Advertising Predictions from 24/7](http://www.henninglange.com/2005/11/top_10_online_a.html) and it includes some I most certainly agree with. The original report is [here](http://www.247realmedia.com/about/press_2005/2005-11-08.html) and following are some of my ideas:

	* Consumer-generated media will become increasingly attractive to advertisers: No shit, blogs and podcasting are sure to find some interest, and with [PodShow](http://www.podshow.com/) pushing their 8 Million USD into Podcasting, we are sure to see some traction there. AdSense will likely continue to dominate Blogs, but we will see where it goes.
	* Advertisers shift spending to internet due to better controllability: Yep.
	* Online advertisers move away from high-profile, high-CPM ad buys towards better targeting: This kind of reads like &quot;yes, the prices were too high&quot;. Sure. They were.
	* Technology and better data access will transform online advertising success to a formulaic equation: Yep, at least partly,  and [AttentionTrust](http://www.attentiontrust.org) might help to get the data out there and consumers aware of its value.
	* Performance-based pricing models will demonstrate the true value of search engine marketing (SEM) as a lead generation channel: Yes and no. Lead generation is like an intent funnel. A click in a search engine is a click of the right intent as some might say, and in a content network this is not necessarily the case. Taking it one step further, a lead is a clearer intent than a click and this can apply everywhere, also a content network. In this sense, lead based advertising can go a very long way. If it's trackable, it will be tracked. Lead based advertising is something that I truly believe in, which is why I founded a company in the space, after already having build the technology behind one of the biggest performance marketing networks in Germany. More to come.
