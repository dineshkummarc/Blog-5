That's the end of a quote from Steve Ballmer, which he seems to have said to an ex-Microsoft Engineer who &quot;defected&quot; to Google. Check out the full story here: [John Battelle's Searchblog: Ballmer Throws A Chair At &quot;F*ing Google&quot;](http://battellemedia.com/archives/001835.php).

Oh, did you know that &lt;I&gt;Fucking Eric Schmidt is a fucking pussy&lt;/I&gt;? ;) Oh the fun war between Microsoft and Google.
