The [Les Blogs 2.0 preliminary program](http://lesblogs.typepad.com/blog/2005/11/les_blogs_20_pr.html) has been updated. The Les Blogs 2.0 Party will be sponsored by [Edelman](http://www.edelman.com), who actually just released a study on blogging in a corporation together with Intelliseek. The event is getting better and better. :)
