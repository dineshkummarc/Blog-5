or Second Life actually but in any case, take a look at [this video](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2006/06/joi_ito_a_podca.html) that Joi and Loic took together. In it Joi explains everything about his WoW guild and the general structure of the game. Great stuff and a lot to learn about Web 3.0. Yes, that's what some people seem to call it. While I do not believe that these games will replace the web as it exists today, I do think that a lot of the future of marketing will be within those games. Great stuff for the companies in the space.
