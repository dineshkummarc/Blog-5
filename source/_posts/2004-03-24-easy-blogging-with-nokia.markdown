MobileWhack has now been shown [Nokia's PhotoBlog software](http://www.mobilewhack.com/handset/nokia/apps/nokia_photoblog.html) allowing you to post to any blog that supports the Atom specs with just a few clicks from within your phone. The app looks nice and simple too. Good to see Nokia going into this direction. Don't mistake PhotoBlog with [Lifeblog](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/03/lifeblog_seeing.html) which is not really a blogging but more of a logging application.
