Returned from egypt now and had a great relaxing holiday. Some photos are [here on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliver/tags/egypt/) and I am now in the final stages of preparing for my last exam on monday. Got through the eMails, went through my subscriptions and have lots of stuff marked for closer inspection.

I was good not doing too much computer things for a few days, even though I have to admit that I did have some pretty deep development language and IT discussions during the time with my brother.
