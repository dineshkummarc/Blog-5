I am actually not even done yet, but it already proves to be a wonderful book to read when founding or thinking of founding a company. Now [Paul reviewed it](http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2007/02/25/the_best_book_f.html) and [Guy did as well](http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007/03/founders_at_wor.html) and and they both love it. I can only agree. Yes, it is not something that you read to learn how to attract VCs, or to get a 3 step guide to launch a successful start-up. When you are starting a company though a bell rings in hundreds of places. I remember one part where one of the founders (I think it was Joe Krauss from Excite, JotSpot). When you are starting a company you have days where you think that you will rule the world, and the next day you wake up and you think it will all fall to pieces, and nothing between those days has changed. Nothing. You still have the drive to pull this through because you really believe in it and you think it is the right thing to do. There are endless of other parts in there that are a great read so I can only suggest buying the book.
