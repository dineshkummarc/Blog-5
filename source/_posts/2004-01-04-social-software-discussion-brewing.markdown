The discussion about social software is brewing here and there and now there is even one that should be followed (if only for the $1000 bet involved ;)) between Jeremy Zawodny and Richard Stokes. While Jeremy thinks that Social Software will go very far, with the current models not being the ones that money will be made on but that will build the foundation for the future application of the idea, Richard thinks that critical mass will not be reached, with critical mass being needed to really get people interested. This actually fits very well with &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;, which I am currently reading, being about that one point when an idea starts to take off. 

But anyway. I suggest you start reading [here](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001341.html) and follow the updates. :)
