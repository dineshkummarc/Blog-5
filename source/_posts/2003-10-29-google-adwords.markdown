Good [article about Google AdWords](http://rss.com.com/2100-1024_3-5098295.html) and them buying Sprinks on News.com. It seems that Google has already bought a rival only to use their own technology before. They might only be interested in the ad-realestate that Sprinks has and getting them out of the picture, which is something that I can very much believe. Scary though.
