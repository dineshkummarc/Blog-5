I just recently wrote an article about [wireless blogging](http://www.infosync.no/show.php?id=2583) and thankfully had a comment on there by somebody who wrote an application for an e-mail to blog gateway, which is actually all you need. Now this is fun. Now I really need to play with [this](http://graflex.org/klotz/hiptop/blogrouter) I think.
