Heiko is calling everyone to blog at &lt;a title=&quot;We need more weblogs&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hebig.com/archives/001924.shtml&quot;&gt;*We need more weblogs* and with some of his posts I am continuously wondering if means it or if he just has a wonderful time making fun of something I didn't read yet :)

One might say that we don't really really need more content and we especially do not need to read more discussions, at least not in parallel. Then again I'd love to, which again is a bit sick if you think about it. But I think he means it, especially reading his post [*Beth Cox is sceptical*](http://www.hebig.com/archives/001926.shtml) in which he quotes Beth as saying that she would be passing on the blogging trend for now as she doesn't think it's more than a little brand marketing. He responds by saying to just &quot;*keep on writing little articles for online publications that sell &quot;blogging&quot; as a &quot;trend&quot; years after it started. Keep on spending hours of updating your web site and money on keyword advertising. No, weblogs don't have anything to do with it. Really.*

That's what I mean when I say that I wonder if I have to turn most of the things Heiko says around. So when is the next big blogger meeting to really get to know everyone? :)
