I had a brilliant idea, probably the last one having it really. I just closed down commenting on [the columbia shuttle post](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2003/02/columbia_shuttl.html). Nobody really wants to comment on that but spammers seem to love that post for feeding their spam bots. So now the commenting on that is closed. Fun. Less spam. Easy ;)
