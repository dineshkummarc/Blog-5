&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Feld for [pointing me](http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2007/07/im_feeling_liji.html) to (his investment) [Lijit](http://www.lijit.com/). Feld already invested early in [Feedburner](http://feedburner.com/), now belonging to Google (thanks for making the pro stats free by the way ;)). Hence, I needed to at least give Lijit a try and I do like it. Install is easy enough, also on Wordpress if you know a bit of HTML (tiny bit) and the Lightbox version for keeping search on your site is great. The entire idea holds great promise. If you search on my blog via the Lijit search it will first go over all my blog posts, then include things like Bluedot and my OPML file from my RSS reader. Not sure how it all ties together as it should take the blogs from the OPML file and include results form those pages, which I presume it does. Above that it has my LinkedIn connection and Xing connection (but I would probably have to give up my login credentials) so it can (theoretically in the future) look at my network and see which people I trust, possibly knowing their Lijit accounts ... and the list goes on. Very cool indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One short request: Please give me the code to just add a search box with GO at the end without the bells and whistles as I would like to exchange the search box at the top of the blog too. And there should not be any Lijit there and such. People will see it soon enough when they search.&lt;/p&gt;
