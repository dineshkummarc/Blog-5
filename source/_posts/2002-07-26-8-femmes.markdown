I have just seen &quot;8 Femmes&quot; and I am very sorry to say that it is one of the worst movies I have seen in ages.

Sure. It's special. There are probably lots of great cinematography elements. It's out of the ordinary and I might have perceived it better if I were able to see it in french instead of the horrible german version.

Imagine this. There are 8 women, somebody is murdered and they could all have done it. Through all of this, I couldn't care less who was it. I did not feel any suspense, seriously. I am wondering myself why, but that's just how it is. And they sing. 

Ok, in the end, there was lots to talk about and I had several good laughs. It was well played by everybody, very well even. But I seriously thought about taking out my palm to read some stuff sometimes. The plot just doesn't hold up when you think about it from time to time. 

Some people will love it. Others will hate it. People walked out of the cinema before the end of the film and the entire cinema seems to have been laughing at how stupid the film was getting. Sometimes you thought you were watching a parody. 

Sorry, needed to vent.
