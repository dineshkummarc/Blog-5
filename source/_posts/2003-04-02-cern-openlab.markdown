Great stuff. With their last collider, CERN was using huge amounts of data which had to be stored on solid state harddisk at the time of the particle collision because harddisks were to slow. Now they are trying to prove the Higgs Boson by 2007... or rather, they are starting by then. So this is from the site about their computing project to make the data collection possible: *Welcome ! The CERN openlab is a collaboration between CERN and industrial partners to develop data-intensive Grid technologies to be used by the worldwide community of scientists working at the next-generation Large Hadron Collider. These experiments will generate enormous amounts of data - several million gigabytes a year - and will require a computing environment thousands of times more powerful and functional than anything running on today's Internet.
