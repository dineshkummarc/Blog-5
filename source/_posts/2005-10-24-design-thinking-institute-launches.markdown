Ralf just [posted about](http://www.design-management.de/archive/2005/10/new-brainchild-designthinkinginstitutecom/) the launch of the [Design Thinking Institute](http://www.designthinkinginstitute.com/) and already has a very good post about [Organizational Democracy](http://www.designthinkinginstitute.com/2005/10/23/organizational-democracy-and-design-thinking-worldblu-forum-washington-dc/) online, which is very much along the line of my thinking. Here is what organizational democracy is about:


* Business
* Conversations
* Decentralized Networks
* Leadership
* Universal ideals
* Strategy
* Knowing when to be fast AND when to be slow
* Giving up the delusion that you're in control
* profits and people
* creating meaningful work
* Being a great workplace for those who can thrive in a decentralized and dynamic environment
* Making decisions
* A quadruple bottom-line (financial, community, external environment AND internal environment)
* ongoing participation in the things that matter


Great stuff really and especially important if you want to build up knowledge inside your company and keep people interested, motivated and sticking.
