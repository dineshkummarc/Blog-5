Ralf just [posted about](http://www.design-management.de/archive/2005/10/new-brainchild-designthinkinginstitutecom/) the launch of the [Design Thinking Institute](http://www.designthinkinginstitute.com/) and already has a very good post about [Organizational Democracy](http://www.designthinkinginstitute.com/2005/10/23/organizational-democracy-and-design-thinking-worldblu-forum-washington-dc/) online, which is very much along the line of my thinking. Here is what organizational democracy is about:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decentralized Networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leadership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Universal ideals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing when to be fast AND when to be slow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving up the delusion that you're in control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;profits and people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating meaningful work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being a great workplace for those who can thrive in a decentralized and dynamic environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making decisions
&lt;li&gt;A quadruple bottom-line (financial, community, external environment AND internal environment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ongoing participation in the things that matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Great stuff really and especially important if you want to build up knowledge inside your company and keep people interested, motivated and sticking.
