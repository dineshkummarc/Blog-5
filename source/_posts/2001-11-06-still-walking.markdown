This Nokia Game stuff is interesting. My character, Alpha, is currently walking to the cinema. About 5-6 hours ago I choose that way and it was said to be 6 hours. I just logged in to the game and Alpha is still walking ;) I'll have to log in again later. This is getting fun. Actually it is totally stupid but what I like is that you are playing for several weeks, can just forget it for a few hours but never really leave the game. That makes it interesting enough. Cool concept.
