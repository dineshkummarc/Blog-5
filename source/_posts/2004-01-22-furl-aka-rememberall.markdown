Thanks to [John Battelle's mention](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000249.php) of it, I just looked at [Furl](http://www.furl.net/).  To simply quote what John quoted: 

*Furl is a new web browsing tool that lets you save and organize thousands of useful web pages (you know, the ones you want to save for future reference but then can never find again) in a personal &quot;web page filing cabinet&quot;.

Once saved, you can effortlessly find any page again later using a powerful full text search tool. With Furl you can forget trying to save and organize dozens of bookmarks, forget saving web pages to your desktop, in fact forget everything except how to find a useful web page again next time you need it. *

And the interface looks very nice. Many of the important things I blog anyway but there is lots of stuff you see all over the day and you end up not finding them anymore because you didn't bookmark them, they are in the wrong inbox, they are on the wrong computer, you simply forgot, or the search engine made a little dance and doesn't find it anymore. There might be a million reasons. Now with one little click, I got it. Very nice.  And I can even rate the page, put keywords in there or comments. I'll really be trying to use this. Very nice. ... Oh, I am repeating myself ;)

**Update**: You can see my stuff [here](http://www.furl.net/members/olivert) and can even get a [RSS Feed of my documents!!!](http://www.furl.net/members/olivert/rss.xml) This is getting cooler by the minute :)
