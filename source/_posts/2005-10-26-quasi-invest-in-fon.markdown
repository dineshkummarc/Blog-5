Are you a top blogger in germany? I probably miss the mark a little bit. But if you are, check out [this post](http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/fon/bloggers-of-the-world-uniteand-join-our-board.html) by Martin where he offers top bloggers in every country a 1% share in FON of that country as well as a seat on the board. Really building a cool grass roots system there.
