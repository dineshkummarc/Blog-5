I am wondering if I am not slowly but surely getting into problems. I like trying out things and there is a lot of great stuff out there. Aggregators of your personal life are starting to come up but this actually poses a problem.

I recently made a change in how I [blog](http://blog.thylmann.net/), [twitter](http://twitter.com/olivert), [tumble](http://stuff.thylmann.net/), the like. Real thoughts go in here, little notes go into twitter, which is more of a conversation. All the stuff in between now actually ends up on [my Tumblr Blog](http://stuff.thylmann.net/). But the Tumblr Blog actually aggregates [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) tags tagged linkblog, as well as [flickr](http://flickr.com) posts with tag moblog and my [kyte.tv](http://kyte.tv) posts as well as [qik](http://qik.com/oliver) live streams. It kind of aggregates my short thoughts.

Above that I also installed [Noserub on my own server](http://id.thylmann.net/othylmann), for a large part because [Dirk](http://olbertz.de) works at [Ormigo](http://ormigo.com/) and because I think it is one of the most interesting implementations in the open social graph movement. It aggregates all my accounts into one view. I can't really have it aggregate my Tumblr blog because that would double aggregate a lot of stuff. It is actually more likely that I will remove some stuff and only have it take the Tumblr blog. That is actually more what goes on in my life that might interest other people than all the other stuff.

This is also one of the reasons I kept twitter out of the aggregation via Tumblr, because it's kind of a different level that people have to be able to choose distinctly to follow.

What we really need is something that will aggregate all my feeds, and somehow allows my friends to selectively subscribe to that stream of my ideas, somehow only giving them what might interest them, maybe based on what they read. This would actually be a very fun project. There you go, another start-up idea for somebody out there. Even better would be if somebody would write something that extends Noserub to that extend. I am sure Dirk would not mind.

With that off my chest, on to some more work :)
