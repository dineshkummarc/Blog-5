[Thijs briefly reviews Aperture](http://blog.taospace.com/2005/12/aperture_a_brie.html) and likes what he sees. The RAW converter seems to be lacking a bit but I really presume this will be fixed soon, especially in a product this expensive. But it seems that if you are doing stuff with photos, you should take a look at this.
