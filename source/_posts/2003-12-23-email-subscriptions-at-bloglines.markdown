Now this is a cool feature!!! You can now create eMail Subscriptions at [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/). What this means is, that you get a special bloglines eMail address and use that to subscribe to a newsletter or something else that doesn't offer RSS. eMails sent there will then appear just like any RSS Subscription inside your My Blogs page. If you want to subscribe to some weird newsletter, you can do that and simply cancel the subscription and the eMail will become invalid and unsubscribed your are! You could also put one of these on your homepage as a contact form if you wanted and whenever it gets picked up by bots, you kill it. 

Bloglines, I thank you. Very nice.
