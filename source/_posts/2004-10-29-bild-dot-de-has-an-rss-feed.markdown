Ok, I just found out [via Heiko](http://www.hebig.com/archives/002597.shtml) that  [Bild.de has an RSS Feed now](http://www.bild.t-online.de/BTO/service/rss/rss.html)! Bild.de is one of the biggest sites in germany, one of the biggest papers in Germany too and had something like 270 Million page impressions in August ([See IVW Online](http://www.ivw-online.de/ausweisung/suchen.php)). They are big. They have stuff to loose. 

I said it [again](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/01/my_yahoo_rss_be.html) and [again](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2003/09/rss_articles.html) and [again](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/07/the_rss_bandwag.html) and [again](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/02/rss_catching_on.html) and other people like Heiko have said it too. RSS is coming and it is coming in force. Embrace it and worry about the implications later. The implications will be there anyway, it's just a matter of feeling them or being irrelevant.
