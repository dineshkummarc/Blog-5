&lt;p&gt;MSNBC has a story called [ title=&quot;MSNBC - The Tech-Support Generation&quot;&gt;The Tech-Support Generation](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6522314/site/newsweek/) which rings a bell. I am the technology guy in at least some part of my family and among lots of friends. This is generally a wonderful feeling and I like to help and will continue to do so in the future. But it is true that it sometimes is a weird thing that you go home or to friends and the first thing that happens is the question &quot;Can you fix my computer?&quot; :)&lt;/p&gt;
