I just had a great weekend with [Thijs](http://blog.taospace.com) and among others we took a photo shoot around a few locations in cologne. Later Thijs gave me a bit of a deeper introduction to the art of editing RAW files with the likes of Adobe Lightroom (currently in Beta). I might have overdone it a little bit but here is a set of shots from some industry structures from the last days, all changed around in Lightroom for giving them just that little bit of kick, or making the speciality of the scenery clearer.
