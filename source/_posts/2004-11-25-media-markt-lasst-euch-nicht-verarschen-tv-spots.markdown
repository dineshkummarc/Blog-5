&lt;p&gt;The german electronics super market Media Markt is currently running some great ads. You probably have to speak german to really understand them but the general idea is wonderful. In it a german TV Show host is making fun of some people in Media Markt, similar to how he does it in his shows. But it kind of comes on funny and in a good way, both for Media Markt and him. The tag line of the ads are (translated): Don't let them make fun of you, especially relating the price. Actually it's a german saying &quot;Lasst euch nicht verarschen&quot; which is a bit hard to translate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well now you can find all the TV Spots online, that's actually all I wanted to say: [ title=&quot;Media Markt. Lasst euch nicht verarschen. TV-Spots.&quot;&gt;Media Markt. Lasst euch nicht verarschen. TV-Spots](http://www.media-markt.de/lenv/tv/).&lt;/p&gt;
