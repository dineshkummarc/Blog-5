Thank to [this discussion](http://www.livejournal.com/community/macosx/1621311.html) I managed to set up a new user in my OS X.3 Installation. I somehow [still](http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000971.php) don't have the normal method working. Grrr... But it was nice finding out a bit of stuff about how to do it in the command line.
