[Citibank](http://www.citibank.com/), supposedly the biggest bank in the world, can't order the [Carlson Equity Asian Small Cap Fund](http://fonds.onvista.de/snapshot.html?ID_INSTRUMENT=107695) for me. What is that? I am just a little bit pissed off here. What good is a bank if I can't order a simple fund? Now I need to look at other similar ones and/or just buying it somewhere else. Sure, I get the full account for free, including trading for EUR 9,99 but what good is that if I can't order something. 

&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: Cortal Consors will allow me to have a savings plan on the fund as it is included in their [list of available funds for the savings plan](http://www.cortalconsors.de/sparen_anlegen/sparen/fondssparen/sparfaehige_fonds.html).
