With switching eMail Servers, I also attacked [Zoe](http://zoe.nu/) again and now all my outgoing mails on the laptop, at least there, are filtered through Zoe. Now I have all my eMails in Zoe which is just plain wonderful. Of course sending on the desktop will not filter through so it is not perfect yet. Having Zoe directly on the Laptop is nice though, meaning that a local server isn't the best option, even though I am thinking about it. But SurgeMail from [Netwinsite](http://netwinsite.com/) plus Zoe would actually make a nice thing for a corporate system. All I need on top of that is somewhere to have Contacts easily managable, which LDAP seems to be good at. Next on the list is learning more about LDAP then.
