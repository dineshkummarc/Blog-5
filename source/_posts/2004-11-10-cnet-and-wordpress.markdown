CNET and [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/)? Yes. I had this sitting in my Bloglines Clips for some time now wanting to blog about it, but it seems that CNET Networks has hired Matt Mullenweg, the guy behind WordPress. WordPress has been picking up steam in the blogosphere and seems to be a great application. I have to admit that I have been playing with it a bit myself, just for the fun of it. 

The interesting thing to ask yourself is what they will do with this. Sure, they might have just hired a very good developer and will use WordPress to keep abreast of the Blogging world out there, but that can't be all of it. They might have seen the power and might go into the blogging business to some extent. They do know news, they know how to run a big site and they know how to do it profitably. All in all they know some things about content, journalism, writing, advertising, the web, search engines, lots of stuff that is relevant for blogging too. Keep and eye on this one.
