I haven't been posting in a long time and to get back into it. Still not having a GMail Account, I needed something else and nice to post and this time, it will just be something I found via &lt;a title=&quot;Adam Curry's Weblog&quot; href=&quot;http://www.blognewsnetwork.com/members/0000001/2004/05/23.html#a5727&quot;&gt;Adam Curry's Weblog, namely, [Eric Idle's FCC Song](http://www.pythonline.com/plugs/idle/index.shtml). Yes, that's the Monty Python Eric Idle. The one and only. One of the masters. You can [download the song right here](http://www.pythonline.com/plugs/idle/index.shtml). Great stuff.
