I am currently thinking a lot about outsourcing for different reasons and TJ's post on [outsourcing your headquarter](http://www.tjacobi.com/archives/outsourcing_your_headquarter.html) is very interesting in that respect. Not only because it is about outsourcing but also about the power cities play in a knowledge economy and in relation to the connectedness of our current world. I had a nice short chat with the current knowledge management tutor and you can really start questioning whether you need to be in a city or even whether we need big cities at all, at least for corporations. [Kozoru](http://www.kozoru.com/) (great site, intriguing idea though not new) which the post by TJ is about, is actually sitting in some small town in the US where things a lot cheaper, a lot more beautiful and a lot more calm. Maybe the perfect setting for a startup that wants to get most bang for the buck. This might even be a competitive advantage for a startup that doesn't need a big factory or thousands of workers at one location. SocialText is similar here in that they simply don't have an office as such but work virtually. The world is changing, change with it people!
