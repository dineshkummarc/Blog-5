Some time ago (yes, I am somehow behind in my writing) I read Seth Godin's [Bootstrapper's Bible](http://www.changethis.com/8.BootstrappersBible) when it was published in [ChangeThis](http://www.changethis.com/). Sadly it's no longer free but if you are wondering about starting your own business any time, you should get your hands on a copy. It gives some great pointers on the difference between a freelancer and an entrepreneur, or which business to go in, what to watch out for, basic finance. Some simple rules for choosing your business model as an example:

* It should be profitable (yes, some still go into business with something that isn't)
* It should be protectible (I am not sure there, because they world might be changing too fast for keeping things protectible in the long term, of course it would be nice)
* It should be self-priming
* It should be adjustable
* It should have an exit strategy (optional)

That's a good list to think about when going into business. A good point follows: &quot;*Successful bootstrappers know this: Your business is about the process, it's not about the product.*&quot; Another important item is to redo the business plan and mission statement every three months. This thing should be short, but it gives a guiding light that needs to be pointing in the right direction.
