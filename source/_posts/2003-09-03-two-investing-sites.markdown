Two interesting investment sites I thought I'd mention here. One would be [ValuePro](http://www.valuepro.net/) which lets you use their Database for a discounted cash flow analysis for finding the value of a business or stock. The other would be [Value Hunter](http://www1.iinvestor.com/scripts/ValueHunter.asp), allowing you to screen stocks for diverse marks like P/E or CAGR and a mix of those.
