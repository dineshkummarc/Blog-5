&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Zawodny just linked to the [Google Insider Trades Listing](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=GOOG) which is now starting to fill with some sales. Always the interested one I started clicking around and now I am really wondering who &lt;em&gt;Gasoil Inc&lt;/em&gt; is. Sergey Brin seems to [be President](http://biz.yahoo.com/t/80/5092.html) and George Rayes (CFO Google) seem to [be CFO](http://biz.yahoo.com/t/20/976.html) and Omid Kordestani (Senior VP Google) also seems to [be Senior VP](http://biz.yahoo.com/t/81/5092.html) at Gasoil Inc. Oh, and Eric Schmidt [is CEO](http://biz.yahoo.com/t/71/1043.html) and Wayne Rosing is a poor guy as he is Senior VP at Google but [only VP](http://biz.yahoo.com/t/98/1005.html) at Gasoil Inc.. Larry Page is obviously [also President](http://biz.yahoo.com/t/67/3807.html) of Gasoil Inc and also CTO of [Island Pac Inc.](http://www.dbc.com/http2_data/squote.htx?TICKER=IPI&amp;TABLES=EXTEND&amp;SOURCE=$(SOURCE)). [Gasoil Inc.'s adress can be found here.](http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/divisions/og/ogdirectory/g.html) Both are not mentioned in the Google SEC filing from what I can see. My guess would be that they both just bought companies to put some money in an as Gasoil Inc is in Texas I presume this is a state that is doing good for its richest members. Can anyone shed a light on what is going on here?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: AlwaysOn has [picked it up too](http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=7917_0_5_0_C).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 3&lt;/strong&gt;: [What Gasoil Inc is](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/02/what_gasoil_inc.html) ... the solution. :)&lt;/p&gt;
