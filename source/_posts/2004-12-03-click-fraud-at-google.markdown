&lt;p&gt;CNN Money has an article up entitled &lt;em&gt;[ title=&quot;Google CFO sounds an alarm - Dec. 2, 2004&quot;&gt;Google CFO sounds an alarm](http://money.cnn.com/2004/12/02/technology/google_fraud/index.htm)&lt;/em&gt; which quotes the CFO of Google as saying: &quot;&lt;em&gt;I think something has to be done about this really, really quickly,
because I think, potentially, it threatens our business model.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; I said this to a lot of people again and again, but stepped back from it when I learned that there might be a way around this in mathematical methods like Fourier analysis. The problem remains to be there, especially if you consider the other side, the side the CFO is thinking about. He wants clean bills. He wants to invoice and pay things that are right. He doesn't want a Fourier corrected Click Count for the big 20million plus AdImpression Partners going out. He doesn't want to tell the street that they made $300 Million a quarter just to put in the notes that there might be a charge of $60 Million going against that due to uncertainty in clicks. The problem is that this is just how it is. This is not really 100% exact. But the system might not be as easy to adapt as they'd like.&lt;/p&gt;
