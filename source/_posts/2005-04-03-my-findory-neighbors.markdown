How all this stuff interlinks is extreme fun. I recently got a Google Alert that there is a new ranking in the top 50 ranks in Google for &quot;Oliver Thylmann&quot;. This one was [my Findory page](http://findory.com/source?source=Oliver%20Thylmann%26apos%3Bs%20Blog&amp;ib=1) listing extractions of my posts and related blogs visible in [my Findory Neighbors](http://findory.com/neighbors/?s=Oliver%20Thylmann%26apos%3Bs%20Blog&amp;ib=1). It also has a fun RSS feed giving me the related posts to my post, which already gave me the Google Patent info that I posted about just now. Very nice.
