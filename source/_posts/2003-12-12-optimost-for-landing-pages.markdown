Are you looking for a way to optimize your landing pages? [Optimost](http://www.optimost.com/) seems to have a solution that might work for some of you. You just provide the content elements and Optimost will build the different pages for you telling you which work best. This generally sounds like an interesting message, when you don't care for your CI or anything else. I would say this only works for companies doing it for themselves. If you do it for others, it is likely to be a hard sell at least.
