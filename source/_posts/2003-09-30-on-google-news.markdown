I put this in Business, because I can and because Google is ultimately about business but the thing they understood is that to ultimately be about business, you need to be about the consumer, without questioning. &lt;a title=&quot;Google News Creator Watches Portal Quiet Critics With 'Best News' Webby&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ojr.org/ojr/kramer/1064449044.php&quot;&gt;OJR article: Google News Creator Watches Portal Quiet Critics With 'Best News' Webby&lt;/a&gt;

[Google News](http://news.google.com/) is often attacked to not being a news site. Here is what the man behind it, [Krishna Bharat](http://searchwell.com/krishna/Krishna.Bharat.html), has to say about that: &lt;I&gt;The thing I think is indicative of a news source is that some portion of the world believes it's a news source. Who are we to tell them it's not news?&lt;/I&gt;

And this is a very interesting point in the Interview:

&lt;I&gt;OJR: Did you wonder if you had the right to do this with other people's sites?

KB: The nice thing about research is until you actually make a product, you just want to find out if it works. In the long run, the issue of rights had to be addressed. In a sense, it was a no-brainer because what we do fundamentally at Google is we take people to the content -- and this is another way to take people to the content. We don't manufacture content. We don't substitute our content for theirs.

Usually when people come to Google search, they tell us what they're looking for. In the context of news it's unfair to ask them to tell us what they're looking for -- because it's news. It's new. They may not know it's happening, so the burden is on us to tell them what's interesting and new. ...&lt;/I&gt;
