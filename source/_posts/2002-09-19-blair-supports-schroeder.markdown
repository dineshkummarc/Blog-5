As some of you might know, the german chancelor SchrÃ¶der has recently said that he is 100% against a war against Irak at this time and that Germany would not support the war. This is more or less it. It mostly focusses on the fact that the US should not do anything without the support by the UN. Also known should be that Blair (UK) is very much for the strike and behind the US. Now Blair said that he fully supports SchrÃ¶der in his view and thinks it is good that he said it and many of the questions raised are very valid. He also thinks that in the end, everybody will pull on one string. Very nice.
