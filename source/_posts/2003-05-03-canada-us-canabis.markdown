&lt;a title=&quot;U.S. warns Canada against easing pot laws&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/05/02/us_pot_rxn030502&quot;&gt;CBC News: U.S. warns Canada against easing pot laws&lt;/a&gt;. How much fun this will be to watch. Very harsh words from the US there and it's an interesting move on the part of Canada.

The Netherlands here let you buy pot in special shops and of course, many germans go over there to buy it. The thing is, here in germany, while it is not legal, the police is advised to not go after people who only have small quantities for personal use. They can take it, but that's like it, if even that. Let's see what happens with the US and Canada now ;)
