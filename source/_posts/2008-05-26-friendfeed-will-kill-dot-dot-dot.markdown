no it won't. Simply as that. Scoble thinks Friendfeed will win, [Arrington believes in Twitter](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/25/twitter-2/), so [does Steve Gillmor](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/24/blame-friendfeed/). Now Loic comes in an says [Friendfeed will kill Google Reader](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2008/05/friendfeed-is-g.html). Enough already people!

I do like Twitter, I do like Friendfeed and I do like Google Reader. And I don't think anyone will kill anyone here. Twitter is a communication system with a very clear focus. The noise level is way higher for Friendfeed and in terms of Google Reader, that's me desciding what to read in terms of sites. These things ar three totally different things and they will hopefully move their seperate ways.

I did start playing with the Friendfeed API though to see what interesting things can be done with it, so I do agree that there is a lot of power behind Friendfeed. But I have been using a similar system with Noserub for some time and I have my install at id.thylmann.net which actually allows me to stay master over my own data, which is something that is totally missed out here. The data Friendfeed aggregates is scary indeed.
