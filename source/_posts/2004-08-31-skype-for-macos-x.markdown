Now that I am home, I swiftly downloaded [Skype for MacOS X](http://www.skype.com/download_osx.html) to find out a) that it is very nice, b) that is doesn't take over the contacts I have on the windows box at work, c) that search somehow doesn't fully work or all my contact are hidden somehow. But it seems to be working and once again I prefer it to the windows version. My nickname is othylmann if you want to be able to start a chat some time in the future. I am looking forward to see how this develops. What is very nice I have to say is that I see tons of bloggers popping up say &quot;Yay! Finally, a MacOS X Version of Skype. Downloading now.&quot; This proves once again that MacOS X is extremely popular among bloggers. Great crowd to be with :)
