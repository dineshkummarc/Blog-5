Again a best seller that just came to by attention again recently when [Heiko](http://www.hebig.com/) posted about it. [The Da Vinci Code](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385504209/bizkiffer-20) by Dan Brown is an amazing book...





... when you start the first page you will hardly manage to stop reading. With each page you will be a little closer to the truth and want to find out more, have more answers and more question and learned more things about secret cults and societies. The characters are laid out marvelously and the plot twists and turns. I can without a doubt put this one on the same level as Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon and can only suggest it to anyone, especially if you are just a tiny bit interested in church, opus dei, secret society, art, code breaking, history, ... there is so much in there you can't put it down in one page. 

Wondering what I should write about this without giving it away, I will just stop and tell you to buy the book. Happy reading.
