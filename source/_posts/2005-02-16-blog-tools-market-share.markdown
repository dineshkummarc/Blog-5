Loic has [posted](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2005/02/weblog_tools_ma.html) a nice statistic on the market share of different blogging tools. It's based on [this analysis](http://www.elise.com/web/a/weblog_tools_market_update_february_2005.php) and brings in Six Apart as the leader in blogging based on market share.

&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.thylmann.net/images/_web_images_google-share-02-05-tm.jpg&quot; height=&quot;222&quot; width=&quot;333&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; hspace=&quot;4&quot; vspace=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot; Web Images Google-Share-02-05-Tm&quot; /&gt;

While Six Apart is already in the lead, thanks to LiveJournal really, Loic points out that there are some blogging platforms that are really powered by Six Apart technology and are getting really big. He cites a french blogging platform and I'd say About.com is not to be neglected if you look at raw impressions. Of course, the acquisition of LiveJournal really helped Six Apart out here but TypePad is surprisingly (for me) big in relation to LiveJournal, probably having to do with the fact that the TypePad users are a lot more active in aggregate. And a good thing to point out here is that a large part of TypePad blogs are really password protected and not visible from the outside, just catering to a small group of friends or family. All in all, congratulations to Six Apart though. Very nice.
