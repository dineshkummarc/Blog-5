The Cologne is grinding to a halt. He will arrive at the airport at 12:00 and starting 14:00 several bridges are closed off for pedestrians! Of course, cars also cannot pass. This includes 4 &quot;standard&quot; bridges and two that are either highway bridges or are leading directly on the highway!!! At 16:30, the Pope will address the crowd at the Poller Wiesen, go to the dome (he is arriving by boat) and then drive through the city in his Papamobil from the Dom to his Residence ... through the city!
&lt;/p&gt;
