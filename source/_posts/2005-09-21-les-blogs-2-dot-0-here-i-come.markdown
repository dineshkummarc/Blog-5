Loic [posted about it](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2005/09/les_blogs_20_in.html) and I can't help myself. Not having been there last time (last MBA exam, so a good excuse :)), I needed to be there this time. The registration has been sent out and I am looking forward to a great conference. It's two days with lunch and a good cocktail reception on monday.

The venue doesn't seem to be clear yet, so I'll wait for the hotel. Maybe we can organize a blogger hotel somewhere near so we don't all have to split up.
