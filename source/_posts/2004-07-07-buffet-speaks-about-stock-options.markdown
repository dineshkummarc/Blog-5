Oldman just [posted an article](http://oldman1787.blogspot.com/2004/07/columnist-watch-buffet-speaks.html) in which Warren Buffet rips to shreads what is currently being thought about expensing options. Attention, this is not about generally expensing them but about first of all only expensing those of the higher executives and presuming at the same time that your stock price is non-volatile. You can read the article [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A29807-2004Jul5.html) or on Oldman's Blog linked above.
