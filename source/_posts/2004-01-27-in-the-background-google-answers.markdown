&lt;p&gt;Why the hell is &lt;a title=&quot;Google Answers&quot; href=&quot;http://answers.google.com/answers/&quot;&gt;Google Answers&lt;/a&gt; not pushed more by Google? For those not in the know, Google Answers allows you to ask a question in case you do not find anything about it and then get it answered (potentially) for a small fee by a Google Researcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an amazing service and it seems to be logging about hundred questions a day, which might be the answer already. This just doesn't pay millions of EURs. Even at an Average of 10 EURs per question, this would only bring in 30.000 EURs per month, which is just not enough. Still, the content that they are creating can have an amazing value. So I am wondering if this will be brought out more into the open at the Google IPO. There might be something very valuable in there at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have my Google Researcher ID to answer questions there but I have to admit that the people that they have online are just too good for me and the questions too complicated. You have to be really good at finding things and I mean really good. I think I answered three questions, getting my fare share of the fee. But after that it took too much time to monitor new questions. Still. I maintain what I always said, Google Answers is a great service and Google should push it a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
