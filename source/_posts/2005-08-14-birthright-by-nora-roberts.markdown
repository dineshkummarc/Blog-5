I actually don't want to say too much about this book as it will give some things away. Again something nice and easy for the holiday, nothing too special and as the last two books actually bought by Avonia and as I happened to by out of books ... It's a very nice read though, with a good plot or rather mix of plots. [Check it out!](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0515137111/)
&lt;/p&gt;
