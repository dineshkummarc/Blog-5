Interesting thoughts on BusinessPundit about the potential to have a real open strategy. What if you blogged what you decided and will do quasi-live? I am not sure it works in start-up life but for bigger companies it might be a valid option in terms of marketing, branding and having a voice. Let's say you don't blog everything but you could simply talk at will and stop worrying about spilling secrets. This actually fits with Ricardo Semler's views in Seven Day Weekend. Everyone knows the books and they might go to customers showing them their margins from time to time. I mean what's somebody to do? If you are adding value, really adding value, then your numbers should be justifiable and if you are good at what you do, and possibly better than somebody else, then knowing that will not really help them in doing it themselves. At least worth thinking about.
