&lt;a title=&quot;Joi Ito's Moblogging, Blogmapping and Moblogmapping related resources as of 2/3/2003 18:00&quot; href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0114939/outlines/moblog.html&quot;&gt;Joi Ito's Moblogging, Blogmapping and Moblogmapping related resources&lt;/a&gt; seem to be a good spot to get more information on mobile blogging. I can post with my Tungsten but simply sending a mail or even an MMS would be much preferable. Seems like I really need to get qmail or something installed on this box so this works well. Keeping you posted.
