Thanks to [Jeremy's post](http://www.ensight.org/archives/2004/08/11/woot-rocks/) I just found [Woot!](http://www.woot.com/). What they do is sell one item per day, nothing more, nothing less. It's sold out at the end of the day and it's damn cheap. Of course, it's only available in the USA... oh how wonderful that I am in Germany. Grr...
