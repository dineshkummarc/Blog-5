The source of a spam-bot/worm is out ([german article](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/46634)) and virus people are already shivering. The thing is that this tool can do practically everything, from extracting Registration-Keys from Games or run on IRC-Networks. It'll be interesting to see what comes out of this. I really would like to see Google's ideas against this type of thing, meaning simply clicking arround in AdSense.
