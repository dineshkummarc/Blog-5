I think it's time to make a reunion from my school days. I have just been contacted by an old friend from school whom I knew to be in spain but just now I learned that he has started a company which organises Golf Trips to their region. They have 3 houses, as it looks like, which are directly on the side of some golf courses there. It is so interesting to learn what friends you have no spoken to in several years are up to all of the sudden.

On a side note, doesn't the internet make for an amazing holiday planning system? I mean I am starting to know people where I could sleep almost all over the world and the network is growing. Ahhh...

Good day.
