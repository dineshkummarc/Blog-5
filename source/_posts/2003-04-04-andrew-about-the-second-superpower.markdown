Andrew Orlowski of The Register has written a very interesting and as always smile provoking &lt;a title=&quot;The Register&quot; href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/30087.html&quot;&gt;article. This time it's about the new famous term of a &quot;Second Superpower&quot; and how it went from meaning something like world opinion to something totally different in just a matter of days.
