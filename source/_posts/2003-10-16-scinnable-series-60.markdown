Now if this is not cool. [3GLAB](http://www.3glab.com/) is showing off [Trigenix](http://www.trigenix.com/) to allow you to fully customize the Series 60 GUI. This can turn out to be really fun. They are actually working [together with T-Mobile](http://www.trigenix.com/pressroom/pr39.html) on this one now. Watch [a demo here](http://www.trigenix.com/products/demos/trigenix.html) or [here for the 7650](http://www.trigenix.com/flash/Trigenix.swf) if you don't want to register, but I don't know how old that one is.
