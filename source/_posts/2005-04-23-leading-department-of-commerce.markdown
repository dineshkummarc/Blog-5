Now how cool is that? Jeremy picked me as a possible lead for the Department of Commerce for a Blogger cabinet and that roughly the same time I put him on my Skype list (we got introduced to each other via our blogs some time ago). Check it out: &lt;a title=&quot;Ensight - Jeremy Wright ï¿½ Blogosphere Heads of State&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ensight.org/archives/2005/04/23/blogosphere-heads-of-state/&quot;&gt;Blogosphere Heads of State.

Thanks Jeremy.
