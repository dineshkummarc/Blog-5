What will be the future of social networks, excluding Facebook of course ;)? One idea that is really starting to grow on my is what [Ning](http://ning.com/) is enabling with their platform. Small niche social networks. The interface to integrate your view on all the networks you joined isn't fully there yet, but hey, this seems to be taking of just now. There are hundreds if not thousands of network on the platform and some are really getting traction.

The social network to note here is really [ad:bree](http://adbree.com/) from the wonderful guys and girls of [alarm:clock](http://thealarmclock.com/). The network was set-up to help people in the online advertising space to connect and have one network where the focus is clearly on advertising. With the market thriving as it is, this is a really good suggestion and there are already some very interesting players on the network. Above that I also added some people from totally different fields, like quality assurance and bloggers.
