This is the kind of title that you will get (in German) when you go to [dba.de](http://www.dba.de/). That is if you don't have JavaScript enabled, get a JavaScript alert (because it redirects to another domain) that you don't agree too or just have fast eyes. Otherwise you will be redirected to Flydba.de, the main site of DBA, a german cheap airline. For all those that get redirected (also on the flydba.de mainpage by the way ;)), here is what you would otherwise see, or a part of it:

&lt;img src=&quot;http://thylmann.net/img/flydba.png&quot;&gt;

This is so amazingly clear search engine spam and it's even badly done search engine spam!!! I mean they are using JavaScript to redirect to the real site. They could redirect based on user agent in the backend if they wanted to, which would be a lot less transparent to the average Joe out there. While this clearly is search engine spam I might even overlook this if it were done well because they are helping me find good stuff but ... a) this is Google's job to give me the right stuff and b) I hate having stupid words in my Google search and c) boy is that bad branding and d) it's technologically and logically badly done!

I wouldn't have expected that from somebody as big as DBA but they probably have just been tricked. I hope.
