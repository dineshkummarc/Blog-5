&lt;a title=&quot;Cooperating Systems, Inc.&quot; href=&quot;http://cooperatingsystems.com/&quot;&gt;Cooperating Systems, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; is developing HelloWorld. Yes, it seems like I have my day of &quot;Stuff on the Net&quot;. This is interesting though. It adds location to the equation of moving arround on the net, which is a good thing. I registered to be notified when it's out. It looks beautiful, which is important. This might be a P2P system that goes the next step. Hopefully it will be less of a let down than ManyOne (I still think it's a great name though ;))
