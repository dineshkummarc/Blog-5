Very interesting [article on Clickz.com](http://www.clickz.com/search/results/article.php/3080161) about how MS can beat Google in the search engine market. As a very rough and short summary, there is only one option. The thing is that Google is the &quot;best search engine&quot; in the mind of the user and whoever is first in the mind is what matters. This is now in the mind and you can't easily get it out. What MS has to do is be the &quot;next search engine&quot;. They need to build their marketing strategy so that Google sounds yesterday. Interesting idea. I am looking forward to seeing the next article about how Google can protect themselves.
