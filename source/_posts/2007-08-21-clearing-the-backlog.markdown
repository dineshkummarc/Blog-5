A kid sure occupies you. A friend likened it to watching fire recently. Really not too interesting but you just have to keep watching. I obviously didn't stop reading though so it is time for clearing the backlog again, dumping my brain into this blog once again, trying to get back on top of things.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The wonderful people at MOO have launched their [MOO Stickers](http://www.moo.com/products/stickers.php).Â  I already love their business cards, and this ads to the mix. Looking forward to seeing the company grow into other markets.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The guys at Townster posted [about Vibe on their Blog](http://blog.townster.de/2007/07/20/vibe-wir-brauchen-mehr-vibe/). Great little video!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;AOL/Time Warner bought TACODA in another deal which moves a network for ads further towards the big players, giving behavioural targeting a further push into the main stream.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Seth Goldstein launched [SocialMedia](http://www.socialmedia.com/), which builds Facebook aps, already having over 12 Million Users in total!!! They are looking for a designer by the way. If you know anyone, send me an eMail or leave a comment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As for ad networks, check out this article on media week entitled: [Marketers Turn to Web Ad Nets](http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/interactive/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003614929). Also a real relevant point for all the people out there running performance based advertising solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don Dodge [wrote about the Microsoft analyst meeting](http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/2007/07/advertising-sof.html) with some interesting bits. They are serious about advertising, having bought AQuantive and AdECN, having deals with Facebook and Digg. The other big pushes from Redmond are software as a service and consumer services. Big changes going on at Microsoft.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;[Clickriver](https://clickriver.com/advertiser/login/home;jsessionid=C472116E6A25B9B3D399B613CB1673AC?$g6K+l7Nd0uH+aBQ0LWjs6yq/CfzfludW) is online, allowing your to advertise your services on Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Amazon has started to allow [payable AMIs](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2007/07/start-filling-u.html) on their Amazon EC2 service. I have the feeling that [WeoCEO](http://weoceo.weogeo.com/) might be one of them soon.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Valleywag posted the [Facebook Ratecard](http://valleywag.com/tech/online-advertising/facebooks-secret-rate-card-284029.php).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The NU2M portfolio seems to be transferred to Media Ventures by the [looks of it](http://mediaventures.de/index.php?id=mv-portfolio). Watch out for some posters near you in Germany :)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Desktop Tower Defense is [coming to the desktop as a mutiplayer game](http://macapper.com/2007/08/08/multiplayer-desktop-tower-defense-your-favorite-new-timewaster/). God the time we will loose!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;F5 Networks bought [Acopia](http://www.acopia.com/). A good move if you ask me. They move from traffic management to a more integrated system of managing your entire server system.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Google is [tracking deeper data with AdSense](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/online-ad-serving-tests.html), allowing them to target users specifically based on their habits. With their reach, it's an amazing behavioural targeting system.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Plentyoffish.com is sticking with no employees for a while with big changes in the online dating market happening it [seems](http://plentyoffish.wordpress.com/2007/08/13/no-employees-for-a-while/).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Feld [posts about the Social Graph](http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2007/08/social_graph_th.html). One of our employees is working on something to allow social graph portability and Brad, ex LiveJournal / Six Apart, now Google, seems to be [going in that direction too](http://bradfitz.com/social-graph-problem/). This will seriously be a major shift and let's see if it happens or rather when.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
