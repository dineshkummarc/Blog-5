Just finished Life Is So Good by George Dawson and Richard Glaubman. George Dawson is now 102 and learned to read at the age of 98. He now lived in 3 centuries and the book is full of amazing stories. His grand parents were slaves and he worked hard all his life.

There are lots of interesting stories in there like a friend of him being hanged because a white girl thought it was safer to say she was raped by a black man than admitting to having sex with a white guy before marriage and being pragnant from him. Nobody said anything when the child was white. Dawson traveling up to Canada and Mexico, wondering why there are no drinking fountains for black people and never fully knowing what to make of the fact that white and black people just ate together in the same restaurant. Paying railway tickets whenever he could but also riding the rails by jumping on a train and almost getting shot one time. Working on building dams for years without a brake and still paying double for a mule because the owner was sick and old and he thought it was the right thing to do.

The emphasis is really strongly on the fact that there is no poor work, just work poorly paid and poorly done. A great book with lots of perspectives that shows you how good you are off and how humble you can be in the worst of times.

He now fills the class room learning to read because other people who were a lot younger said that if he can do it at his age then they can too.

Great book to read I can only suggest.
