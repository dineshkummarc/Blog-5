Thanks to [this post](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002932.html) by David Weinberger I now know that Dan Gillmor's book &lt;i&gt;We the Media&lt;/i&gt; is available [online as pdf](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/wemedia/book/) for free under the Creative Commons license. This is wonderful and I just downloaded the book. I will buy it in the next shop I see it in but the thing is that I am on the move and like this I already have something to read until the book is available here in Germany. It has already been put into HTML from the PDF form by the way, which you can find via David's post.
