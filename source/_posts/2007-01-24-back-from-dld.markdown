First of all, thanks a lot to Hubert Burda and of course to the entire team organizing the event. I had a great time, I was inspired and I will surely come again. The event was a great mix of people leading to very good networking indeed and some very inspirational talks, for example from Brian Cox about the [Large Hadron Collider](http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/) at Cern seen here showing us [the one formula that explains everything](http://flickr.com/photos/oliver/365697487/) :). And now I am stuck, because there are too many recollections, like [waterball at the party](http://youtube.com/watch?v=-V1RGUsNhfY), [Henning on the Segway](http://youtube.com/watch?v=hYt72LX-qnQ), loads of different people  including old and lots of new faces, a great panel on How to be Good, Where are the Editors, The Billion Dollar Bubble (with Marissa Mayer talking live about the [problem of the google.de domain from the night before](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/01/23/google-forgets-to-renew-googlede-site-goes-down/)) , and more. I really have to [agree with Martin that Arianna Huffington rocks](http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/general/arianna-huffington-rocks.html) and the panel with Tarik Krim from [NetVibes](http://netvibes.com), Craig Newmark from [Craigslist](http://craiglist.com) ([see Martin's video](http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/general/craigas-politics.html)), Jim Spanfeller from Forbes and David Sifry (see his [great photos from DLD](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dsifry/sets/72157594492892929/). He's a prime lens freak by the way, which I learned at the party :)) from [Technorati](http://technorati.com) was very good indeed. Because mentioning NetVibes, I have to also say that meeting Christoph from [Pageflakes](http://pagesflakes.com/) (and finally talking to him a bit longer after having seen him at MediaTech and Le Web :)) as well as a new colleague that will become official on Monday, was great.  But that's it from me and it's back to working on [Ormigo](http://ormigo.com/) and writing down all the great feedback we received.

You can watch many of the panels [here](http://videos.dld-conference.com/). Check out [Arianna's post about DLD](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/new-media-in-old-europe_b_39318.html) or simply follow [DLD at Technorati](http://technorati.com/search/dld).
