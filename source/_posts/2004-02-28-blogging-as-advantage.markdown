[Loic](http://www.u-blog.net/loic/) posted about a nice article from John Battelle about [blogging being a potential advantage in your job](http://www.u-blog.net/loic/note/57243). Sadly I can't read the entire article because it is subscription only and I don't qualify for the Business 2.0 US subscription which is at a good price actually. The European version is just too expensive. 

Anyway, back to the article. What John is actually talking about it seems, from the short excerpt that Loic has posted, is the interplay of blogs and rss or syndication in general. I'd probably argue that syndication can already change your reading habbit quite a bit and it allows for it to change even more extensively as you can read lots of individual web sites. Knowledge within the individual is huge but is hard to share and this has changed now. With the people I got into blogging and/or rss they all had to say that they were amazed at how much information was at their finger tipps, how much they could be reading, learning, sharing.
