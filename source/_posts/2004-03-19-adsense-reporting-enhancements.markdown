Google has just put live a few enhancements to their [AdSense](http://www.google.com/adsense/) interface ([found via the Search Engine Roundtable Weblog](http://www.seroundtable.com/archives/000237.html)). There are lots of funny little things available now, like the ability to create channels. I would split up this blog and the [OUBS Blog](http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/) for example. You can also choose a fill color to be used when Google would otherwise run a PSA ad, which is actually good for Google also because it works against ad-blindness. Some interesting new things there, check them out.

&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; It seems to be taking a day or two until the full channel reports are available. Then it really starts to get interesting though. A month of data and boy the knowledge :)
