I just got this from the TMF Boards. As they are only for paying members, I'll paste this here instead of linking to it.

&lt;I&gt;True Story At Denver Airport 

A crowded United Airlines flight was canceled. A single agent was 
re booking a long line of inconvenienced travelers. Suddenly an angry 
passenger pushed his way to the desk. He slapped his ticket on the counter and said &quot;I HAVE to be on this flight and it has to be FIRST CLASS.&quot; The agent replied, &quot;I am sorry, sir. I'll be happy to try to help you, but I've got to help these folks first, and I'm sure we'll be able to work something out.&quot; 

The passenger was unimpressed. He asked loudly, so that the passengers 
behind him could hear, &quot;DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO I, AM&quot; Without hesitating, the agent smiled and grabbed her public address microphone, &quot;May I have your attention please, &quot; she began, her voice heard clearly throughout the terminal. &quot;We have a passenger here at Gate 14 WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHO HE IS. If anyone can help him find his identity, please come to Gate 14.&quot; 

With the folks behind him in line laughing hysterically, the man glared at the United agent, gritted his teeth and swore &quot;F*** You!&quot;. Without flinching, she smiled and said, &quot;I'm sorry, sir, but you'll have to get in line for that too.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;
