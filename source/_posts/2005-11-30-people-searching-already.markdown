We haven't really announced our company yet, and already people searched for the company on [OpenBC](http://www.openbc.com/). I got somebody on my profile from [Quotatis](http://www.quotatis.com/) via a search for &quot;Ormigo&quot;, the name of the new company. Quotatis is a french site that allows individuals to get offers from 3 different merchants on a given subject allowing you to choose the best one. Congratulations for the [2 Million in funding](http://www.pme.gouv.fr/mde/e_tic/tic3/quotatis.html). Also, [Henning](http://www.henninglange.com/) got called already by another entrepreneur to ask what we are doing based on his blog post. (Update: 2 people ;))

Ormigo is the name of our company we are currently setting up by the way, but you probably have guessed that already.

(Update: That person seems to have searched for some subjects, probably dropped by one of Henning's posts, then searched on OpenBC, found the company name, ... :))
