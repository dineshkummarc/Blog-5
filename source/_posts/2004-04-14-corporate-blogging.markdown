Marketing Profs has an interesting article entitled [10 Rules for Corporate Blogs and Wikis](http://www.marketingprofs.com/4/wreden5.asp). It's good to read that from a marketing perspective, not a &quot;I am a blogger and I know&quot; perspective. A good link in there goes to Groove Networks who have a [Weblog Policy](http://www.groove.net/default.cfm?pagename=WeblogPolicy) and [a list of blogs from their employees and partners](http://www.groove.net/default.cfm?pagename=Blogs). Very nice move I have to say and a good policy.
