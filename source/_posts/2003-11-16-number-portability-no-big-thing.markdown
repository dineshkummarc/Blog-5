[Heise is reporting](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/adb-16.11.03-000/) that based on another paper, only a few customers take their number with them when they change wireless carriers here in Germany. The thing is that millions are switching carriers each year but only a few thousand are really taking their numbers with them too. Maybe all the fuss about number portability shouldn't be hyped so much.
