Then I really went more into Snapshots and got a Canon Ixus, but in recent months I was starting to want to get deeper into photography again, and the Canon just didn't have the right colors and clarity that I expected for half-professional digital images. The image in this post was done with my new Olympus C-8080 Wide Zoom, a camera that I have [seen first from Heiko](http://www.hebig.com/archives/002002.shtml#002002) and later got suggested (among others) by [Thijs](http://www.taospace.com/). Thijs knows me and had the valid point that a real SLR camera with exchangable lenses would have resulted in me getting more and more lenses, which isn't really needed. ;) Then I found [this review](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/olympusc8080wz/) of the camera and things started to get settled. With the great reductions in price via Amazon, the decision was taken and after my birthday two days ago, I am now back where I started, with Olympus.

I have to say that the camera is great. There are a zillion functions that I still have to get a grip off but the usability is very nice, at least if you start to grasp the concept behind it. The next thing will be to look arround for some place to host images. I could do it on my own server but I do still need some good way to make albums, make them password protected or not. I'll see how it goes. This marks the start of a photography category in this blog.
