T-Mobile, my mobile phone provider and sister company of Deutsche Telekom, launched a new service named &quot;Happy Digits&quot; with which you can gain points for money spent with your mobile phone. Cool service as such but the real clue comes in the rules.

You need to have a so called &quot;Buchungs Konto Nummer&quot; which is your account number for your _fixed line_ phone! So people can only use Happy Digits if they use Deutsche Telekom as their fixed line provider :) LOL. That removes me from that list as I am using a competitor for my fixed line. LOL 

Not bad I have to say. Not that it will make me switch, but it is nice to see that DT tries to tie their companies together ;)
