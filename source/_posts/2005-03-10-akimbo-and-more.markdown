So I just read the last post on [Video  on the Internet](http://thenewnormal.com/index.php/newnormal/video_on_the_internet_part_iii_akimbo/) on New normal. You should also read [part ii](http://thenewnormal.com/index.php/newnormal/video_on_the_internet_part_ii/) and [part i](http://thenewnormal.com/index.php/newnormal/video_on_the_internet_part_i/), including some very interesting comments. I particularly liked the last bit: 

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://thenewnormal.com/index.php/newnormal/video_on_the_internet_part_iii_akimbo/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akimbo intends to support all video content on the web.  By this I think they mean all â€œlegitimateâ€? content, but time will tell.  Using MyAkimbo, customers can trigger a download to the Akimbo box from a URL.  One effect of this is to enable blogs to send video files that can be viewed on a TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ok, I might not think this is too well put and actually has not the least bit to do with blogs, but a whole lot with Bookmarklets and RSS. MyAkimbo or whatever service there is could be subscribed to an RSS feed of shows and on top of that it could also give me a bookmarklet for downloading videos. I just read about a show, highlight the title and producer or something else, press the bookmarketlet, and this gets sent to my box at home which will do a search on Bittorrent and start the download while I am at work or on the go. Lots of nice ideas that can spring up there. 

It's good to be back blogging ;)
