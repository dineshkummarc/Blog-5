I have my Diploma in Management. Yesterday the letter arrived telling me about my result. Today a box arrived, bringing me my MBA Study Material. First course is Strategy and I still have to take a closer look but the OUBS once again managed to ship a nice bag with the entire package. Yes, I have a bag fetisch... wait ... not sexual or anything, simply a love for different bags. Anyway, back to the subject. The material looks great. It contains 11 OU Books (actually three books with 4/4/3 books in them), plus two standard books on strategy. Then there are two 90 minute videos and 3 Audio CDs. Then there is some stuff for the case study, residential school and a synopsis of the books which nobody should be forced to look at at first sight of their material. The synopsis shows you how much stuff there really is to learn. This will be a great amount of fun and I am looking forward to the studies by May.
