The new [Metallica](http://www.metallica.com/) Album is out, shot to number 1 of the charts at once and I just listened to the first song. No matter if you like metallica or not, they are one of the long-out-there bands that can be followed for pure interest. What will they do next? Where do they move? And emmm... we are back in heavy metal land! Well, it's a little cleaner and better produced and those among you that wanted them to go heavy again, that found Load too soft might be happy here. I think I need to listen further to this one. Other music of interest at the moment though would be Llorca, Norah Jones, Ryksopp and Craig David. Plus a million of different things obviously. Somebody asked me if I want to go to an LTJ Bukem concert this weekend but I have to say that I am not too excited which is why I will likely decline.
