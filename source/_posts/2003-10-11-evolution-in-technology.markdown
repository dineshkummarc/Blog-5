Nice reading [this](http://www.cio.com/archive/092203/borowitz.html):

*Our sense of direction now thoroughly degraded, we find tasks that used to be simple, like grocery shopping, well-nigh impossible without the assistance of yet another ubiquitous electronic device, the cell phone. Walk into a suburban supermarket and you'll see a number of lost-looking husbands, their own navigational systems shot to hell by their reliance on GPS technology. [...]

We may be stupider than our inventions, but we're better built, and for a simple reason: We didn't build ourselves. The average American has a life expectancy of 75 years, while the average VCR breaks after six weeks.

As he says, time is on our side ;)
