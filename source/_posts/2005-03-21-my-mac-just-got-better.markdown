&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it's the small things that change the way you are working and there are two apps that I downloaded and installed that just changed the way I am working with my mac and I do love it. One is [SizzlingKeys](http://www.yellowmug.com/sk4it/) by Yellow Mug Software, allowing me to easily control iTunes without always having to get the window to the front. A few keys and iTunes stops, starts, skips or simply goes a little bit louder. The other is [Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/) which means I hit two keys, type Cam... hit enter and Camino starts. And all that works with any app on your mac and a lot more stuff. My Dock just got cleared fully and I am only using Quicksilver to start things. Oh, and [Azureus](http://azureus.sourceforge.net/) is a great Bittorrent application in Java!&lt;/p&gt;
