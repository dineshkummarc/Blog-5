Now this might be a very good gift. [Customized Classics](http://www.customizedclassics.com/) allows you to order a book of let's say Sherlock Holmes, and replace every occurance of Sherlock Holmes with Oliver Thylmann, including the title. I could be [Ahab](http://www.customizedclassics.com/moby.asp)!!! :) Check out [The memoires of Joi Ito](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/11/26/the_memoirs_of_joi_ito.html) :)
