As [Jeremy pointed out](http://www.ensight.org/archives/2004/08/17/google-ipo-to-price-low/), word on the street is that the Google shares will likely start trading below the $108 minimum bid that was set for the auction at first. [CBS Marketwatch is also reporting](http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B6F6DE20F-C563-4AE7-8705-B717177B0449%7D&amp;siteid=google&amp;dist=google) that there are just too few bidders, at least at the higher prices. If they get in at something like $20, then I would start to be thinking about investing really. Maybe even $30. I'd have to redo [my own Google valuation](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/05/my_own_google_v.html) which was done before they announced the share numbers. But my valuation in the first item was correct and came out at roughly $100 per share. So if we take $140 there, therefore adding 40% to my other prices, a valuation I would be comfortable with would be about $30. Of course being in Germany, I can't really invest until after the IPO.

&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: The google debut on the stock market is [delayed](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3575022.stm) it seems. SEC authorization is not there yet.

&lt;b&gt;Update 2&lt;/b&gt;: Trading will start between $85 and $95 accounting to [this BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3575680.stm) and on top of that selling shareholders will only sell about 5 million instead of 11 million shares. It actually bothers me a great deal that part of the IPO is based on shareholders selling shares instead of the company anyway. At 5 Million shares and $100 per share, that puts something like $500 million (a bit less if you take out fees and such) directly into the pockets of big VCs and the founders, to name a few. &quot;Don't do bad.&quot; could be true here, as this is really not bad deal for them. I am starting to wonder if the &quot;Don't do bad.&quot; doesn't apply for shareholders of the company.

&lt;b&gt;Update 3&lt;/b&gt;: Authorization by the SEC is out. [GOOG](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GOOG) listed. They could be starting to trade today.
