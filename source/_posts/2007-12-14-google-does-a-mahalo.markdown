Jason Calcanis must be happy. Google just validated his entire business model with [this post](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/12/encouraging-people-to-contribute.html). What Jason talked about at le web 3 is that we need to work together to get the spam out of the internet and work together to do that. It is obviously directly linked with his editor driven search engine [Mahalo](http://mahalo.com), but still a valid point. Now
his entire business model was kind of validated by Google moving into the exact same space, getting people to write special pages about a certain subject. The important thing behind it is that the author of the page is personally identifiable, meaning that that person will have a hard time spamming. It will be interesting to see what the reaction of Jason will be to this.
