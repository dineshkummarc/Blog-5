I first read it via [Ross' post](http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2004/10/wikinews.html) and then I found [Joi's post](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/10/26/wikinews.html) about Wikinews which is currently being talked about. The idea is to do something like Wikipedia for News. As you see from both posts the verdict is still out if this is a good idea, or rather if they idea should be done by Wikimedia. I would really say that they should do it though. They do have the community capabilities and the is ripe. They will need and get other people that will do the postings anyway because it will be a different crowd. Hey, it's an experiment. In a sense, Wikimedia is nothing else than an infrastructure provider and they know how to keep this performing well if it goes big. Looking forward to seeing this happen.
