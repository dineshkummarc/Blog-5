I was just reading [Six Log](http://www.sixapart.com/log/) (the people behind this blogging software) and registered for the [TypePad](http://www.alistapart.com/stories/typepad/) announce list TypePad is their new hosted blogging solution that will likely come out soon. I am looking forward to seeing it and it might be a good thing, even though I am happy being able to play with MT on my own server.  While reading the blog I visited [The Web Standards Project](http://www.webstandards.org/) which is something that I think I will need to follow. Good move there.
