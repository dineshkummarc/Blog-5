Thanks to the new TypePad styles, I now have a new moblog which is no longer a TypePad photo album but a real blog. You can find it at [owt.typepad.com/moblog/](http://owt.typepad.com/moblog/) and it even has an RSS feed. Now that it's so much cleaner and better working I no longer have to decide where to moblog to, which means I will likely do it more often. That means I am not at three blogs really. This one, the [OUBS Blog](http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/) (summaries of my MBA studies) and my [Moblog](http://owt.typepad.com/moblog/). Another one is in the works but that takes some time :)
