The money starts coming in as it seems. Ross [just posted](http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2004/08/big_news.html) that Socialtext has received [Series A funding](http://www.socialtext.com/weblog/040823seriesa.html) from among others the [Omidyar Network](http://www.omidyar.net/) a new venture company by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, who also [blogged a bit about it](http://pierre.typepad.com/pierre/2004/08/what_ive_been_u.html). Other investors that should ring a bell are [Joi Ito](http://joi.ito.com/) and [Loic le Meur](http://www.loiclemeur.com/), but there are several more. They already have a great customer list but one I was particularly happy with was the use of Socialtext at the [Chaordic Initiatives](http://www.chaordicinitiatives.org/index.php), which is a movement/idea/something that has fascinated me ever since reading Dee Hock's book Birth of the Chaordic Age several years ago. I have been talking about it to people a lot. The main site of the idea [Chaord.org](http://www.chaord.org/) as a bit unaccessible though I found and the [Chaoric Initiatives](http://www.chaordicinitiatives.org/index.php) looks great! Thanks for working with them Ross!

The second funding round is reported by Om Malik [here](http://www.gigaom.com/2004/08/technorati_gets.php) ([source](http://business2.blogs.com/business2blog/2004/08/technorati_gets.html)) and is unconfirmed but looks right. It values Technorati at $12 Million which seems to be either amazingly high or amazingly low to me. I do think their largest competitor is [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/) and I am looking forward to seeing them funded.
