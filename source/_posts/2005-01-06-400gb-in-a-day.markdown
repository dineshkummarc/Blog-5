That's the amount of bandwidth that got used up by Waxy.org due to the posting of [Amateur Tsunami Video Footage](http://www.waxy.org/archive/2004/12/28/amateur_.shtml). The videos where then [transferred to Archive.org](http://www.archive.org/movies/movieslisting-browse.php?collection=opensource_movies&amp;cat=tsunami) who cumbled under the load. They are now back working. Congratulations to whoever gets the mony for the bandwidth costs ;)
