... not yet, but soon. September 22nd is the release date for their new album and I am looking forward to it already. This will be amazing. I am just not sure if they will go further in their experimentalism than in stain or if they move to a more mellow tone. To keep updated, check out [LivingColourNet.com](http://www.livingcolournet.com/lcwhatsnew.html). I want them to come tour in Germany! Living Colour was my first concert ever, and I lost my right glass of my glasses because I thought I'd be safe where I was standing, until somebody landed on my head 5 seconds after LC burst on stage :)
