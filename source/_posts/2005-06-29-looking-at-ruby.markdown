I am currently looking at Ruby and Ruby on Rails for further web development and what I read so far looks very good. Check this post by the main Odeo developer: &lt;a title=&quot;Rails, how does it scale for larger projects&quot; href=&quot;http://www.anarchogeek.com/archives/000514.html&quot;&gt;Anarchogeek: Rails, how does it scale for larger projects&lt;/a&gt;.

I also talked with some friends who really like it and with the language now being 10 years old, it's starting to be mature or even is. I'd love to hear from other people out there who have worked with it, possibly coming from PHP. How was your learning curve or how do you think it will be?
