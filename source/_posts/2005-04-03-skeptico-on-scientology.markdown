Skeptico posted an article [Understanding Scientology](http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/03/understanding_s.html) which is simply a great read. The blog is a great read in general actually. 

Check this: *When they reach OT III a great secret is told them. That is that they are full of the souls of space aliens murdered 75 million years ago and to achieve spiritual benefits they must pay to have them removed. The processing at this level costs $400 per hour. The whole of the Scientology religion is a continuous bait-and-switch fraud with the whole purpose of extracting the maximum amount of money from people.*

Fun indeed. :)
