Meet [Jeremy Zawodny](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/)! Ok, Yahoo! Search Blogger might be too little info but [Jeremy desribes his new job very well himself](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/002808.html). Congratulations to the move Jeremy, and it sounds like a wonderful challenge, that can get you lots of interesting places. 

What I really like about it is that it's not a move to become corporate blogger. Sure, the blogging bit played a big role, but he can move a lot further beyond this and that's something that rocks. Yahoo! seems to really go the full way to get the most out of people, fitting them to their tasks based on their preferences. This one just shows that this is true at least in some cases.

Looking forward to reading a lot more great posts, more searchy or not.
