This is something that a celebrity can really use their blog for, and if only for that. Jamie Oliver posted a message saying that recent reports in english newspapers are [untrue](http://www.jamieoliver.com/diary/2004/07/11/untrue.php), giving journalists a place to find out the truth. Wonderful to see.
