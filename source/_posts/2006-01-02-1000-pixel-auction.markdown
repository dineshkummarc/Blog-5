So, the [Million Dollar Homepage](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/) is through and the last 1000 pixels are [up on eBay](http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=5652179487&amp;ssPageName=ADME:L:LCA:UK:31) and already cost $6300, with over 9 days left on the auction. I [wrote about it in October](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/10/the_million_dol.html) and the post already has well over 30 copy cats in the comments. None is working as well as the MDH though. Looking forward to see for how much the auction finishes. The MDH recently got over 1 million unique visitors within a 48 hour period.

**Update**: $21k. 9 Days to go ;)
