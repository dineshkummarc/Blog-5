The russian duo Tatu were invited to Jay Leno. They had strict rules. No tungue kissing (they are both girls) and no word about Irak. They came on stage with tight t-shirts with russian on it. Translated it read: &quot;To hell with war&quot; 'Nuff said ;) (rumors say the producer of the show is being fired ;))
