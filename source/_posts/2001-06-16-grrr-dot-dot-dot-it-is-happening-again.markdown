Once again I was woken up by:

&quot;Test. 1.2.3. Test. Test...&quot; today.

I went to club from 1am to 5:30 am yesterday and around the nice time of 10am the 3 student bands that are playing on the market today (in front of my window) started testing the sound system. at 12am the first band started and sleeping was no longer an option. What I really hate is the introduction from the singer (translated from german):

&quot;Good morning Aachen. If it is too loud for you, then go somewhere else.&quot;

Asshole! :)
