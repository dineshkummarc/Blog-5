Gizmodo posted a picture with [a note to torchbearers](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/samsungs-heart-swelling-olympic-reminder-015743.php) from Samsung for this years Olympics. In short, Samsung urges you to say that you thank them on your knees that due to them, you are allowed to carry the olympic flame. I really hope it is a joke. Otherwise, I agree with the last line in their comment: &lt;I&gt;Just makes you want to go out and buy a 46&quot; LCD TV screen from Samsung, inspired by their spirit of international athletic brotherhood, don't it?&lt;/I&gt;
