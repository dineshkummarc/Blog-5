Due to recent events, some discussions arround me have ended up on the topic of nuclear weapons. Today I was pointed to this [FAQ on Nuclear Weapons Physics and Design](http://gawain.membrane.com/hew/Nwfaq/Nfaq2.html). I haven't read it too carefully yet, but it seems to be very good and worth a read for everyone with an interest in the subject. I will read it when I somehow find some extra hours within my days ;)
