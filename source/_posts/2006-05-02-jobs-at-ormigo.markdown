Greetings everyone. I posted another update on the [Ormigo Blog](http://blog.ormigo.com/) about another job opening. First we were looking for [core developers](http://blog.thylmann.net/2006/03/ormigo_looking_.html), which was also posted on the old Ormigo site and has proven to have been quite successful. After our successful financing, we changed the site a bit so you can't find the original bit about developers anymore, other than on my own blog. At the moment, the [Ormigo Jobs Section](http://blog.ormigo.com/category/jobs/) has three open positions, all in German. One would be for a quality assurance professional, which I called Qualitizer (for Quality Optimizer) here. This can be a part-time, or freelancer, or whatever job really. This should really be a full time job but we are testing our feet to see what is out there first. There are lots of options for you to move in this post, and we are open for suggestions. The new job I just posted is for a Web Developer who will be responsible for our Front End, Corporate Identity and Usability initiative. We are looking for a young and fresh mind that wants to move things and has an eye for good web design and a drive for going deeper into the development part of it all.

The other job that is posted is an internship for a marketing, creative writer type of position. We want somebody that is good with words and wants to try out their skills in a fresh new start-up. Looking forward to hearing from you too.
