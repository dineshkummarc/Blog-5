That's what Mark Twain said if I remember correctly and now you can buy a bit of land for just $25 per area and help to build a park. The project can be found at &lt;a title=&quot;Tariona&quot; href=&quot;http://www.tariona.com/&quot;&gt;Tariona and first looked a bit similar to [Million Dollar Homepage](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com) but there are a few twists that make it a lot more worthwhile. First, the money goes into a kind of fund that pays for the cultivation of the land you buy. Second, you still get a link in a list to get your pagerank or whatever you want from it.

The intention is actually not to make the guy that started it money, but to really help preserve the wildlife. The site looks great but that was to be expected as it is done by a very fine designer. Looking forward to see this take off. The [location](http://www.tariona.com/where) already looks nice.
