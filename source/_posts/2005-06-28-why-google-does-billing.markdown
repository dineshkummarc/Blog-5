Google has already announced that they are doing a billing platform and today in the tram it made all the sense in the world as they really don't have to do a lot. They are already working together with [Bertelsmann Financial Services](http://www.bfs-finance.de/) for AdWords and AdSense and this thing can be easily extended. Just look at the [feature list](http://www.bfs-finance.de/?url=Billing+Solutions/Solutions&amp;lang=en) of what they can handle. Of course, Google will have to pay money to BFS to handle things but they can let them handle the credit risk, billing, and whatever else is involved and have a huge company to rely on. They are doing an amazing interface, something scalable and just aggregate payments handled via BFS if they want. Looking forward to seeing what they have developed in this partnership, if it goes that far.
