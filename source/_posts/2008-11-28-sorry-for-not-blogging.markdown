It's been over 2 months since my last post and this is inexcussable. But if you check the right side of this blog you will see some posts from [stuff.thylmann.net](http://stuff.thylmann.net) and [twitter.com/olivert](http://twitter.com/olivert) and [delicious.com/othylmann](http://delicious.com/othylmann) which are no deep thoughts, but might give you an overview of what I am reading and thinking about.

For the most part this thinking revolves around [Adcloud](http://adcloud.net/), a second project we just started at Ormigo which is currently generating a lot of buzz and is leading to some very interesting discussions. In very short terms, we are extracting the performance advertising ad server system from Ormigo and making it into it's own product, creating, through a few more features, an open performance advertising exchange.

Sounds a bit abstract for now, but I will try to get into it a bit more deeply as things go on. We are truely leveraging our experience with agile development to get new releases out quickly and are working very closely with our customers to get the right stuff in there first.

But these are busy times so please excuse me for a bit more lighter blogging at this time.
