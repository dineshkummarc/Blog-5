There is a nice post endtitled [No site should be hard to update](http://blog.jot.com/archives/2005/05/05/rojo-and-jotspot-no-site-should-be-hard-to-update/) on the JotBlog which shows how JotSpot and Rojo have worked together to build Rojo's Rojonetworks.com as a Wiki. This is not a Wiki as such but just a corporate site. The JotSpot wiki is just the backend of the system. Not too bad really. At least it's an interesting trial.
