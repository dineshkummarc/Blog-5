ChangeThis just published the new manifestos and one of them is from Tom Peters [100 Ways to Help You Succeed/Make Money, Part 1](http://www.changethis.com/14.100Ways). It's actually 50 tips from his blog or elsewhere that are put together in this wonderful 65 page document. You might agree or not agree with Tom, and he might have some too loyal following, too little freaks that challenge him, but first of all he has an amazing writing style, some wonderful ideas and hell, read point #39:

**Blog as if your life depended on it!**

He obviously sold me there. ;) But enough of the fun about it. Here are some other points from the material that particularly touched me.





I'll just make this a lit.


* Keep your desk/office/world clean.*
* &quot;*When you address the Client, never fail to use the word 'We.'* I really do think it does help to use We instaed of You or I a lot.
* Say Thank You!!! Here, handwritten notes beat eMail. Just put a post-it on somebody's pc or something. :) 
* Make the call that you don't want to make today, now.
* Motivate yourself first!
* To quote him in this question: *What (One Sentence) will Today's Legacy be ... for You?*
* If it is not &quot;wow&quot; then don't.
* Great quote I added to my list (see [thylmann.net](http://thylmann.net)): We often get in trouble for the stupid shit we do to avoid telling about the shit that happened because of the stupid shit we did.
* *&quot;Old&quot; Rules*. The thing is that Boomers are become 60 and Geezers will follow soon. Just imagine the money!
* Quote: *She or he who works hardest has one hell of an advantage.*
* GET THE HELL OUT OF YOUR CUBE (aka MBWA aka Management by Wandering Around)
* Micromanage your first and last impressions. Oh so true there. 
* What's the dream your going after? The one that makes me go wow?! Work on your story.
* When you do a speech, or simply when you work, try to somehow make it personal.
* He is again going on about design and I know Ingmar supports him 100% and I almost do too, mostly do too, I think I agree, Mainly, ... now I just need to think more about how to design this thing here. Grrr...
* He added a quote from Seth Godin: If you can't describe your position in eight words or less, you don't have a position.


And obviously, he is into blogging. All in all I suggest you read the piece because it is just wonderful to read and very insightful, much above the little list I have here.
