There's lots of discussion about Globalization here in Germany currently, mostly due to the G8 Meeting taking place here and due to the protests.

I would suggest all protesters take a look at Hans Rosling's Presentation from TED 2006. Especially interesting is the part starting [here](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2670820702819322251#6m15s).
