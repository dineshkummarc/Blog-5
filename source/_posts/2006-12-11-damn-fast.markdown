I just had a great pre-event meeting for [le web 3](http://leweb3.com), and am at the same time a bit sad that the network at novotel costs money, but it is god damn fast.

I just uploaded [several pictures](http://flickr.com/photos/oliver/tags/leweb3/) to [Flickr](http://flickr.com) in a matter of seconds. Very cool.

Looking forward to meeting some more great people tomorrow at the event!

See you there.
