If you thought selling shoes online doesn't work, then check out [Zappos.com](http://www.zappos.com/). SiliconBeat just posted a story that [Zappos.com makes it look easy](http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2005/02/03/zapposcom_makes_it_look_easy.html) which is true indeed. Just check out their latest revenue numbers:

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2005/02/03/zapposcom_makes_it_look_easy.html&quot;&gt;1999: Almost nothing
2000: $ 1.6 mm
2001: $ 8.6 mm
2002: $ 32 mm
2003: $ 70 mm
2004: $184 mm
2005: $300 mm (goal)

Not bad ey? And they went from 5 employees to 1000 by the end of the year. Boy oh boy. Not bad. So much for selling shoes, and now handbags, online. Congratulations.
