&lt;p&gt;If you thought selling shoes online doesn't work, then check out [Zappos.com](http://www.zappos.com/). SiliconBeat just posted a story that [Zappos.com makes it look easy](http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2005/02/03/zapposcom_makes_it_look_easy.html) which is true indeed. Just check out their latest revenue numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2005/02/03/zapposcom_makes_it_look_easy.html&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;1999: Almost nothing&lt;br /&gt;
2000: $ 1.6 mm&lt;br /&gt;
2001: $ 8.6 mm&lt;br /&gt;
2002: $ 32 mm&lt;br /&gt;
2003: $ 70 mm&lt;br /&gt;
2004: $184 mm&lt;br /&gt;
2005: $300 mm (goal)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not bad ey? And they went from 5 employees to 1000 by the end of the year. Boy oh boy. Not bad. So much for selling shoes, and now handbags, online. Congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;
