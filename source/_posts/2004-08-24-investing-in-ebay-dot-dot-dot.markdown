... is the only way to invest in PayPal and based on [this InternetRetailer.com news report](http://www.internetretailer.com/dailyNews.asp?id=12583) it seems that PayPay has rewritten their backend and now has a new API that allows them to offer their payment system to other merchants a lot more easily. The transaction price for bigger players (over $100.000 a month) pay only 1.9% plus 30 cents in fees. This feels like it is very little. I had this clipped in [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/) for some time and I even started reading the eBay report and will likely have to do so again. This sounds just too interesting and I am not sure if it is already on the radar, or should be, of the eBay Investors. If it isn't, then that's good.
