&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to look at this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-	When you understand why a person acting in a certain way, then you can better predict what they will do next.&lt;br /&gt;
-	To understand behaviour you need to understand the underlying social pressures.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The individual is in charge of what they do and what it means. â€œHumans are pro-active rather than reactive.â€? (Huczynski and Buchanan, 1991)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that events do not have one fixed meaning, but a number of different interpretations. This is why Eden starting using mental models in 1988.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we think someone is arrogant before a meeting, this will shape how we interpret what he or she does. -&gt; a vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behaviour shapes thinking which shapes interpretation of behaviour. In the end this means that people construct events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly said in 1991 that these constructs actually say nothing about that person but everything about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These mental models have a structure, aka, there are higher and lower values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-	individual values&lt;br /&gt;
-	professional or occupational values (code of ethics, value statement)&lt;br /&gt;
-	group / team values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshalling people, often with very disparate agendas to work towards the overarching goals of the organisation, is at the heard of the managers role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to values we are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-	aiming at achieving goals â€“ goal directed and purposeful&lt;br /&gt;
-	or (as is the purpose of a goal) need driven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huczynski and Buchanan also said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	â€œOur society or our culture influences our motives through the values, ideals, standards are modes of behaviour of other people.â€?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ï¿½	Behaviour might be seen as a reflection of a role that generates a set of expectations that we try to conform to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, what is â€œappropriateâ€? is out of our control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is partly right as regulating our behaviour is not only expected, it is absolutely necessary for life to run smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common mistakes that people do are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-	only consider objective facts&lt;br /&gt;
-	everyone works for the same goals / values&lt;br /&gt;
-	some behaviour does not make sense and can therefore be discounted
&lt;/p&gt;
