[This](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/33792.html) can be said to be part of this campaign too, in which Microsoft is trying desperately to bolster up their image. This time, they set up a $5 Million reward-fund to put bounties out on hackers or virus writers. The first ones are the Sobig and Blaster worms. Any information leading to their arrest can bring the informant $250.000. ... Now where do I find that damn person ;)
