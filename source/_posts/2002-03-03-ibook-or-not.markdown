Well, my laptop died, or the screen to be exact. So I am looking for a new one.

The problem here is that it brought back the iBook thinking.

I could get a Dell Latitude (or Inspiron, forgot) 4100 for 2100 EUR (1.0 ghz p3, 256mb, 20gig, network, modem, 14&quot;, XP Pro, Office XP) and this would be a wonderful system really. I have no doubt about it.

But I could get an iBook 600Mhz (100mhz bus speed), 12&quot; (more than happy with that), 256mb, 20gig, dvd/cd-rw, wavelan, networking, modem, OS X for about 2200 EUR.

Now there, the price is close. It bothers me that it has no IR port and no PCMCIA especially because I want bluetooth some time. I could use an USB-Bluetooth adapter though. 

The real problem comes in though when I think about software. I am used to the windows software I have and there its not really hard to get any of it even for free from friends or some other way.

For the Mac, I would have nothing and as it looks now, not much ability to get anything and I need Outlook for syncing the palm and future mobile phones for example so I would need office for OS X, also for Word for my studies. I just can't buy that though. I am already out there with the price of the laptop at the moment. So that is my major drawback at the moment. A major one. If the software issue would be settled then I think I would have to do some very serious thinking. Very serious.

I think I'll read up a bit on mac stuff now and do some further thinking. Hmmm... if anyone of you mac users want to give another personal account of wether you think its a good idea to have a windows desktop and apple laptop then shoot. But I think most of you already talked about it many times.
