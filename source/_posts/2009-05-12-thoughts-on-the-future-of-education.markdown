&lt;p&gt;Having just hired a few people again at [Ormigo](http://ormigo.com) / [Adcloud](http://adcloud.net), the following two videos connected very well with me. The thing is that education is often not the deciding factor. Passion is a lot more important. We actually have one guiding principle when choosing new employees:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hire and promote first on the basis of integrity; second, motivation; third, capacity; fourth, understanding; fifth, knowledge; and last and least, experience. Without integrity, motivation is dangerous; without motivation, capacity is impotent; without capacity, understanding is limited; without understanding, knowledge is meaningless; without knowledge, experience is blind. Experience is easy to provide and quickly put to good use by people with all the other qualities. - Dee Hock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very important thing here is motivation and with that comes passion. The people really need to love what they are doing and you those that do often have none-linear schooling. This is probably especially true for developers, which is obviously what I am hiring. What we need is a schooling system that finds out what a person's passion is and helps them find a job within that passion. This can be anything from rocket ship engineer to plumber. When you have a passion for something you will be very good at it and no outsourced &quot;worker&quot; will beat you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this here is the first video that you should be watching. It is old and I might have linked to it previously, but still, it serves as a good intro to the second one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/Mmz5qYbKsvM&amp;hl=de&amp;fs=1&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/Mmz5qYbKsvM&amp;hl=de&amp;fs=1&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then [watch Sir Ken Robinson give an introduction to his new Book The Element](http://www.thersa.org/events/vision/vision-videos/sir-ken-robinson-the-element):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;536&quot; height=&quot;420&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.i2ic.com/clientsarea/rsa/player2.swf?filename=lectures/Ken-Robinson-2&amp;filmed=February 2009&amp;posted=February 2009&amp;autoplay=false&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.i2ic.com/clientsarea/rsa/player2.swf?filename=lectures/Ken-Robinson-2&amp;filmed=February 2009&amp;posted=February 2009&amp;autoplay=false&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;536&quot; height=&quot;420&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need more thinkers like that, or actually we need Doers that follow those thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;
