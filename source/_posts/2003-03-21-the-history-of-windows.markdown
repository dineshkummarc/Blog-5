Neowin.net has a 16 page piece on the &lt;a title=&quot;Neowin.net - Where unprofessional journalism looks better - Microsoft Windows History - Page 1&quot; href=&quot;http://www.neowin.net/articles.php?action=more&amp;id=53&amp;perpage=1&amp;pagenum=1&quot;&gt;- Microsoft Windows History. Lots of screenshots. And while I am at it, I love the tag line of Neowin.net: &quot;Where unprofessional journalism looks better&quot;

That's what the Cluetrain Manifesto means with a real voice, really talking to your readers. I would extend that to simply telling the truth.
