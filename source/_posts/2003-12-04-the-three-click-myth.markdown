I just found an article on &lt;a title=&quot;Testing the Three-Click Rule&quot; href=&quot;http://www.uie.com/Articles/three_click_rule.htm&quot;&gt;Testing the Three-Click Rule&lt;/a&gt; via [Daniel Sch√§fer's post on it](http://www.danschaefer.de/index.php?p=136&amp;c=1). Very nice read of those of you that have already head somebody say in the relation to &quot;We need to make everything accessible with three clicks.&quot;

To quote the article: 

&lt;I&gt;In our studies, users complain about how long it takes to find things all the time. This is one way that users vocalize their frustration. They tell us that if they could only reduce the number of frustrating clicks the site would be better. 

However, these complaints aren't actually about the clicks. They are really complaints about failing to find something. When users find what they want they don't complain about number of clicks. &lt;/I&gt;
