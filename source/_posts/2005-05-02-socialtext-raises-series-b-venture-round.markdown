Ross just posted about [Socialtext raising Series B funding](http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2005/04/socialtext_rais.html). Congratulations are due to start with. In true Ross fashion he adds a little game to make all this more interesting. The first people to post about: 

- Who led the round  
- Total investment
- Participating firms
- A new Board Member
- On what odd day did it close?

... will get 5 year long seats for Socialtext. :)

He even adds a fun little line: &lt;I&gt;Our competitors could win as all that hard work has to pay off sometime and we want everyone to have better tools.&lt;/I&gt; ... sounds like a very tongue in check comment about some other Wiki company ;) Good one. Congratulations Ross.
