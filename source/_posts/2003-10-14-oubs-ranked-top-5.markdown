I was just sent [this link](http://www.link.msk.ru/english/mbatop5.htm) which gives a bit of detail on the OUBS being ranked fourth in the world in a new (4th of March 2003) survey on distant learning MBAs. Their tutor support, coupled with residential schools and online discussions is what was noted positively by the Financial Times, who did the ranking.

University of Phoenix won, then Heriot-Watt University and Henley Management College from the UK. Next, on place 4, is the OUBS.
