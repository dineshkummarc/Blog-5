Two days ago I [posted](http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000984.php) about six girls having launched an [auction on ebay](http://cgi.ebay.de/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=2961465280) where they give themselves away (plus some beer) for a party. By now, they are run over by the press, can't reply to the flood of e-mail anymore, have brought their hosting provider down, got a new one, and have the auction standing at over 12000 EUR!!! They didn't expect this to happen naturally but it once again shows the power of viral marketing if you want. Create something like this with a brand attached and you got it going. It's be interesting to see what comes of this.
