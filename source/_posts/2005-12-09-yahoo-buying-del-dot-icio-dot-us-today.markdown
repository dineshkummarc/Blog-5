Rumors [are coming](http://www.agenturblog.de/archives/2005/12/kauft-yahoo-delicious.php) in that Yahoo! will be buying del.icio.us today for $30-40 Million.

**Update:** [Check](http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/yahoo.html). One more cool service for Yahoo!.

**Update 2:** By now I already heard numbers lower than $30 million, going as low as $17 million, which would still be a good number.
