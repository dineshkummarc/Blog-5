Seems that Kim &quot;[Kimble](http://www.kimble.org/)&quot; Schmitz, is now going Money Printing. His newest venture [Trendax](http://www.trendax.com/), also known as &quot;The Money Making Machine&quot; is said to be a computer based system with artificial intelligence that will trade things on the stock market ... and he promises returns of 25 and up to 50% per year. 

People out there! Let me tell you one thing! This is not possible. Period. In case he would succeed then everyone would do it and by nature of statistics, everybody, including him, would be back at an average growth rate. It just doesn't work. 'nuff said.
