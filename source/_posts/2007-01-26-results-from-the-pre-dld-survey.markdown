I received the results from the pre DLD survey and I like them. First of all, not that many people took part (228) but it is still interesting and I am happy to know that I am party of the only 25% who also have been at DLD 06 :) Congratulations also to [Ibrahim](http://www.ibrahimevsan.de/) to having made the &quot;Other Leading Entrepreneurs of 2006&quot; list.

The good things for us at [Ormigo](https://ormigo.com/) is really the Important Topics for 2007 part. Obviously it starts with *user generated content*, going on with *communities, social networks*,Â  next up *online video content*, and then at place 4 *performance based marketing* with 79% saying it is very or somewhat important. This is of course wonderful to hear and something we very much believe in. Then there is the &quot;Best Business Model&quot; which in second place (36%) has providing a platform for customers' transactions which is again very close to what we do. Allowing local merchants to get new customers on a per lead (customer contact) basis, generated via ad campaigns that they could never run on their own, is really just a platform that facilitates transactions between merchants and users. This is really the mix of advertising, performance marketing, and a platform for transactions.

Well, we're looking forward to rocking 2007 then :)
