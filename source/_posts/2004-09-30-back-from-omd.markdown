I just returned from OMD (Online Marketing DÃ¼sseldorf), which great, insightful and filled with very productive meetings. Great people and a great event if you are doing anything in the field. I also met [Nico](http://www.lumma.de/) and had a great chat with him before and especially at the OMD-Party; Motto: [Online geht das](http://flickr.com/photos/oliver/629525/) (Online it works). You can see me smiling at him and raising a beer [here](http://nico.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=735). Lots more photos from the event can be found [here](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/omd2004/). Looking forward to next year.
