I couldn't keep myself. You should never have a meeting of geeks with macs without iSights. You'll end up buying them anyway. So I did. I am now got my [iSight](http://www.apple.com/isight/) (WORD PLAY WORD PLAY! ;)). If you are available on there, send me a message and we can chat :) My nick is othylmann.
