If you are curious what your browser can tell somebody else about you. [Check this](http://gemal.dk/browserspy/). [This](http://gemal.dk/browserspy/css.html) is scary for example, even though I knew it was possible, still scares me when I see it. And [Bandwidth Information](http://gemal.dk/browserspy/bandwidth.html) shows something way above Cable for me. :) In general though there is lots of stuff in there that can be quite handy from time to time.
