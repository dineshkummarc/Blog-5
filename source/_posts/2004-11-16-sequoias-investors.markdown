TJ pointed me in [his post](http://www.tjacobi.com/archives/sequoias_investors.html) to a list of investors of Sequoia. While there are obviously some funds and universities in there it also includes some people, who obviously have some money in their pockets. These include [Andy von Bechtolsheim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Bechtolsheim), [Wu-Fu Chen](http://www.cina.org/wufuchen.html), [Ed Kozel](http://www.fernuni-hagen.de/ICDE/final/themes/key_koz.htm) and [Ram Shriram](http://www.sherpalo.com/meet_ram.php). Nice list!
