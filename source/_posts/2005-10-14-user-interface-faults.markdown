So I recently bought tickets for a trip to Paris with the Thalys. Some interesting problems in the interface to see along the line there.

For example, here you can select your salutation: Herr (= Mr), Frau (= Miss), Fra&amp;uuml; ... ok, that last one simply does not exist but they must have tried to translate something:

But then again, they have some other translation problems. Some stuff just remains ...

Thank god for the arrow in front of this because I would never have known that this would be the link to continue :)
