Thijs bought an MP3 Player and he is happy with his buy, just not happy with the windows software coming with it. MusicMatch Jukebox has giving him nothing but &lt;a title=&quot;Frustration&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.taospace.com/2004/06/frustration.html&quot;&gt;Frustration. A fun read and I can feel his pain from having downloaded MM Jukebox once. It's not something I want to remember. ;)
