A new conglomerate is in the building at the moment. This is getting serious. Joi just [announced](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/09/26/im_investing_in_flickr_too.html) his investment into [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/). I presume [Loic](http://www.loiclemeur.com/) will be next. :) Then between them they will have close ties to Six Apart (ok, very close there ;)), Technorati, Linked In, Flickr, Creative Commons and Socialtext. .. I actually don't know what else there is but it's getting interesting. I somehow want a part in that ;)
