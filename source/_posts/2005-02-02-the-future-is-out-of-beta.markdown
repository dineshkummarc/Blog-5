&lt;p&gt;The future has arrived. [Skype](http://www.skype.com) is out of beta and for several platforms at that. Cool! Congratulations to the team at Skype. Now please give me the option to get several different phone numbers all over the world as my inbound phone number. 0skypeXXXXXXXX would be great if it worked everywhere in the world locally.&lt;/p&gt;
