It seems that [Google is testing a new look](http://google.blogspace.com/newgooglelook) (only some see it), at least for the results page. Seems to be largle an interface design move from my point of view. They are moving away from tabs, making it even more clearer, pushing the results up a bit the option to search for images and other thing down. Good idea. Interestingly enough, Google AdWords seem to be even more seperated now. It will be interesting to see how this goes.
