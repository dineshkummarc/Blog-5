&lt;p&gt;There we have it. [Typepad](http://www.typepad.com/) goes 1.5. The post about it is [here](https://www.typepad.com/resources/2004/11/rich_text_editi.html) which gives a bit of detail on the different new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;WYSIWYG Editor, which I am using now. This one is actually fairly nice but I am not a big fan of WYSIWYG Editors because it's not really true, simply because I have an idea about the HTML Code I'd like to see behind it ;) Being a Mac user at home, and with this not being supported in Safari, I will stick to lots of clean code.&lt;strong&gt; Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Looks like the code&amp;nbsp; looks really nice. I might be using this thing afterall. Now I want keyboard shortcuts :)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All us Typepaders now have a Spell Checker, so expect less spelling mistakes in this wide blogging world out there.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Quickpost also has the WYSIWYG Editor, which is a nice. It's probably the thing I use most to post to my blogs.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;under reported &lt;/em&gt;item: The file manager has been reworked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all a few nice additions and likely some cool changes in the background too, but the most striking thing is the file manager. This one now displays HTML and CSS files. What does that mean? You can put your entire web site on Typepad as long as you don't need PHP or MySQL or anything of that sort. But a friend of mine will publish a new book and this just makes Typepad a very nice host for the site about his book. Any extra pages can just be uploaded. Very good move there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this co-insides very nicely with the release of [Lifeblog 1.5](http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,1522,,00.html?orig=/lifeblog) by Nokia which [Christian blogged about](http://www.christianlindholm.com/christianlindholm/2004/11/lifeblog_15_is_.html). The [press release](http://www.nokia.com/aboutnokia/press/nmc2004/pressreleases/Nokia_Lifeblog.pdf) (pdf) stats that Lifeblog uses Atom to post things to Blog hosts like Typepad. All you really need is a compatible Atom posting interface I presume. This might really push new users into Typepad once the [Nokia 3230](http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,65362,00.html) comes out and gets Lifeblog enabled. This is one of the reasons why Typepad really needed this new WYSIWYG editor. Good to see it all fits together nicely. &lt;/p&gt;
