Sometimes surfing can be fun. I  went from [this post on TEDGlobal](http://marcellomedia.blogs.com/mrb/2005/07/tedglobal_.html) by marcel to the [TED](http://www.ted.com/) pages and looked at the speakers. Impressive stuff! Among them I found Ze Frank and his homepage: &lt;a title=&quot;ze's page&quot; href=&quot;http://www.zefrank.com/&quot;&gt;ze's page. Great stuff! Just listen to his take [on communication](http://www.zefrank.com/punc/).
