[Jeremy Zawodny's Linkblog](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/linkblog/) just pointed to [the  mod_log_sql 2.0 Documentation](http://www.outoforder.cc/projects/apache/mod_log_sql/docs-2.0/) and it's a very nice read. It seems to be performing rather well and is a likely good system to track a web site even up to a good size and handle some tricky queries towards that data. I'd like to see further load tests really in much higher loads, as to thousands of hits per second, which would make it very interesting in the long run. For now, it's on my list to tracking web site hits.
