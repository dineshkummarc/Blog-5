Heiko [pointed me](http://www.hebig.com/archives/002442.shtml) towards a forum post: [I found a digital camera.](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=144008&amp;st=0). Very creepy indeed. Check out the guy on the left of the picture from within the tower, in the mirror, or the creepy humans/robots/aliens in the fog in another. There is a guy somewhere between the woods somewhere too and there are eyes in one cave. This is very much Blair Witch Project, like Heiko points out correctly.
