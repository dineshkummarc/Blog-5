Wow, Andrew Baio has [put up the new opus comics](http://www.waxy.org/archive/2003/11/24/new_opus.shtml) on his site [right here](http://waxy.org/random/images/opus/). I loved those comics when they came out, and still do. Great to see somebody scans them so I can get to read them. And no worries, I will buy them in book form when they are out :)
