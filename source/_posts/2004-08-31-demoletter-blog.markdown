Heiko [alerted me](http://www.hebig.com/archives/002458.shtml) that DEMOletter, the newsletter for the DEMO conference, now has a blog right [here](http://www.demo.com/demoletter/) where you can follow all the greatest stuff happening around the conference and the companies attending or having attended it or technology space in general. Based on the current stories, this will be a very good read.
