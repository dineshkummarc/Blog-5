We can all say goodbye to Ublog, the french distributor/re-seller of Six Apart's wares in EMEA. They are no more. Congratulations to [Loic](http://www.loiclemeur.com/) for having been acquired by Six Apart! This is really wonderful news and I expected so much for a long time. Loic has some interesting company founding experience and is a great addition to their core team and I wish them, as I always have, the greatest of luck. Business always needs a bit of luck but this time things are on their side and I feel that this will be Loic's biggest venture yet, even if he isn't the main founder. Congratulations to all involved again. Read more about it [here on Mena's Corner](http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/07/vive_six_apart_1.shtml).

P.S.: Happy Birthday [Loic](http://www.loiclemeur.com/)! What a persent you got there :)

&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: And now Mena is reporting that [Barak becomes CEO](http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/07/barak_at_six_ap.shtml) of Six Apart. Great choice Mena! You started to have the need to be [everywhere](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/07/blogtalk_20.html) and that would have broken you sooner or later. Now go advance blogging!
