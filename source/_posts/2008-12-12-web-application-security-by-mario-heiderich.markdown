[The book](http://php-ids.org/2008/12/11/it-has-landed/) is in german and called &quot;[Sichere Webanwendungen](http://www.amazon.de/Sichere-Webanwendungen-Flash-Sicherheit-Session-Hijacking-Web-2-0-Sicherheit/dp/3836211947/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1228948140&amp;sr=8-1)&quot; and Mario is not the only author, but having been one of the key people at Ormigo, I thought I'd mention that a book he co-wrote is out. Other authors include [fukami](http://blog.fukami.io/), [Christian Matthies](http://christ1an.blogspot.com/) and Johannes Dahse.

And if somebody knows what web site security is about, then [Mario](http://mario.heideri.ch/) is the man. So much so that he can get on your nerves some times and I say that as the higest form of flattery ;). On a side note, he developed [PHPIDS](http://php-ids.org/) at Ormigo.
