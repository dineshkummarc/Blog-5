&lt;p&gt;This [Gasoil Inc](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/who_the_hell_is.html) [thing](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/who_could_gasoi.html) is confusing me more and more. I tried to look again and just found out that [Brin's sales plan](http://biz.yahoo.com/t/80/5092.html) bought 481,113 GASO.OB shares in the non open market for $0 per share and sold them again on the same day for $85 netting him $40,894,605. Either he still has the same number of shares still now or the current page is off. 24th of August is also the date Eric Schmidt sold his shares in Gasoil Inc, with the same number still listed on the page: He bought for $0 twice and then sold again for $85, giving him once $24,079,905 and once $7,282,120. I didn't calculate it exactly but that seems to be more than his current sales of Google stock, though I might be wrong. Wayne Rosing came out of whatever this is with $5,962,665. Larry Page got $41,005,275. When I looked at this some time ago I thought they were still holding that stock but that doesn't seem to be the case. They all made millions in one day. Oh, did I tell you that the 24th was just 5 days after the IPO on the 19th? Google was trading at [$104.87 on that day](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=GOOG&amp;a=07&amp;b=18&amp;c=2004&amp;d=07&amp;e=24&amp;f=2004&amp;g=d).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets look at [the SEC filing for the Google IPO](http://eol.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_html/2004/08/16/0001193125-04-141838.html). Ok, didn't find anything in there about Gasoil Inc.. Somebody please enlighten me what happened? Who bought all those shares for that one price? Where are they now? Does Google now own hundreds of thousands of shares of Gasoil Inc? Did Google maybe buy Gasoil Inc? If they did, would they have to publish that? It actually sounds like it would be fully legal. I mean the Google founders can decide what they want due to how the Google shares are made up. Can this be what I have been looking for? Is this an amazingly clever plot to cash out early? Am I drawing too dark an image? Again, please enlighten me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; [What Gasoil Inc is](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/02/what_gasoil_inc.html) ... the solution. :)&lt;/p&gt;
