That's what most people do judging by a study from [Dieringer Research Group](http://www.thedrg.com/), which has looked at how many of your money goes out of your pocket in the offline world only after having been influenced by something that happened online. This can be finding product information or comparing products online or something else. All in all it looks like for every $1 spent on the internet, the same person spends another $1.70 in the real world. Needs to be looked at a lot in perspective, but this becomes important if you go into performance marketing and think about who is your referred customer, because offline is likely not trackable. A little bit more about the study can be found here: [From Online to Offline - and &quot;On Line&quot;](http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?1003080)
