As Nico [reported some time ago](http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1414) the german newspaper Handelsblatt has launched their [Handelsblatt global reporting](http://services.handelsblatt.de/global-reporting/default.asp) where they outfitted 28 global correspondants with a blog where they can report live, personal, stories that might or might not get reprinted in the press. Very nice indeed and it's good to see that Handelsblatt is pushing it this far and as professional.
