That's it. My old monitor sucked big time. It was a strain on the eyes and it was going nowhere. With general comfort with things that look good, an LCD monitor was appealing as it would take up less space ... it's good for the ego too ;) &quot;I big man! I LCD!&quot; ;) Well, now that I am a big man I am double happy because this baby kicks. Seriously. It's an 18&quot; LCD at a great price with very good quality, thanks to Medion. [Medion](http://www.medion.de/) is a huge PC company here that is growing like cracy supplying supermarkets and the like with hardware. They are going for the BIG number (capitals intended). They just stuck a deal with Best Buy to be part of their line up. The monitor I am using now will likely be a Belinea monitor, the company that now belongs to Medion. Of course it is named Microstar, doesn't have the brand name attached to it, doesn't have the testing, and doesn't have some other sex appeal but it costs just 100 EURs more than a mid class 15&quot;!!! I am sitting here with a brilliant 1280x1024 resolution, K&amp;ouml;lsch next to me, listening to Royksopp's night out and now I am posting to my blog ... ok, that's that, going to more interesting stuff now ;) ... but get an LCD! It kicks! ;)
