Or no one actually. In an [article](http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/0,1518,444918,00.html) on Spiegel, they give out the solution from Costas Efthimious, physics professor from the University of Central Florida. It's actually pretty simple. Presuming the first vampire appeared 1st of January 1600 and we have a world population of 536.870.911 people (it was roughly 500 million back then), we would all be vampires now.

Why that? We already know that vampires need to bite people to get their blood and those people become vampires themselves. Easy enough. So let's further presume that a vampire needs to bite one person per month. The first one then had a friend on 1st of February 1600. On the first of March 1600 there were already 4 vampires in the world. 29 months later (2^29) there would be no normal human beings left.

There you have it. You can sleep well. There are no vampires or they have a very low need for blood. Of course if we think that they only bite one person per 10 years, we might still have a few humans left, because due to maths, this really scales best at the end. Think what you will. :)
