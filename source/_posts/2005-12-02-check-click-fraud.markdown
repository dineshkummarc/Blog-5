Great article on Web Guerrilla entitled [The Truth About Click Fraud](http://www.webguerrilla.com/checkbook-seo/click-fraud/). In general the idea is good and I am looking forward to the numbers but the click-bot thing points at something even more scary. Imagine coupling that with a virus that replicated along thousands and thousands of machines. It could be set-up to give out a perfect IE header info when clicking, and run clicks on random sites by surfing around and simply clicking from time to time. The bots could even talk to each other telling themselves what kind of sites to target, at best the biggest sites out there which it could even find via Alexa for example.

Due to its randomness, and the problem that it ends up to be not any different than a normal user, I  really don't know how it would be filtered out. This would not really make anyone money, but it would just bring down the providers.
