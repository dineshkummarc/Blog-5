Amazon has a press release out with some interesting numbers for 2007, for those interested in them. It's already been going around the web, but here are some I really like and a few further links at the end. (Data seems to include .com, .co.uk, .de, .fr, .co.jp, .ca)

	* Busiest Day December 10th: 5.4 million items ordered, 62,5 per second!
	* On peek day their fulfillment network shipped 3.9 million units!
