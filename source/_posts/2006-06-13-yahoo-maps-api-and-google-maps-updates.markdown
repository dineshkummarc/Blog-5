[Jeremy just posted](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/006893.html) that the [Yahoo! Maps API](http://developer.yahoo.com/maps/) is now available for commercial use, which rocks. But sadly, they don't have any good data for Germany yet. Did they have that, it would be a lot more usably for somebody needing something like this for Germany. I really like their Ajax API but the best API is worth nothing without data. :)

Google Maps at the same time [announced](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/06/happy-birthday-google-earth.html) better data and the introduction of the geocoding that people asked about. It's street level, not house level but still. Very nice to know. But they also offer [Google Maps for Enterprise](http://www.google.com/enterprise/maps/) for commercial use. Kick ass. Checking out Geocoding now.
