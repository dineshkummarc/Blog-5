Do you have time on the 16th of June? Want to talk a bit about IT, media, advertising, internet, the future? What about getting together for a dinner in Cologne. The idea was actually started because [Seth Goldstein](http://majestic.typepad.com/) is coming over from the US for a few days and contacted me about organizing some event for a meeting of interesting people talking about interesting subjects. As I presume all my readers to be interesting people this post is a good place to start as any. Obviously I would be there, [Ingmar](http://bornholz.typepad.com/) is coming and maybe a few others want to join in.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A good place to meet would be the cellar at FrÃ¼h, a Cologne brewery, which gives us the added benefit to do something specific for Cologne too. So where is all this performance marketing going? Will Google take over the world or will they loose out once Microsoft gets into the ring next to Yahoo!. Why is Yahoo! fighting an underdog war anyway, with all the great things they have been doing lately? Which new spaces are appearing in the internet marketing world and will IPTV mean everything goes connected? Will TIVO kill TV? Is Ajax just a fad or will everything revolve around Ajax that is a bit application like? It would be a fun meeting. Contact me if you are interested. And you don't have to be a blogger by the way (though you might walk out becoming one ;)).

**Update**: At Ingmar's request, I added a wiki page right [here](http://thylmann.net/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=It+Dinner+June+16th+2005). It's on a freshly installed tikiwiki which I am trying out so bare with me while I play with it ;)
