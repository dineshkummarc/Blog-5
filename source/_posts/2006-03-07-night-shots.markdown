Oh the colors at night. I took my camera with me when going for a short shopping trip. I seem to have just missed the DHL guy bringing me my new Puma shoes (they didn't have my size in the shop.) by the way, but not that that matters. This is about the photos I took and they have only been marginally edited if that. Using a bit of underexposure on the camera was a good deal to get the dark colors out of the shots. So check out the [Night Shots Set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliver/sets/72057594076884213/).
