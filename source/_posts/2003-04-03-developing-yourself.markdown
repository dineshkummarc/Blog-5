You should take charge of your personal development and plan your career as the burden of career planning has shifted heavily on to the individual.

Sonnefeld et al (1988) identified four classifications of companies:

-	Fortresses: preoccupied with survival
-	Baseball teams: recruit externally, you identify with the professions not the company
-	Academies: Promote from within
-	Clubs: more concern for seniority and status then profit

â€œ It is no longer functional to define education as a process of transmitting what is known; it must now be defined as a lifelong process of enquiry. â€œ â€“ Knowles, 1980

There are 3 different ways of learning (MUD): from Memory, Understand and Doing.

Adults learn different then children and Knowles showed some differences:

-	Self-directive
-	Experienced
-	Ready to learn
-	Problem-centered

You will have four stages in learning: concrete experience, reflection, conceptualisation, testing.

People have different learning styles: Activist (concrete experience), Reflector (Observation, reflection), Theorist (Conceptualisation) and Pragmatist (Testing).

You need a plan, that is the most important part and some things will play a role in your future life. Those are bio-social, family relationships and career related.

To find out what are your core values, Schein used the term â€˜career anchorâ€™ in 1978. There are several classifications:

-	Technical / Function competence
-	General managerial competence
-	Autonomy / Independence
-	Security / Stability
-	Entrepreneurial creativity
-	Sense of service / dedication
-	Pure challenge
-	Lifestyle
