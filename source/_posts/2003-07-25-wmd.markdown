Well... I was reading [a Google article](http://news.com.com/2009-1088-984352.html?tag=fd_rndm) with some [fun stuff](http://www.google.com/intl/xx-bork/) in it. For example, Google only put the legal notice at the bottom of it's homepage because when they invited a focus group over, some people were sitting at the PC waiting for the page to load, or so they thought. Google thought that putting the notice where its most often found on other pages would make it clear that the page did fully load ;)

The most funny thing is this though, which is the top result for the search for [weapons mass destruction](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=weapons+mass+destruction&amp;spell=1) on Google.  [Check it out!](http://www.coxar.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/)
