I posted [about Jamba before](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/05/jamba_acquired_.html) but now I found [this amazing post](http://spreeblick.de/wp/index.php?p=324) talking about the founders of Jamba and the business model in general. It's in german and written in true [Die Sendung mit der Maus](http://www.die-maus.de/maus.phtml) style. You might want to try [Babelfish](http://babelfish.altavista.com/) for a translation if you are interested. This stuff is scrary indeed.

**Update:** As Agenturblog puts it, we are starting to have a [PR Gau](http://www.agenturblog.de/archives/2004/12/pr_gau_bei_jamb.php). This is starting to become really interesting :)

**Update 2: **Spreeblick, the site that started it all, has grown in linkrank at pubsub.com from 979202 yesterday to 15949 today. What a rise. See [here](http://www.pubsub.com/linkranks.php?dom=spreeblick.de) while it lasts.

**Update 3:**STOPALLE to 33333 will [make it stop](http://mobile6.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=3). Don't you just love blogs? ;)

**Update 4:** As agenturblog [reports](http://www.agenturblog.de/archives/2005/01/jamba_artikel_n.php) there will be a TV show on Germany TV featuring a few interviews with the bloggers around this ;)
