I just registered for the first course of the MBA program at the [OUBS](http://oubs.open.ac.uk/). When studying the last two courses, Certificate and Diploma in Management, I found out that I would probably not have done as well if I would have started two years earlier. Now I just read that you &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to be 27 to start the MBA at the OU. Well, good luck for me that I now am 27 then. It really felt good to be 27 just now ;)
