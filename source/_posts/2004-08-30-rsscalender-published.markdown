I am not sure if I really want to be doing this but it's a good experiment. I now publish my own [RSSCalendar.com](http://www.rsscalendar.com/) on [oliver.thylmann.com](http://oliver.thylmann.com/), which is starting to become a real portal to my world. Is it good that people know where I am? Is it not? Will it be interesting? Will some meetings come out of it. We will see. It's a great addition to the interconnectedness of all things. Thanks a lot to John for continuing to be some great additions to the service, as for example the option of a roling 30 days feeds which just gives you a view of the next 30 days of my life... well, there is a lot more to my life but that's the stuff I think is fun to share. :)
