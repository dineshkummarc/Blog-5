Heiko just [pointed me](http://www.hebig.com/archives/002773.shtml) to the latest post on the GM FastLane Blog: [Saturn: Product Will Reign](http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/archives/2005/01/saturn_product_1.html#more). This one is written by Bob Lutz, GM Vice Chairman and he does have a very nice writing style, very fit for blogging: &lt;I&gt;This is the first of many commentaries I will make on this forum, and Iâ€™d like to begin with, surprise, some product talk â€” specifically, Saturn products.&lt;/I&gt;

Yes, talk to your customers, in your real voice, with a picture in  there, so I can link in, connect, feel that it's a person talking there.
