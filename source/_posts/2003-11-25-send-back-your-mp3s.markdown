There is a new organisation in town. [Sendthemback.org](http://www.sendthemback.org/) is arguing that we are stealing MP3s and stealing is wrong. The say that while we think we simply share music, this is nothing else than shoplifting and piracy. &quot;No more! It's time to make it right by giving back what we stole!&quot; What did they do? They sent back all the MP3's they illegally downloaded, either:
- as file attachments in e-mails
- burn them on cd and send them back
- make the MP3s into text and then
-&gt; snail mail
-&gt; or fax them

As [this article](http://www.heise.de/tp/deutsch/inhalt/glosse/16123/1.html) on Telepolis points out, you can find out where to send your MP3s right [here if you are in Germany](http://www.ifpi.de/). :)
