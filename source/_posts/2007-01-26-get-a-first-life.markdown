Just found [Get a First Life](http://www.getafirstlife.com/) [via MIT Advertising Lab](http://adverlab.blogspot.com/2007/01/get-first-life.html). It's pretty simple. Go outside, it's free, and there are over 6 billion members already! Got any more questions? The have an FAQ for things like:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;  	Are five senses enough?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What's this body thing, and what do I do with the dangly bits?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why can't I build a dirigible with my mind?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Penguins, spoons and you -- what's life like among the flightless?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
So go there. As they say: &lt;em&gt;First Life is a 3D analog world where server lag does not exist.&lt;/em&gt;

Damn cool!
