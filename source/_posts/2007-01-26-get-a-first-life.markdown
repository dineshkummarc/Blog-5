Just found [Get a First Life](http://www.getafirstlife.com/) [via MIT Advertising Lab](http://adverlab.blogspot.com/2007/01/get-first-life.html). It's pretty simple. Go outside, it's free, and there are over 6 billion members already! Got any more questions? The have an FAQ for things like:

	*   	Are five senses enough?
	* What's this body thing, and what do I do with the dangly bits?
	* Why can't I build a dirigible with my mind?
	* Penguins, spoons and you -- what's life like among the flightless?

So go there. As they say: *First Life is a 3D analog world where server lag does not exist.*

Damn cool!
