Skype seems to have gone into partnership with Boingo Wireless. At least I just looked in the store on Skype to check my account and see if SkypeIn can now give out German phone numbers (they can't) and what to do I see? A link to [Skype Zones signup](https://signup.boingo.com/skype/selfcare/reg/start.do?SCC=SKPE200). You can use the entire Boingo Wireless Network for $7.95 a month, flat fee. Not too bad.
