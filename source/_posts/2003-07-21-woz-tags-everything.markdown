The apple co-founder WOZ has now revealed what his start-up in stealth mode has been brewing up for some time. They have developed a device, which costs $25 to produce, that can be attached to pretty much anything. It will allow the owner to monitor where the device, and hence the thing that is attached to it, is. An alert could be sent when the kid arrives at school, the pet leaves the garden or the car moves away from the parking lot. Doesn't sound to WOW really but it essentially gives you a huge sales potential of a quasi mobile phone. Many people could buy 10s of those things and companies could buy thousands! Great stuff.
