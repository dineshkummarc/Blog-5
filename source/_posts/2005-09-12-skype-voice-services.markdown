Skype recently announced their [Skype Voice Services](http://share.skype.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=188&amp;Itemid=69) and boy does it rock. Endless opportunities opening up again. 
In a nutshell, Skype Voice Services Program lets you offer your services through Skype calls. They can be free to callers, or you can choose to charge any price you set. In case of chargeable services, the caller pays using his/her Skype Credit.

There is a lot you can build with that. Just imagine the numbers of people that will be on Skype in a year from now. I might need help on something and I just call the Skype Help Line. Voice Recognition already seems to be in there, so you can automate the hell out of it and your employees helping at the ned of the line can be anywhere in the world. This kind of builds a voice internet with billing attached. Integrating it with chat means that you can talk to people, and then send them a link to a page pulling live info from Google Maps, supplanted with additional information from other web services. Oh the future is cool.
