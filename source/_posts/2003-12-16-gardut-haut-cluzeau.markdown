The wine of the occasion is a Chateau Gardut Haut-Cluzeau, Permieres Cotes de Blaye, 2000. I got this recently from my parents and thought it was about time to enjoy a good wine. This one is very nice, having a very full taste and diverse smell. It's a tiny bit heavy but not too much. I actually thought about maintaining some kind of list of the wines I drink and I never managed. Now I will do the obvious. I'll just blog about them. I hope I'll get better than &quot;tasty&quot; though ;)

The occasion? I just got the result from my latest MBA Exam, being in Strategy, which I passed. And on the same day I got a new and better contract at work, a place I really like to work at anyway.

Christmas gift shopping was successful too. All in all, this is a really good day!
