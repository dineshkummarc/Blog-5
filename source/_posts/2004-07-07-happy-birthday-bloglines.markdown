Bloglines has turned one year a few days ago and today they [posted about](http://www.bloglines.com/about/news#63) some new features. For one, they have a new design, which is actually really nice. At least from the first look. I am just not sure if it isn't too cluttered to result in an easy reading experience. I seem to be diverted a little bit from reading, but that might be a novelty aspect. They also added their own blog hosting service, kind of, which allows you to have a simple blog hosted by them, nicely integrated into bloglines. For now, it isn't something for me really and I am not sure if they are not spreading themselves a little bit thin with this. Now people will come tumbling down on them requesting some features for the blog. For now, I will stick with [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com/) for blogging and [Furl.net](http://www.furl.net/) as Rememberall. Bloglines of course will be my RSS reader of choice and even more happily so at this time. 

A very nice item from their post is how much they have grown. They get an average of over 5 Million hits a day! That's 150 Million hits a month! Congratulations people! Congratulations. I see you have added a sales team for advertising now. Let's see how it goes :)
