Google filed a patent recently which gives unprecendented info on how their ranking works. Inside Google has a [good post](http://google.blognewschannel.com/index.php/archives/2005/04/02/what-the-google-patent-means-for-webmasters/) about what this means for webmasters and you can find a wonderful [summary](http://www.socengine.com/seo/guide/google-historical-data-patent.html)  already. So go updating frequently, as it helps your rank, as does growth in link growth aka popularity growth (not popularity in itself). Nice stuff.
