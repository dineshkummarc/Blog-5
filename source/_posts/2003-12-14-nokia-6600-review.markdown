There is a very good and long review of the Nokia 6600 on [Powerpage](http://www.powerpage.org/cgi-bin/WebObjects/powerpage.woa/wa/story?newsID=11605) which also holds some information about interactivity with macs. I am already looking forward to getting the phone by the end of the year and will add some details of my own then. For now, this gives some very nice info with lots of pictures.
