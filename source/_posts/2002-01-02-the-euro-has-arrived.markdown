Well, I have my Euros now. Beyond the starter pack that is. I just went into the local Aldi to get some orange juice and some other things. Cost a total of about 8 DEM. The cashier asked me if I wanted to pay in DEM or EUR or both (boy they are good :)) and I said DEM. She then asked if I wanted to give her all my DEM. I told her I had 171 DEM with me. No problem. So I paid 8 DEM with 17something DEM and got 79 EUR back :)

I am now all EUR.

Which might be a problem. The coca-cola machine inside the hotel where my gf works should accept EUR now. The only problem is that the coin slot is too thin for the 50 cents piece, which is what a cola costs ;) What a joke. They were all standing there in amazement trying to get the coin in.
