Forbes has a great article on [Connection to eBay](http://www.forbes.com/home_asia/2003/11/26/cz_lg_1126ebay.html), an Accenture business to help companies sell their excess inventory on eBay. 

*Connection To eBay employs 92 people based at eBay's San Jose, Calif., campus. It makes the following pitch to manufacturers: Within 17 days, it will build a complete eBay distribution channel, handling everything from auction strategy, listing setup and management to pre- and post-sale customer support, checkout, order management, warehousing and shipping. So far, the service has drawn 60 customers. *
