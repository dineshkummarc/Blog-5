This one actually seems like a fun car:

[Smart Roadster](http://217.110.182.254/-snm-0135045592-1033119033-0000032129-0000000014-1034275333-enm-roadster/-snm-0135045592-1033119033-0000032129-0000000014-1034275334-enm-index.php?chapter=gallery&amp;PHPSESSID=b3cc83f52a673b00e3c64b3724efa17f).

It's from DaimlerChrysler (well from [Smart](http://www.smart.de/), but that belongs to DaimlerChrysler) and it costs roughly 15000 EURs. Only uses 5.5 Liters. It's more of a city car but a sporty one.
