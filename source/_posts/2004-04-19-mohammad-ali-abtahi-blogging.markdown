Thanks to [this post by David Weinberger](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002599.html) I just found [Mohammad Ali Abtahi's Blog](http://www.webnevesht.com/en/weblog/) and he is no less than the vice president (sounds weird I know ;)) of Iran! His views are amazing, e.g. from his short bio:

*Finally, the only way to salve Iran would be to bring about reforms that would fully democratize the Iranian society, and that would respect norms and practices of our traditions and religion. I have always held the Late Leader of Islamic Revolution in high esteem and have remained loyal to all his ideals and I treasure being in service of my Iranian people.*

Take a look at his [post about the coffee ritual](http://www.webnevesht.com/en/weblog/?id=1191107068) and his views on [why the problems in Iraq help Bush](http://www.webnevesht.com/en/weblog/?id=1700103450). I do also love the words on the side of his blog: *Let me be myself - Mohammad Ali Abtahi - in this website: regardless of my official and governmental status*. He also has some nice photos from Iran but ... I can't find his RSS/Atom Feed! I'd like to follow that one because I like what he has written up till now (at least what I have read) and his personal openess which is rarely found in other countries and which I would have never expected in the Iran!
