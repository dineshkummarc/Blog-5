This seems to be studies week. I just put my summaries of [Project Appraisal](http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/2004/03/project_apprais.html) and [Company Appraisal](http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/2004/03/company_apprais.html) online on the [OUBS Blog](http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/) in the last two days and to finish this off I just registered for a new course at the [OUBS](http://oubs.open.ac.uk/). This one is entitled &lt;i&gt;Creativity, Innovation and Change&lt;/i&gt; and will likely be both relaxing in relation to the current Finance course and a huge amount of fun. From what I hear it includes lots of different things to make up perfect teams, brainstorming, handling change, lots of interesting little tidbits. With the residential school on this one you are more or less asked to not stick with your group but to wonder arround, leave at any time, change groups, look at something else, ... wonder freely in a sense. Free your mind. I just hope that I will not free my mind up too much with this ;) We will see.
