It's not enough that we hack simple PCs. Now Slashdot is reporting that the [Canon Digital Rebel has been hacked into a pseudo-10D](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/06/02/004258&amp;mode=nested&amp;tid=137&amp;tid=164&amp;tid=185), which is $500 more expensive. As I am looking for a digital camera, and leaning towards to Olympus C-8080, this is interesting indeed to consider ;)
