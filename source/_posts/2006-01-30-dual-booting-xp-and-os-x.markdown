Oliver [points me](http://www.agenturblog.de/archives/2006/01/und-es-geht-doch-dual-booting-of-windows-xp-on-a-macbook-pro.php) to [this post](http://neosmart.net/blog/dual-booting-windows-xp-on-a-macbook/) which gives a good description of how to get Windows XP to boot on your MacBook Pro. Good to know that that's settled. :)
