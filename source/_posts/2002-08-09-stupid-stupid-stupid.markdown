I was hosting some pages at hosting24-7.com. Well. They are bankrupt. For 2 months or something. The service is offline. It's gone. They just charged me $57. WHAT THE FUCK!!!! Seriously pissed but looking forward to the mail from the VISA company. Seemed easy enough to reclaim the money. But I am pissed. Seriously.
