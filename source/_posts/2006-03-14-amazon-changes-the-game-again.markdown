Techcrunch is reporting about [Amazon's Grid Storage Web Service](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/14/amazon-grid-storage-web-service-launches/) called [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3). You pay $0.15 per GB of storage, and $0.20 of GB Transfer. This is amazing, period. you have to remember that you need to pay for maintenance and hardware otherwise, and $0.20 per GB transfer is ok, even though not great. There are bound to be some interesting applications around that to pop up. I know [Ingmar](http://bornholz.typepad.com/) just finished a script to turn virtually any video file into a flash video, perfect for moblogging. Adding Amazon's S3 you could store it there and just charge a small fine. You might even be able to recoup that with Ads. If you can scale down Videos to 1MB, possibly cache them somewhere if needed, then you just need a CPM of maybe $0.50 on Ads to be little bit profitable, without having calculated all that through to the end. Cool stuff.
