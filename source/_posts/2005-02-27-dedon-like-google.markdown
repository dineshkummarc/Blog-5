Just seeing a report on the german company [DEDON](http://www.dedon.de/main.html) and I see lots of similarities to Google and Semco. First of all they are growing like crazy and the founder is by now even saying that they need to try to lower their growth a bit as it starts to be unhealthy for the company. The founder Bobby Dekeyser has been a goal keeper in football previously and is bringing some football coaching systems into the company. 

First they also have an italian chef where everybody can get some very healthy food. They have a sauna, fitness center, squash court and showers in the offices. People jog to work and take a shower there. The founder has a Maserati which employees can take for a ride on the weekends. And now, they are getting their own hotel on their own island (no clue where) where employees can go for free. On top of that, he is making sure that employees can do what they want to be doing, including getting children and spending more time with them. This is what motivates people, makes them feel good, wanted and hence perform. At the same time they have a big factory in the philipines creating the base furniture where employees do morning work outs for example. All in all, a very interesting company and it shows again the balance you need to make between costs, motivation, understanding, ... . Congratulations!
