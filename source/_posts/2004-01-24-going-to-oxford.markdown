Tickets are booked and on my table. Come thursday I will be off to Bruxelles to continue to Milton Hill House in Abingdon near Oxford on Friday. Why? Each of my [MBA](http://oubs.open.ac.uk/) courses has a so called residential school, where lots of students meet somewhere with lots of tutors and go through the course. This time I am going to [Milton Hill House](http://www.uk-hotel-accommodation.co.uk/England/hotels/miltonhillhouse.cfm) and it looks very nice I have to say. It will be a three day event talking nothing but finance for most of the day, following by long evenings in the pub just to rise early and talk finance again. You guessed it, the current course is finance and I am just writing one of the required papers which is due on monday and boy is this stressing.

But who am I to complain, I chose to do this. :) And I am looking forward to seeing Oxford, some new students and generally get drawn into finance even further. Lovely subject.
