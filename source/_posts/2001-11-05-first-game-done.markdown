A well, that was actually nice. I just uninstalled IE6 and played the first game again. The story in general is interesting and the first game was about a system of 4x4 loud speakers, you click a speaker, it gives a ring tone, you click another one it also gives one and if they match you get points and they explode and are gone. Per try you get points deducted. It's not the most challenging game. The question now is if I want to get up at 6 am tomorrow morning to help some skaters excape somewhere... hmm... 6am ... hmm...
