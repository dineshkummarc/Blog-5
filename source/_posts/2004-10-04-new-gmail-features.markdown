InsideGoogle is [reporting about new GMail features](http://insidegoogle.blogspot.com/2004/10/new-gmail-features.html). Next to drafts and some other nice stuff, the cool one is that you seem to be able to get an Atom feed of your new mail! Kickass! The features didn't filter through to me yet but I am looking forward to this one.

**Update**: The Atom bit seems to have been a joke. At least I have all the other features now and Atom isn't one of them. Grrr....


**Update**: I have just [learned](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/pat/20041013#gmail_adds_atom_feeds) that everyone has an Atom feed from Google at [https://gmail.google.com/gmail/feed/atom](https://gmail.google.com/gmail/feed/atom) but the aggregator needs to support https and basic auth which isn't available in Bloglines. Sadly I therefore can't use it and I am not sure if it will even be possible for Bloglines to add basic auth.
