Some great tips in Allen's post about [&quot;Managing&quot; Your Board of Directors](http://allensblog.typepad.com/allens_blog/2005/06/managing_your_b.html). Lots of this stuff is applicable in a lot more places really. Provided you are in the lead on something, all the people that are important to a decision should know all the facts before hand. PowerPoints should  be short and precise, and everybody needs to be able to talk to anyone at any time. On top of that, you will have to let those in the team that did something present on what they did, not letting them write your presentation. The people on the board should have a lot of expertise, so write down what they say, get them to consult and try to bring up points before they do, going as hard as changes in your own role. It's first the company or profit center or whatever, then the team and then it's about you. Great info, easy and clear, but that's always how great info turns out to be.
