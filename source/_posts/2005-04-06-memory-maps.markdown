Lifehacker has [a post on Memory Maps](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/digital-photos/google-maps-flickr-memory-maps-038682.php), a combination of Google Maps and Flickr's annotation system. The idea is to take Google Maps Keyhole images, put them on Flickr and annotate them with their annotation function to show which places you have been to in your life, building as they call it, a memory map of your life. Very cool mix of technologies. You might even be able to use APIs to do that in the future. Cool^2!
