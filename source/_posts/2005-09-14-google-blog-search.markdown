John just [posted](http://battellemedia.com/archives/001862.php) about [blogsearch.google.com](http://blogsearch.google.com/). The FAQ is [here](http://www.google.com/help/about_blogsearch.html). The nice thing is that you can search for something and subscribe to the search. Search for your name and sort it by date and you have a subscription to for example [date-ordered updates on Thylmann](http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;q=Thylmann&amp;btnG=Search+Blogs&amp;scoring=d). Nothing too special just yet but still nice.
