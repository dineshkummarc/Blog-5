Check out [Britney Sex Bomb](http://www.boston.com/ae/music/cd_reviews/articles/2003/11/18/britneys_latest_sex_bomb/) from the Boston.com Arts and Entertainment Section. It's about Britney's latest album, where she tries to loose her old image. To quote: *It's a sex show, set to lascivious grooves and heavy breathing. In fact Spears's new musical path -- all roads lead to orgasm -- requires a minimum of actual singing.

And tell the truth: Who wouldn't rather hear her moan?*

I then then found [some pictures](http://news.focus.msn.de/G/GE/ge.htm?bild_tmp=8&amp;snr=2315&amp;streamsnr=9&amp;newssnr=126706) from her appearance at the American Music Awards and emm... it looks stupid. Sorry. They dress is _not_ sexy. /me shakes his head in disbelief.
