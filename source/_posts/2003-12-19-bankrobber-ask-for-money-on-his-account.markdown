Oh my god. A 20 year old spanish bank robber was amazingly clever. He went into a bank, put the gun up and demanded for 100 Million EURs to be put on his bank account. He then gave his ID and the money was wired. He even received a receipt and was arrested shortly afterwards... I think he just won the award for stupidest bank robber ever!
