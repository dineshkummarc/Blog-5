On FastCompany, Seth Godin [writes about scarcity](http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/77/sgodin.html) or rather, scarcity shortage. While I believe the scarcity with music or entertainment lies with the entertainment as such and not with the distribution, I do agree that a company that finds something that is scarce and enables it to be brought to customes at a good price has a very nice future ahead of them, if they can survive competition that is ;) 

&lt;I&gt;So what's scarce now? Respect. Honesty. Good judgment. Long-term relationships that lead to trust. None of these things guarantee loyalty in the face of cut-rate competition, though. So to that list I'll add this: an insanely low-cost structure based on outsourcing everything except your company's insight into what your customers really want to buy. If the work is boring, let someone else do it, faster and cheaper than you ever could. If your products are boring, kill them before your competition does.

Ultimately, what's scarce is that kind of courage--which is exactly what you can bring to the market.&lt;/I&gt;

Very good comment to end with.
