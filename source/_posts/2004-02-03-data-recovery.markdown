Is lost data really lost data? Based on [Scot's post](http://birdhouse.org/blog/archives/001205.php) on [Virtual Lab](http://www.binarybiz.com/vlab/) it isn't. Scot re-initialized some firewire drives that students at Berkley use, until he found out that he cleared one that would have needed a backup first by accident. His first idea was that all is lost but then he found [Virtual Lab](http://www.binarybiz.com/vlab/). To quote Scot:

*Took an hour to scan the 80GB drive, but it found everything that had been there before the wipe. And the angels up above sang hallelujah.*

They have a cool licensing plan too. You can scan for free, but to recover, you pay per GB. Of course they know that once they tell you that they found everything, there is no way you will not give them your credit card number. :)
