I called A9 the [ReSearch Engine](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/04/the_research_en.html) when I first started using it. Strangly enough I still go to Google a lot more ... I do wonder why. But back to the subject at hand. [A9](http://a9.com/) has introduced something very cool now, the A9 Yellow Pages. They drove through lots of cities in special trucks and took pictures of the shop storefronts. If you now search for shoes in New York in a special district you can look at the shop and also the other shops close by. Very nice indeed. Check out how they did it [A9.com &gt;here](http://a9.com/-/company/YellowPages.jsp).

**Update&lt;/B&gt;: Russell [points out](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008281.html) that this is not really &quot;never done before&quot; type of stuff. Still very cool though :)
