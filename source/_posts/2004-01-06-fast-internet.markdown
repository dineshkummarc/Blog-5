If you think you have a fast internet connection, even at work, check out [Jeremy's post](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001359.html) about downloading a new linux kernel at work (being Yahoo! ;)). It took all of 3 seconds to download an almost 30MB kernel. And I thought I have fast internet at work. I stand corrected ;)
