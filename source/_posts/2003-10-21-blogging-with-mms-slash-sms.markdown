Seems like [blog.txtsolutions.com](http://blog.txtsolutions.com/) is working on a system so everyone can post to any blog software (with the right login of course ;)). I am actually still looking at moblogging but without a camera phone it's a little less special. I am still waiting for a good phone to come out and then I will likely enable this little baby here to let me post to it from my mobile including images. But for now, watching the above URL for updates seems like a worthwhile thing. 

And while we are at it, you can [read this article](http://telephonyonline.com/ar/telecom_beyond_photoplay_mms/index.htm) for a bit more info on the problems moblogging might pose to telcos. It continues to go a lot more deeper into it, including billing problems and the like, only scratching the surface but already giving you an idea of what kind of changes we are looking at.
