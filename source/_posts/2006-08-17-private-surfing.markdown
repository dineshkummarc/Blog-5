Tired of governments knowing what you do online? Try &lt;a xhref=&quot;http://www.relakks.com/?lang=eng&quot; mce_href=&quot;http://www.relakks.com/?lang=eng&quot;&gt;Relakks, or rather wait a bit to try Relakks.

The idea is that they offer a special VPN Server over which all your network traffic will be handled, encrypted. The interest in the last few days has been so big though that they had to close registration to get more VPN Servers and handle payment a little bit more efficiently it seems. Congratulations to them!
