Apple just has a hand with design. While the new &lt;a title=&quot;Apple - iMac G5&quot; href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/imac/&quot;&gt;Apple - iMac G5&lt;/a&gt; isn't as interesting as the iMac G4 on the first look, the idea is very striking and it's a great concept. I mean, you just buy the box, with internal bluetooth and nocat of course, and you are done. Put it on your desk, attach the cable. Go. Very cool indeed. And it is a thing of beauty. I still want the Powerbook though ;)
