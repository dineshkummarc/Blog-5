Heiko has a [wonderful summary](http://www.hebig.com/archives/002821.shtml) about the now on sale FIFA World Cup tickets. First of all, you can order now, and there is a drawing based on all those that ordered tickets until the 31st of March. Strange enough. But you will have to give your name and the name will be on the ticket(s), which means you will need to know which game you want to go to with whom and when ... in June 2006! Fun :)
