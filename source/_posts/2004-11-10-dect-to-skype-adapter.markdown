Well this VoIP race is getting more and more interesting. In my latest post about it I said that Skype might have a problem that they are not SIP (see [here](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/09/skype_and_voip.html)). I still stand by that but still Skype is getting some interesting features I have to say. Based on [this article on MobileMag](http://www.mobilemag.com/content/100/104/C3402/) Siemens just released an USB Adapter that will allow you to link your PC Skype version to their DECT headsets. Now how cool is that? Very cool. Now Skype needs incoming call numbers world wide, so that I have a US number and a German Number and a Belgium number and a Dutch number and a UK number ... that are the most important ones I think at this moment. Thank you.
