[Jeff](http://sapventures.typepad.com/) has a very nice post entitled [Information Force Multiplier](http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2004/08/information_for.html) on his blog. He quotes an interview with General Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, from which he deducts an interesting idea. CEOs want and need to know what is happening at the front line, but often when just asking around, it's hard to get to the heart of the matter in a reasonable amount of time, due to boundaries of trust to name just one example. Of course you should establish trust and all that but another interesting idea for blogging is that you not only aggregate the blogs, but you also summarize it, get out the basic concepts behind it. If 20 people talk about the same thing I don't need to read all of their posts but I could see the overall idea they point to.

Maybe Apple's Summary mechanism might already work here somehow. I just summed up Jeff's post with it and it came out very nicely. 

*I think, you know, when you get to the four-star level, you fight to get information from the troops and you donâ€™t want to be a victim of just getting fed what the staff brings you every day.

...Of course, this isn't an entirely efficient process for an executive who probably already has too much on his/her plate, so the opportunity that exists from a tech standpoint is to aggregate blogs and apply BI techniques to sort, categorize, and apply qualitative filters to.*

There you go. As he says, that might be what Feedster and Technorati might also be up to. This would make the $12 million valuation for Technorati too low in my oppinion, but we will see.
