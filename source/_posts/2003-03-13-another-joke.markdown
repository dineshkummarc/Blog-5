I should set up a jokes category ;)

&lt;I&gt;An American tourist in Tel Aviv was about to enter the impressive Mann Auditorium to take in a concert by the Israel Philharmonic. 

He was admiring the unique architecture, the sweeping lines of the entrance, and the modern d√©cor throughout the building. 

Finally he turned to his friend and asked if the building was named for Thomas Mann, the world famous author. 

&quot;No,&quot; his friend said, &quot;it's named for Fredric Mann, from Philadelphia.&quot; 

&quot;Really? I never heard of him. What did he write?&quot;

&quot;A check.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;

Once again taken from the [TMF](http://www.fool.com/) boards.

And another one following.


&lt;!-- more --&gt;


&lt;I&gt;A 90 year old man was having his annual checkup and the doctor asked him how he was feeling. 
&quot;I've never been better!&quot; he boasted. &quot;I've got an eighteen year old bride who's pregnant and having my child! What do you think about that?&quot; 
The doctor considered this for a moment, then said, &quot;Let me tell you a story. I knew a guy who was an avid hunter. He never missed a season. But one day went out in a bit of a hurry and he accidentally grabbed his umbrella instead of his gun.&quot; 
The doctor continued, &quot;So he was in the woods and suddenly a grizzly bear appeared in front of him! He raised up his umbrella, pointed it at the bear and squeezed the handle. And do you know what happened?&quot; the doctor queried. 
Dumbfounded, the old man replied &quot;No&quot;. 
The doctor continued, &quot;The bear dropped dead in front of him!&quot; 
&quot;That's impossible!&quot; exclaimed the old man. &quot;Someone else must have shot that bear.&quot; 
&quot;That's kind of what I'm getting at...&quot; replied the doctor. &lt;/I&gt;
