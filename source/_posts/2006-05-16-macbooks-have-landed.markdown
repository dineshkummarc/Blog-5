The [MacBook](http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html) is here, as I [first read on TUAW](http://www.tuaw.com/2006/05/16/macbook-is-here-and-its-black/) and the top line model is black! First, they are nice. It would have been nice if it were even smaller and a bit lighter but yes it is very nice it seems. And the pricing strategy is brilliant. The thing is that the biggest model is black. Biggest in this case means it has 20GB more hard disk space. And it's black. Very black. And it's 200 EURs more expensive!!! This is the cool model that all those people will have that really believe it is worth the 200 EURs. Brilliant pricing strategy from Apple. Brilliant.

P.S.: I admit, I might even be one of those but I am trying to not to give in.
