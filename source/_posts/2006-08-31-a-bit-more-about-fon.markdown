[Georg Pagenstedt](https://www.openbc.com/hp/Georg_Pagenstedt/) [blogs about](http://blogrolle.net/2006/08/30/martin-varsavsky-worldwide-wireless-warrior/) Martin Versavsky's talk at the Medienwoche Berlin Brandenburg. Lots of interesting stuff in there especially that [fon](http://fon.com/) is now burning through 500k EURs a month and are looking at having 500.000 Hotspots in 2008 to break even. I am so happy to be part of the community and am already running two routers here in Cologne. And hey, I beat Georg in my Linus-Fonero number. He's in the 20s and I am in the 10s, 13095 to be exact. The post has a picture of Martin holding up the Fonera, their own router coming out soon, by the way.

**Update**: Another bit from [this Spiegel Interview](http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzkultur/0,1518,434591,00.html). Martin expects each FON Hotspot to earn them 1 EUR a month on average. Very sound numbers I think. All in all it is nice to see an experience entrepreneur talk about numbers a little bit, finding out how he convinced people of his idea at least partly.
