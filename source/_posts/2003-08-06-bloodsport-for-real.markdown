Seems that there is something like Bloodsport, in China, named &quot;Sanda&quot;. The first European will now try to compete. He is world champion in karate and has been training for 2 years with shaolin monchs. There are no rules in the fight and death at the end is not ruled out. [boy oh boy](http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-kurier/berlin/15038.html).
