I just found [this post of Russel Beattie](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1005359.html) via [Scobelizer's post](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/12/15.html#a5771). Russel talks about the [Nokia Content Syndication Program](http://ncsp.forum.nokia.com/content/) and I have to agree... WOW! You can get virtually every dev thing from Nokia via RSS Feeds in different forms and sizes. Want to stay up to date on what they do in CDMA, or Digital Rights Management or the Developer Platform or Series 60 Platform Content. There you go. Everything at your finger tips. Want to find all the docs? Russel found them [here](http://ncsp.forum.nokia.com/downloads/nokia/documents/)! He also points to [this mobile markets presentation](http://ncsp.forum.nokia.com/downloads/nokia/documents/Mobile_Market_Services.pdf) which has some nice stats (copied from [Russel's post](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1005359.html)): 

** Approx 1 billion SMS/day globally 
* Mobile ring tones are already a USD 3-5billion business 
* UK ring tones market will overtake the CDs singlesmarket 2003 
* UK: over 780 million WAPpage impression /month in June 2003 (130% growth in 9 months) 
* Est~10 millionmobile Java downloads globally / month in June 2003 
* Over 75 operators have launched mobile Java services 
* Over 140 operators have launched MMS (Aug 2003) 
* mmo2 reportsapprox 5 MMS /monthsper active user

Great stuff. I am looking through the feeds now to subscribe to some of them :)
