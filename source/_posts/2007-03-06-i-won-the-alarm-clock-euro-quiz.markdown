Wohoo! [alarm:clock euro](http://www.thealarmclock.com/euro/) had a [quiz](http://www.thealarmclock.com/euro/archives/2007/03/alarmclock_euro_puzz_16.html) again recently in which they asked to name the VC firm founder who made his first fortune in modems and fax cards. As a hint they added that the firm is now on its third and largest fund. Having run around in the venture scene a bit in the last few months, I obviously knew that they ment Dr. Gottfried Neuhaus from Neuhaus Partners in Hamburg. Also knowing Valerie form alarm:clock I had to quickly write the answer over to them and hey, I was the first! You can now see my wonderful picture right [here](http://www.thealarmclock.com/euro/archives/2007/03/alarmclock_euro_puzz_17.html).

A good distraction coming in the office in the morning ;)
