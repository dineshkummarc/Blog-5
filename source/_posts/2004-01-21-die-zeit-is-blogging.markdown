Thanks to [Heiko's post](http://www.hebig.com/archives/001864.shtml) to point out that the German Magazine Die Zeit does now have its own blog based on [Blogg.de](http://www.blogg.de/) called &lt;a title=&quot;Fundsachen&quot; href=&quot;http://blogg.zeit.de/fundsachen/&quot;&gt;Fundsachen&lt;/a&gt;. Very nice.
