I recently read about this one and it kicks: Welcome the  [Audi RSQ](http://www.audi.com/com/en/experience/irobot/audirsq/audirsq.jsp), built or the Film iRobot. All in all it looks amazing, period, but the coolest thing are the wheels... wait let me rephrase that, the spheres. This gets you all amounts of wild ideas. I mean if you drive on spheres you can go all directions, no matter where. And if you consider that with new cars that are being built in the future might have their motors in their wheels, allowing you to easily exchange the entire body, then this starts to get interesting. You just somehow need to get into this system for putting petrol and other things in there. Mind boggling. You can find out more about the car [via Google](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Audi+RSQ&amp;btnG=Google+Search).
