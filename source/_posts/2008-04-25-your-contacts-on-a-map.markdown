[Xing](http://xing.com) just [opened up their Maps Beta](http://blog.xing.com/2008/04/put-your-contac.html) for putting your contacts on a map. I've been playing with this for some time and while seemingly a simple feature, the implementation rocks. 

Within your Address Book you will not have a Maps link that will simply show your contacts on a map. Dependent on your Zoom level, you will have several contacts grouped together. These groupings then change when you zoom in. The fun thing is that you can filter based on your tags, or search for a city, to see which contacts you have in that city. Sadly the system does not allow you to mix and match searches and tags, allowing you to e.g. search for customers in berlin. You do have a preview of the contact data within the ad though.

But it is a good first step and I am looking forward to seeing more.
