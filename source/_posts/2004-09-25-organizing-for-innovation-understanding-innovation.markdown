Organizations need to innovate. But how do you manage and develop innovation? You can do radical and incremental innovation. Radical is often in impact and is mostly made up of lots of incremental steps though and then they will likely need further incremental steps to blossom and sometimes they depend on the right environment to work out. Another thing is to use technological fusion to bolt different things together to a new whole. Product and service innovation will later need a lot of enhancements to flourish. Process improvements often reduce costs and improve performance.
