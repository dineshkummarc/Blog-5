I now have this wonderful bit in my newsstream at Facebook.

&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.thylmann.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/picture-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get your Credit Report&quot; /&gt;

All in all, too flashy, too annoying but the worse thing is the targeting. I AM IN GERMANY!!! And Facebook knows that. Facebook even knows the city. They also know I have an MBA with a focus on among others Finance.

I have nothing against ads, hell I am in the ads business, making local merchants more successful through [Ormigo](https://ormigo.com/), but emmm... this is so un-targeted it is annoying and it is 100% not what Facebook is talking about and where the value is supposed to be. It's a standard UK Lead Gen business that is advertising for conversions. Really wonderful how they are doing. Clicks will likely be high, but Facebook has an advertiser there that tracks it's campaign very well so we will see how it goes.
