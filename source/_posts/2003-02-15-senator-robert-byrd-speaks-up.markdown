Now this a very interesting read, a transcript of a speach by Senator Robert Carlyle Byrd: [Senate Remarks: Reckless Administration May Reap Disastrous Consequences](http://byrd.senate.gov/byrd_newsroom/byrd_news_feb/news_2003_february/news_2003_february_9.html).

&lt;I&gt;To contemplate war is to think about the most horrible of human experiences.Â  On this February day, as this nation stands at the brink                              of battle, every American on some level must be contemplating the horrors of war. 

Yet, this Chamber is, for the most part, silent -- ominously, dreadfully silent.Â  There is no debate, no discussion, no attempt to lay out for the nation the pros and cons of this particular war.Â  There is nothing. &lt;/I&gt;
