&lt;p&gt;You need to transmit a message in a form that assures the recipients understand what it means and is not open to different interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On occasions, what people do not say is as important as what they do say and sometimes we communicate more by the way in which something is said.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Language Terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-	locution: the set of words arranged in some order. E.g.: â€œthis is a long meeting.&lt;br /&gt;
-	Illocution: can be hidden within the literal meaning of the words. E.g.: â€œTom is very thoroughâ€? might mean â€œTim is very slow, I would have finished this hours ago.â€?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deaux et al. (1993) said that we use words for five things :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-	describe something&lt;br /&gt;
-	trying to influence someone&lt;br /&gt;
-	expressing feelings or attitudes&lt;br /&gt;
-	making a commitment&lt;br /&gt;
-	trying to accomplish something directly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language Terms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-	meta language: words take on a specific but non-literal meaning&lt;br /&gt;
-	para language: how something is said (pitch, rhythm, intensity, pauses, non-verbal vocalisation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extend to which people can control and interpret non-verbal behaviour undoubtedly influences their success in communication. Things you need to control would include: body posture, waving, facial expression, eye contact â€“ gaze, body contact, orientation, personal space, â€¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic communication develops its own jargon (meta-language) and its own hidden meanings (para-language).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several approaches to visualise the communication process and Shannon and Weaver (1949) said that there are 4 necessary components (source, transmitter, receiver, destination).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information source -&gt; message -&gt; transmitter (encoding) -&gt; signal -&gt; noise source (message interference) -&gt; signal -&gt; receiver (decoding) -&gt; message -&gt; destination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This visualises that there can be a lot of problems along the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deaux et al. (1993) improved upon this model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-	both parties are sending and receiving (one talks, other one smiles).&lt;br /&gt;
-	both bring in expectations and understandings of â€œselfâ€? and â€œcontextâ€?&lt;br /&gt;
-	individuals needs to share some common ground&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this model, which was also used by Clark (1985), the emphasis is on the importance of context and the shared set of rules and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are often unaware of this and how we sound until we hear ourselves retrospectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of your communication needs you need first of all to stay informed and keep people informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding (sharing of the believes) your audience is critical to any form of communication and a key aspect of any presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of communication climate you can have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-	Open and Supportive&lt;br /&gt;
o	Descriptive&lt;br /&gt;
o	Solution-oriented&lt;br /&gt;
o	Open and honest&lt;br /&gt;
o	Egalitarian&lt;br /&gt;
o	Forgiving&lt;br /&gt;
o	Feedback&lt;br /&gt;
-	Closed&lt;br /&gt;
o	Judgemental&lt;br /&gt;
o	Controlling&lt;br /&gt;
o	Deceptive&lt;br /&gt;
o	Non-caring&lt;br /&gt;
o	Superior&lt;br /&gt;
o	Dogmatic&lt;br /&gt;
o	Hostile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously the open ones are much more pleasant to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening is another important part of communication and there are three types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-	Support listening: your role is to show that you understand without deterring the other person from continuing&lt;br /&gt;
-	Responding listening: relationship building. The sharing aspect of the communication is more important than the information-gathering aspect.&lt;br /&gt;
-	Retention listening: listening for facts and hard information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skills for active listening include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-	listening for message content&lt;br /&gt;
-	recognising barriers, seeking clarification&lt;br /&gt;
-	identify the purpose&lt;br /&gt;
-	respond with facial expressions and gestures&lt;br /&gt;
-	check (do verbal and non-verbal cues fit?)&lt;br /&gt;
-	encourage&lt;br /&gt;
-	reflect
&lt;/p&gt;
