Ok, [VISA](http://www.visa.com/) rocks! I just wanted to buy something from [Cyberport](http://cyberport.de/) (a DVB-T Receiver to be exact ;)) and when hitting enter the system said that my Visa Card was not accepted. Damn! I called the Lufthansa VISA Card Service line and yes, the card was blocked and they handed me over to the fraud department. It seems that some weird company booked 1,42 USD from my card on Saturday and this was detected as likely fraud by the VISA backend. I will not get a new card. This alone is very nice. The kicker comes in when you remember that they have millions and millions of cards. When working with banks you have problems that they can't update their web site more than twice in 20 years because of security problems. VISA is a huge clearing house and they probably have millions of transactions a day. One would imagine that some security concerns would make some things impossible. But their founding principle was the following:

&lt;em&gt;If anything imaginable was possible, if there were no constraints whatever, what would be the nature of an ideal organization to create and world's premier system for the exchange of value? - Founding principle of VISA&lt;/em&gt;

So what to do. I asked what I can now do to buy the item in the store because I don't have the new card yet and I need the receiver tomorrow. The girl at the other end asked whether I was just in the shop and I said that it's an online shop and I just need to press this little button. Ok, she said, try again please. I did, it worked and she said she already blocked the card again, citing the amount that I just paid.

Is that cool or what. Thanks Visa!
