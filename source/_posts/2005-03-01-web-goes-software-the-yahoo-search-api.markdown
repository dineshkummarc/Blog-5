&lt;p&gt;This is starting to get mightily cool. Yahoo! just [announced](http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000084.html) their [Yahoo! Developer Network](http://developer.yahoo.net/) and Search Services. This web stuff is really coming of age now and things are starting to rumble with &quot;websites&quot; offering developer networks more and more. Now you can plug in to Web, Image, News, Video or Local Search via standard APIs. They also have a [Blog](http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/) and a [Wiki](http://developer.yahoo.net/wiki/). John Battelle [ads](http://battellemedia.com/archives/001291.php) that Overture will be rebranded Yahoo! Search Marketing Solutions and he also has the press release from Yahoo! on his site. Jeremy will probably [keep a list of links](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/004299.html) in relation to this on this site and also ads that this makes his new job a lot clearer and that there will be a book out this summer entitled Yahoo! Hacks. At the same time, Ken Rudman [seems](http://waxy.org/archive/2005/02/28/yahoos_c.shtml) to be running [Overture Ads on his Site](http://emmanate.org/wretch/) which hints at a possible [AdSense](http://www.google.com/adsense) liks system from [Overture](http://www.overture.com), or should I say Yahoo! Search Marketing Solutions. Lots and lots of interesting stuff going on around Yahoo!. &lt;/p&gt;
