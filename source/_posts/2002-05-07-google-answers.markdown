Google is currently testing a new service called [Google Answers](https://answers.google.com/answers/main), which is something that I wanted when I first came to the net. They are looking for a group of freelance research staff that answer questions. Customers will be able to ask a question, say how much that answer is worth for them (currently between $4 and $50) and the researcher will get 75% of that money. I sent in a request to become a researcher, writing a short paragraph about why I want to do this and got accepted to try my luck. This got me into the second round in which they send you 25 questions of which you need to answer 5 and send them back, which I did yesterday. They are currently being reviewed. Would be fun.
