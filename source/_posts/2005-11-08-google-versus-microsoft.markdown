Cringely is always a good read and this weeks one is no exception. In his article entitled [It's Deja Vu All Over Again](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20051103.html) he looks at the current Microsoft versus Google battle and how it might play out. In general it was similar with Netscape. Microsoft was the underdog and fought back with lots of money. Now the playing field is a bit more level with Google having enough money to really do what they want to do but I agree with Cringely that in the next 4 years, computers and the internet as we know it will radically change again and Microsoft will try to regain and keep control. That's what the company is about and rightfully so, it's a company. I am just not sure if control is something you will be able to have in the future. You might have an advantage through existing relationships but that's where it might end. It will be interesting to see what both companies will buy and build in the next few months. Watch out.
