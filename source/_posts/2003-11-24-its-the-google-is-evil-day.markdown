Well what do we have here today? Is it Google is evil day? It all started when I visited John Battelle's [post](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000092.php) about [this Fortune article](http://www.fortune.com/fortune/print/0,15935,548765,00.html). The Fortune article is actually very good, telling some juicy tidbits about Google:

*When the numbers pertain to Google, they look very, very good. In 18 months the company has quadrupled in size, now employing more than 1,300 people. Annualized revenues have sextupled, to about $900 million. Annualized pretax profits have grown by a factor of 23, to about $350 million, according to a handful of people who have been told the figures. Only a few high-tech companies in history, like Apple, Compaq, Sun, and more recently Amazon.com, have generated that kind of revenue growth so fast. None has made as much money doing itâ€”not even Netscape, which grew faster than Google has but made money in only one of its years. 
[...]
 We'll sing more of Google's praises later, but first the worrisome news: Google has grown arrogant, making some of its executives as frustrating to deal with in negotiations as AOL's cowboy salesmen during the bubble. It has grown so fast that employees and business partners are often confused about who does what. A rise of stock- and option-stoked greed is creating rifts within the company. Employees carp that Google is morphing in strange and nerve-racking ways. And talk swirls over the question of who's really in charge: CEO Schmidt or co-founders Brin and Page? *

Read it, it's good. But Fortune is not alone, as the [Boston Globe has another article on EvilGoogle](http://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2003/11/24/as_google_grows_critics_emerge/). 

*&quot;Google is about to join, I think, that rarified level enjoyed by Microsoft, the New York Yankees, the United States of America,&quot; said Hayson [Editor of Watching Google like a hawk]. &quot;Too big, too powerful, too successful, too rich. And you're starting to see the rumblings right now.&quot;*
