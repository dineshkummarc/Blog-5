Well, today was a productive day it seems. I want to bed very early yesterday which resulted in finally being fully awake today for the entire day, starting around 8am, which is way early for me normally.

Of course, the video recorder did not record all of Event Horizon from yesterday, which drove me mad. But thankfully I took a look if all of it was on the tape as it would have been even worse if I noticed half way through the film.


I am currently trying to find a way for Dmail (from [Netwinsite](http://www.netwinsite.com/)) to filter out all attachements that are sent to us (STATSnet) and send a reply saying to go to (http://blah/upload.php) to upload the file. This would get rid of a lot of the spam and help us not get a lot of the viri, which again would be wonderful. The problem is I found out how to filter them out but not how to emm... reply in the case they are filtered out, and that is a pain ;) I hope their mailing list can help. They should.

I am also currently trying to register with developer status at moreover.com to be able to parse their headlines or something. This seems to be possible somehow, but before getting approved I can't say. I am visiting so many different sites each morning that I think there must be a better way. So I am trying to get moreover.com to get me a lot of headlines, then stuff like infosync.no, osnews.com, slashdot.org, theregister.com, ... all those. The thing is that in most cases it will be enough to read the headline and you only end up reading one or two items. But otherwise I feel like I missed something ;)

I also wrote an LJ Style that will publish an RDF like file of your friends page, which would allow me to incorporate that too.

Just trying to get myself a lot more organized. 

Also I did get a lot of paperwork out of the way today and my desk is getting cleaner again, which is feels wonderful. 

Open University work is getting along nicely, currently close to finishing the last book and then there will be revision until the test on the 29th in Frankfurt. I really wonder why they had to not have a test in Neuss this time which would be so much closer to me. Damn! Ah well, I don't know Frankfurt yet.

Sadly my tutor also told us today that she will not be our tutor in the Diploma course but that we will get a new one. She is getting some other group (possibly). This is very sad as this tutor was just plain amazing, I will have to keep in contact. I am looking forward to meeting the next one though.
