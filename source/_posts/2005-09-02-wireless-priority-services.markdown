When a telecom tower is full, you will not get a call with your mobile phone through. Of course, they do have Quality of Service systems attached to their entire network, mobile networks that is. In Germany, you will have to be someone special to get this, but it seems that in the US, at least at Cingular Wireless, you can buy it as a &lt;a title=&quot;Wireless Priority Services - Cingular Wireless&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cingular.com/government/wirelesspriority&quot;&gt;Wireless Priority Services. Of course it needs to be an emergency, so you can't just use it to call your loved ones at new years, but still the system is very nice. It goes so far that if you have a special clearance, and you are being called but the tower you are logged in to is full, then somebody else will be disconnected. Now how cool is that :)
