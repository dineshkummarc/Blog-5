I seem to be liking this Dan Brown guy. This is the second book I read from him and I have to say that [Deception Point](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671027387/bizkiffer-20) didn't let me down. I started Friday and was done Sunday evening, during a busy weekend. Dan is very good at story telling and giving you a good feel for the characters while the plot twists and turns. This, and the added benefit that it's full of interesting technology, makes this a wonderful book for me. If you are not interesting in special surveilance machinery and science, this again isn't really your book. But if you are, you'll be happy reading this. Not as good as [The Da Vinci Code](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/05/review_the_da_v.html), but a wonderful read non the less.
