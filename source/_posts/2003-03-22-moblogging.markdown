It seems that my article on [moblogging](http://www.infosync.no/system/print/index.php?id=2583) on infoSync is getting some attention. &lt;a title=&quot;Guardian Unlimited | Online | Weblogs get upwardly mobile&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/webwatch/story/0,12455,858719,00.html&quot;&gt;Weblogs get upwardly mobile is an article by Jane Perrone about the future state of moblogging. I found this via [a story](http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/000442.html) on Smart Mobs. The post has a link to a [Vodafone Gallery Demonstration](http://vodafonegallery.com/demonstration/) which shows that Mobile Carriers are actually thinking about all this.
