There we have it: [John Battelle's Searchblog: News: Yahoo Says: 2 Gigs to You, Google](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000708.php)

Users of the free Yahoo! Mail now have 100MB and pay users have 2 GB! Woohoooo! Sooner or later they will just say &quot;unlimited&quot; because who the hell gets more than a few MB of mail anyway, or rather keeps them!? Very few people I'd say. 

I just want Google to allow me to put photos in my storage too and link to them as well. That would make me even happier about GMail and all things Google.
