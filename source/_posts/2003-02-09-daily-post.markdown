Just found [this](http://www.c71123.com/daily_photo/index.php) on Scot Hacker's blog (&lt;a title=&quot;birdhouse.org :: Daily Photo&quot; href=&quot;http://www.birdhouse.org/blog/archives/000726.php&quot;&gt;birdhouse.org :: Daily Photo). This guy (not Scot ;)) is taking a picture of himself each day and puts it online. He has done so for five years it seems. Interesting to watch and keep an eye on.
