Ok, so P&amp;G bought Gillette, probably for similar reasons that Gillette bought Duracel. Dave Taylor has [a great post](http://www.intuitive.com/blog/archives/000974.html) looking at how much the $57 Billion really is. I can add one thing here, which is something a consultant from Accenture asked me once when thinking about big numbers. How many homes could you buy from that? Let's presume that you can buy a small house for $250.000. That's 4 houses for a million, meaning that it would buy you 228.000 houses! Even if you want a bit nicer houses it would still be a nice little town. :) The thing is that this number is a lot easier to understand than the money value.
