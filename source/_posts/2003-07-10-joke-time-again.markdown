A young guy from Texas moves to California and goes to a big &quot;everything
under one roof&quot; department store looking for a job. The manager says,
&quot;Do you have any sales experience?&quot;

The kid says, &quot;Yeah, I was a salesman back home in Texas.&quot; Well, the
boss liked the kid so he gave him the job &quot;You start tomorrow. I'll come down after we close and see how you did.&quot;

His first day on the job was rough but he got through it.

After the store was locked up, the boss came down. &quot;How many sales did
you make today?&quot;

The kid says, &quot;One.&quot;

The boss says, &quot;Just one? Our sales people average 20 or 30 sales a day.
How much was the sale for?&quot;

The kid says, &quot;$101,237.64.&quot;

The boss says, &quot;$101,237.64? What did you sell?&quot;

The Kid says, &quot;First I sold him a small fish hook. Then I sold him a
medium fish hook. Then I sold him a larger fish hook. Then I sold him a new fishing rod. Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down at the coast, so I told him he was gonna need a boat, so we went down to the boat department and I sold him that twin engine Chris Craft. Then he said he didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4X4 Blazer&quot;

The boss said, &quot;A guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a
boat and truck?&quot;

The Kid says, &quot;No, he came in here to buy a box of tampons for his wife
and I said, 'Well, your weekend's shot, you might as well go fishing.'&quot;
