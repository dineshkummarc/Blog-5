Seth posts about [the secret army of ad clickers](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/02/the_secret_army.html). I mentioned [clickfraud before](http://blog.thylmann.net/2004/12/clickbots_and_c.html) and said that while mathematic formulas like Fourrier Analysis might be able to calculate the level of click fraud and see unlikely changes and things, as soon as real people click in real ways all over the world, things get tricky. Another option would be a virus that installs a click application within millions of PCs. Google's Phds do have some work cut out for them there I believe. The page Seth links to is actually a Google Search: [earn rupees clicking ads](http://www.google.com/search?q=earn%20rupees%20clicking%20ads&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official) :)
