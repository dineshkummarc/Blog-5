[Cebit](http://www.cebit.de/) is just arround the corner now and the first invitations to press conferences are dropping in now. I seriously need to decide if I want to go by now and it would surely be interesting again. Siemens seems to be introducing the SL55 at the show, Nokia is said to show some interesting stuff and there is likely a lot more that is happening. 

On a related note, I will be getting the [Tel.Me](http://www.telme.at/) T919 soon for testing it seems. Looking forward to it. This seems to be one of the more interesting developments in the mobile phone world.
