Due to only having one TV Card at the moment, we needed a workaround. We now have EyeTV running on a mac, together with CyTV. CyTV then streams whatever comes in via EyeTV to the Network and in the meeting room the old G4 has VLC and shows the stream coming from the MacBook. Other users internally can obviously also tune in. :)
