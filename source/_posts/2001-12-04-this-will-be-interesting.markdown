In the last few days I have been renovating the old place in Aachen, painting and all. Starting on Thursday I got a bit of a cough, which was not too bad and I thought it was some kind of allergie because my nose had some problems too, which happens in recent times when I am in the old place. The place is very dusty and things and when I come back to Cologne my nose stops running almost the next day.

Anyway. The cough got a bit worse on friday evening and I had trouble sleeping because when I was in bed the coughing got worse and breathing was sometimes hard. Saturday was not too bad again but I didn't sleep more than 3 hours to Sunday and stayed home, going back to Aachen for some final work on the place and giving it back to the landlord. This was very early and I was not feeling well at all. There was still a lot of dust and smell from the paint in the place.

I later came back home to Cologne but the cough was not good and it was rather hard, I didn't cough up any green peaces or something. It was just coughing like crazy which hurt in my head each time. Breathing also got harder again which I thought was part of the cough.

Around 23:30 my girlfriend came back home after work and I knew that if something wouldn't change, and the stuff from the pharmacy that I had was not really working, then I wouldn't sleep any more than 1 or 2 hours this night and I wouldn't be able to take it. So we decided to go to the hospital which in the end was a good decision.

I had to walk really slowly to be able to feel like I had enough air in my lungs and when we finally came there the person there gave me oxigen right away, which is kind of a nice feeling I have to say. But my oxigen level in my blood was ok.

The doctor came and she listened a bit to what I had to say and listened to my lungs and stuff and well, she said that I have some spastic simptoms in my lung, something like an astma attack, not sure if that word is spelled like this in english.

After the xrays and blood tests it seems that I also have a slight infection in the lungs but nothing major. They gave me some medicine and I could breath again normally which rocks. I also got something to inhale for at home.

I have a date with a lung specialist tomorrow morning to really check my lungs out to see if it is was a one time thing, and alergic reaction, something else, ... it's all not sure. But hey, at the moment I am feeling like I have the flue, which rocks after not being able to breath ;)

I will post more on this interesting experience after my doctors visit tomorrow.
