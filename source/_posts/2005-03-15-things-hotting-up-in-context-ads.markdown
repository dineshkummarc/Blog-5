Ok, not that it itsn't hot already but now it seems that [Microsoft will get in the game](http://www.marketingvox.com/archives/2005/03/15/microsoft_to_bow_google_adwords_competitor/index.php?rss1). I am looking forward to seeing what they do as an AdWords competitor because at the moment I don't see a lot of innovation in the space. We'll also see what kind of AdSense solution they bring.
