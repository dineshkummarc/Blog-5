So who is the stock market winner? Based on [this article in XBiz](http://xbiz.com/articles/index.php?article_idp=979), [New Frontier Media](http://www.noof.com/) are one of the best performing stocks of last year it seems. Just check the [chart](http://quotes.fool.com/custom/fool/html-chart.asp?osymb=&amp;osymbols=noof&amp;symbols=noof&amp;currticker=NOOF&amp;time=5yr&amp;uf=0&amp;compidx=aaaaa%7E0&amp;ma=0&amp;symb=noof&amp;freq=1dy&amp;lf=1&amp;comp=&amp;type=128&amp;sid=7101). On January 2nd 2003 they were close to $1 and are now listed at over $10. Damn I missed that one!
