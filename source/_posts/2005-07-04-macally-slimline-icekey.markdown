Thanks to [Nico](http://lumma.de)'s [suggestion](http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1058) I just got a Macally SlimLine Icekey for my birthday on the 2nd. Very nice one indeed and yes, it makes a nice nice nice clickediclickediclick sound when you type. Wonderful. It was given to me via a simple card with all the letters mangled and I needed to guess what it was, mainly because the people who gave it to me thought that I would guess it at once if I got the packet. You can guess that it's pretty hard to figure this keyboard name out when they letters are mangled as it has such a silly name :)
&lt;/p&gt;
