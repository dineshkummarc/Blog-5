Nice open letter on SugarBank entitled: &lt;a title=&quot;Online Payments&quot; href=&quot;http://www.sugarbank.com/sam_sugars_blog/2005/06/an_open_letter_.html&quot;&gt;SugarBank: An Open Letter to Google RE: Online Payments&lt;/a&gt;. The author argues that Google should embrace the adult industry with their billing system. Very good point especially due to the amazing volume. It's a hard market but these guys and girls are often way beyond the others in how stuff works. Just think of marketing. A percentage of revenue is a standard billing method for affiliates there, and a good one at that. ([source](http://feeds.feedburner.com/JohnBattellesSearchblog?m=631))
