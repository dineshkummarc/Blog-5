This sunday I read the [June Issue](http://mag1.olivesoftware.com/am/welcome/BSN/BSN-2006-06.asp) of Business 2.0 and the title story is &quot;How to Build a Bullet Proof Startup&quot;. I am happy to report that we are doing rather well based on the list. As an example, we beat their specs for getting an office by a big margin: we are paying less than market rate, got the place renovated, don't have any commitment on the timeframe, and have just enough room for now with over 100 square meters blocked for us on the same floor. :)

For now, I am not sure we are bullet proof, but things are progressing nicely.

On and by the way, the system above to read Business 2.0 online rocks. Thanks Loic for [the pointer](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2006/07/web2_european_s.html).
