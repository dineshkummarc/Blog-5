Just read on Gizmodo that &lt;a title=&quot;iTunes Takes PayPal; Free Songs for New Users&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/portable-media/ipod/itunes-takes-paypal-free-songs-for-new-users-027424.php&quot;&gt;iTunes Takes PayPal&lt;/a&gt; now. eBay's payment service is slowly but surely become the internet payment standard for SMBs and people in general. Ok, credit cards are still not bad but we are getting there. Again a little happier about my eBay investment which is up more than 20% since I invested.
