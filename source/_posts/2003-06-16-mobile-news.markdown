Today seems to be a nice day for mobile news it seems. For one, Nokia has put me into problems now with the announcement of the [6600](http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/3699.html), something very close to the Siemens SX1 which I am thinking of getting as my next phone. This thing looks truely nice. Damn. Depending on the delay of the SX1 the 6600 looks very interesting. Of course, 4th quarter with Nokia always means end of 4th quarter, which makes it likely that the SX1 comes out first.

At the same time Iambic released a new version of [Agendus](http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/3701.html) which again looks interesting. It's probably the best PIM application for the Palm and it is getting better. 

Also, [AOL will offer the Danger Sidekick](http://www.brighthand.com/article/AOL_Picks_Sidekick_Over_RIM), or Hiptop, which is a big boost for Danger and great to say the least. The problem with getting this thing in Europe is that it [needs a flatrate](http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000600.php) and I don't see European carriers offering that any time soon. Sad really.
