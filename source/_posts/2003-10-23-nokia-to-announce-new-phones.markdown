&lt;a title=&quot;Yahoo! News - Nokia to Unveil Three New Cell Phones Next Week&quot; href=&quot;http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/nm/20031023/tc_nm/tech_nokia_phones_dc&quot;&gt;Nokia to Unveil Three New Cell Phones Next Week Reuters is reporting. I actually like the 6230 which is supposed to have bluetooth, radio, mp3 player and the like. Small and full featured if you still want to carry a palm to surf and check e-mail. Still going for the 6600 but interested none the less. The most important point might be that Nokia could do a move to allow more co-branding with carriers, which is something that carriers are complaining about as they want more force for their own brand. Co-Branding will likely be a good move there.
