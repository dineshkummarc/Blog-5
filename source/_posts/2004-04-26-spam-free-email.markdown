Finally. I should be spam free. My wonderful brother just installed SurgeMail by [Netwinsite](http://www.netwinsite.com/) as a replacement for Dmail, also from them, which was our previous eMail server. SurgeMail is kind of the new version, still has a few problems, but works overall. This has integrated a friends system, which makes sure that I only get eMail from people that authenticate themselves. For now, I should be spamfree. I already see the logs filling with people trying without success to eMail me. HA! Very good. This might even make me cancel [Oddpost](http://www.oddpost.com/), which I love but don't really need anymore, as I mostly used it for getting rid of spam. That is taken care of now. I can likely use mail2web for getting my eMails at works, which sadly blocks so many ports that the standard web interface of SurgeMail doesn't work out of the box. I will have to see if I can get arround that too, because the interface is really nice.
