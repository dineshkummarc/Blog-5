That's what [Bild.T-Online.de did this year, and gotten some angre collegues through. Check out their new &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.bild.t-online.de/corporate/content/download/2005-01-13_Preise_2005.pdf&quot;&gt;prices for 2005 in this PDF](http://web.bild.t-online.de/corporate/index.html). A fullsize banner costs â‚¬1,50 in rotation while it cost â‚¬7,50 previously and a Skyscraper costs â‚¬4,50 instead of â‚¬20. In relation to my [latest post on the CPM matter](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/cpm_rss_and_the.html) I applaud the move. With these prices we are slowly getting somewhere, even with some branding attached.
