I presume you all know [Google News](http://news.google.com/), but there is something like the same thing on steroids. I am talking about [Findory.com News](http://www.findory.com/cgi-bin/news.cgi). The site stores a cookie on your machine, which is a simple ID and whatever you read will be logged and via a special algorithm the site will change based on your preferences. Now that's a news portal. I admit though that I do still have to try it out ;) (Thanks to Joho the Blog for [the pointer](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002360.html))
