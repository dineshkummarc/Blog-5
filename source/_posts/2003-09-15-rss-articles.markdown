Judging by the number of articles coming out, RSS seems to be really taking off by now. [This one](http://www.clickz.com/em_mkt/opt/article.php/3074951) takes the Publishers view point and [here](http://www.clickz.com/search/opt/article.php/2190381) you can find a kind of do-it-yourself article. Also check out [RSS In Depth](http://www.intertwingly.net/slides/2003/seybold/) from Seybold 2003.
