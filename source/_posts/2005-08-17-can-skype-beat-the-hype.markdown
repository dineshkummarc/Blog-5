That's a title of a [good article on Skype](http://news.com.com/Can Skype beat the hype/2030-1069_3-5833667.html?tag=nefd.ac) at Knowledge@Wharton, giving a good overview of the business side of Skype and which way they might be going. And by the way, I also just printed my Skype nick on a business card. This thing is spreading.
