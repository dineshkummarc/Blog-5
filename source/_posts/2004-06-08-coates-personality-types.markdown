&lt;p&gt;As we are moving about, thinking in personality types, belbin roles, MBTI scores and the like, [Neil McIntosh](http://www.completetosh.com/) has [linked in his blog](http://www.completetosh.com/weblog/2004/03/coates_personal.html) to a new kind of personality type. These are being introduced (just to not say developed ;)) by [Tom Coates](http://www.plasticbag.org/), who has just now posted about the dimensions of [Pirate Dwarfs and Ninja Elves](http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2004/03/from_pirate_dwarves_to_ninja_elves.shtml). Oh my. I haven't figured out what I am yet, but it is a lot more refreshing to think of yourself as a Pirate Dwarf than a Resource Investigator ;)&lt;/p&gt;
