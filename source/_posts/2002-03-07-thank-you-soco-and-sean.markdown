I have to thank soco for asking for CD suggestions and sean for suggesting

Nathaniel Merriweather presents ... Lovage
Music to make love to your old lady by

The cd just rocks. I love &quot;Book of the month&quot;

Finding it was a horror though. I only got it in a CD store because the guy there searched for hit for a long time a week ago. The thing is that it was sorted in under techno/ambience under the name Dan the Automator which is the producer. Not under Nathaniel. Not under Merriweather. Not under Lovage. Under D, for Dan. 

Glad I have it now.
