Very cool. I just saw an ad for [ title=&quot;Lexus&quot;&gt;Lexus in Germany](http://www.lexus.de/) and they have a new [hybrid](http://www.lexus.com/models/hybrid/) car, the RX400h, a SUV Hybrid, 8.1 liters / km. Very nice indeed.

Update: As Steve pointed out, it's not 8.1 liters / km but 8.1 liters / 100 km :)
