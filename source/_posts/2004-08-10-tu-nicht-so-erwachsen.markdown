This is the main sentence in a lot of TV ads here in Germany at the moment: &quot;Tu nicht so erwachsen&quot;. Roughly translated it would mena something like: &quot;Don't pretend to be such an adult.&quot;. I was wondering what kind of ad it was until I saw a tiny URL at the bottom of the screen: [modus.de](http://modus.de/). So what is modus.de? Modus is the new car by Renault, kind of a smaller Scenic. I like the way they are trying to start a story with this thing and the car looks like a nice city car I have to admit. They will have to change the message a bit soon to get the story out that it's about the car though, at least from my feeling. The store starts to get stale at the moment. And I am very sorry, yes, Flash sites can be fun, but they are not easy to learn more about a car. I want simple and intuitive at some point of my travel. Otherwise, good intregration of different channels. To be commended! So check it out: &lt;a&gt;www.modus.de&lt;/a&gt;
