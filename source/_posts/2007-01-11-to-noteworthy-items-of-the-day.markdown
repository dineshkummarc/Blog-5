[Planblog is reporting](http://www.plansphere.com/blog/?p=520) that the [StudiVZ Blog](http://blog.studivz.net/) has been hacked. While this is not very interesting as such, and can happen, but the story is just too funny. In short, Konstantin Urban from [Holtzbrinck Ventures](http://www.holtzbrinck-ventures.com/index.php?de) said in an article that the [Chaos Computer Club](http://ccc.de/) has tried to hack StudiVZ and failed. Then CCC hacked (or so it seems) the blog to say this is not the case. As a small counter point, there is somebody that is part of some CCC club that to our knowledge tried to hack StudiVZ and failed, but that is not the same thing at CCC itself. Still, this is small mistake, and can be forgiven, it is still fun.

Also today, I learned that the contract with [Amazon](http://amazon.de/) for your shipment only comes into place when the item is shipped, not with the confirmation. Why do I know? Because we just read a confirmation very thoroughly, because this morning, 4 laptops were listed at Amazon.de with prices of roughly 20 EURs instead of their real prices and somebody here managed to grab a 1400 EUR Vaio for 20 EURs. Well 22 something because he needs to pay for shipment ;) He will possibly not get it though, at least Amazon doesn't have to send it, due to the rules they have set. I am not sure though if they will not do so, because of PR implications. I will update once we know.

Update: The laptop is being retracted and they are just saying its was an error. Damn good rules for them :)
