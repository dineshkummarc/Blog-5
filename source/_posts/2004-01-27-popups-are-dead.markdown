So that's that. With the release of the &lt;a title=&quot;MSN Toolbar Beta -- More Useful Everyday&quot; href=&quot;http://toolbar.msn.com/&quot;&gt;MSN Toolbar Beta &lt;i&gt;-- More Useful Everyday&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we have another toolbar with Popup blocker that will be distributed to millions. Ad to that, that AOL has one too if memory serves me right, and the Google Toolbar is installed everywhere... I think we can officially call Popups dead. Thank you.
