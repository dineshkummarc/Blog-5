It seems that Ward Cunningham, who seems to be [an extreme programmer extraordinaire](http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=0b0cbf42-af1b-4755-a68c-a71dfafa699b) and seems to [have invented the Wiki](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/12/15.html#a5789), is coming to Microsoft. They know how to get some talent those people :) At the moment, there is a nice collection of [Tips for Ward at Microsoft](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?TipsForWardAtMicrosoft) being collected at Ward's Wiki :)
