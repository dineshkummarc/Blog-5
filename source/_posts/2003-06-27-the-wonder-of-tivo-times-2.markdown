The [dream machine](http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/030625/law044_1.html) is out. Not expensive BUT WHO CARES!!!! Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc. introduced &quot;the world's first DVD recorders featuring the TiVo service. These new recorders offer consumers the control provided by the easy-to-use TiVo service integrated with advanced DVD recording for the option of short-term storage on a hard drive or long-term archival of broadcast programming on DVD-R/RW discs.&quot;

With 120 or 80 GB harddisk they offer: 

*     --  Schedule and record programs while playing a DVD.
     --  Play programs from the hard drive while recording from the hard drive
         onto a DVD.
     --  Watch a program from the beginning while the recorder simultaneously
         finishes the recording.
     --  Transfer content at high speeds from the hard drive to a DVD for
         long-term storage.
*

So much more ...

*Both units are equipped to transfer old videotapes to longer-lasting DVD-R or DVD-RW discs for more permanent storage. By connecting a VCR via analog inputs to the DVD recorder, transferring content becomes a snap.*

*The DVR-810H and DVR-57H will be available in the fall 2003 with a manufacturer's suggested retail price of $1,199 and $1,800 respectively.*

Ok. Really not cheap. But again, this is a geeks dream and in general where the world will move. [Check this](http://businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2003/tc20030627_1133_tc119.htm) to see why this is the future.
