I just found the [press release](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/news/dec1404.pdf) via [this heise story](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/54297). It doesn't say much other than Bill Gates is now on the Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s Board of Directors! Read that again! Heise says that he is there to look at investments in technology companies. This is a major move for Buffet in that he has previously shunned technology investments. He had a big stake in Microsoft and Bill Gates has a good amount of shares in Bershire Hathaway Inc. but this is a move that puts them a lot closer together. Looking forward to seeing what the Buffet Clan invests in next.
