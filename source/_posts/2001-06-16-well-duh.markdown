Thanks to  the Oxford Dictionary, &quot;DUH!&quot; (from Homer of the Simpsons) is now an official english word. Catch [the story](http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/06/14/english.newwords/index.html) on CNN.

**Update**: Hmmm... thanks to sean I now know that I really made a fool of myself :) It's DOH! not DUH!

I TOLD YOU ALL. TOOOO MUCHHHH FRIENDSSSSS
