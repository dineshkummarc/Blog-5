Now that [Forbes is writing about RSS](http://www.forbes.com/technology/2004/02/23/cx_ah_0223tentech.html), I think we can safely say that we are going mainstream. All I will now talk about is Atom, to make sure I keep my geek factor ;)

To always have a 101 with anything about RSS, check [this one out](http://www.marketingsherpa.com/print.cfm?contentid=2606#). Very nice read and good focus for the marketing people looking at RSS.
