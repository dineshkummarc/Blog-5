I received my iBook a few hours ago. It is beautiful and I love it. The only problem I have at the moment is that I don't have an internet connection. It somehow doesn't want to go up to the Wireless Gateway. The airport card is still missing so I have both the desktop and the laptop hocked up to a hub and that one is hooked up to a wireless bridge which again talks to the wireless gateway which is hooked up to the DSL modem. I can ping the  desktop but that's it. Very very weird. The desktop can ping the gateway and it gets out. Very weird... hmm...

&lt;B&gt;Update&lt;/B&gt;: Now online directly via the DSL modem. Not the best solution but will do for now. I need this damn Airport card :)
