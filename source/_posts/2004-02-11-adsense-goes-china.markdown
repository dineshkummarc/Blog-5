Based on [this Cnet story](http://news.com.com/2100-1024_3-5156992.html), Google is launching its ad service in China. This will likely include [AdSense](http://www.google.com/adsense/) and [AdWords](http://adwords.google.com/) and with China being a big market, this is a very interesting move to watch. It's be interesting to know how the interfaces work with the distinctly different character set and direction of texts.
