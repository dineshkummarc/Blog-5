Nokia has just released the Nokia 7700, or rather announced as always. It's a very interesting device. For good speculation about the future it might bring us (hell, it will only come Q2 2004) check out [this The Register story](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/68/33632.html). Of course this is not the only killer Nokia announced. Check the full list [here](http://www.nokia.com/nmic2003/new_releases.html).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
