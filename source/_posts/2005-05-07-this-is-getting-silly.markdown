Vonage just got another $200 million from VCs. Om Malik has [more](http://www.gigaom.com/2005/05/05/vonages-bainvoips-pain/). At that kind of money, I'd love to see sustainably competitive advantage, unique selling points, lock-in, and the like. I simply don't see it. Ok, I didn't invest a lot of time to think about it either, but many times this is pretty clear.
