We just arrived back from our Africa trip yesterday. One week of Safari in Tanzania followed by one week of beach and relaxation in Zanzibar. It was an amazing honeymoon and we have to thank all our friends who made the trip possible! I already created [an Africa set on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliver/sets/735315/) for you all to enjoy until I get back to a bit more regular posting. Lots of things to post about and lots of work to do now that I'm back, with the batteries fully loaded up again. Check out the set:
