[Firefox](http://getfirefox.com/) is great, and even greater is how good it gets when you add a few extensions. Here are mine.

	* [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/): While I don't have lots of scripts, things like [Download Video](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/4037) are great. I am looking forward to your suggestions.
	* [Better GMail](http://lifehacker.com/software/gmail/lifehacker-code-better-gmail-firefox-extension-251923.php): Ok, this one rocks. You can get saved searches to the left, get attachment icons, conversation view and best of al, macros. I can now navigate my gmail a lot more via the keyboard. Feels like Quicksilver for the Mac. :)
	* [Bluedot](http://bluedot.us): I am using Bluedot, and the add-on is obviously a must.
	* [CustomizeGoogle](http://www.customizegoogle.com/): This will let you make Google better. Very cool.
	* [Firefox Showcase](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/1810): Get an overview of all open windows.
	* [Firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/1843): You are doing web development? You need Firebug. Period.
	* [GMail Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/1320): Do you have several accounts? One on Google Hosted? Great tool to stay informed without keeping GMail Windows open.
	* [Live PageRank](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2007): No need for a Google Toolbar.
	* S3 Firefox Organizer and EC2 UI: Working with Amazon S3 or EC2. There you go. Great Tools to have.

There you go, those are my additions. Have fun with them.
