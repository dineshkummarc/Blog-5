[Oddpost has been acquired by Yahoo!](http://www.oddpost.com/yahoo.html)! Now this makes Oddpost an amazingly viable solution. Yahoo!'s premium service just got amazing. I am happy with GMail, and I did cancel my Oddpost account because I now longer really needed it but this rocks. Congrats to the Oddpost people and Yahoo!.
