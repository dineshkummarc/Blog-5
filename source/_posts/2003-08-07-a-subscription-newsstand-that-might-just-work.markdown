I have a feeling that [KeepMedia](http://www.keepmedia.com/) might just work. What they do is, give you access to a big archive of magazines for $4.95. The important item here is that it's an archive. You only get the magazine inside KeepMedia when the next issue of that publication comes to the newsstand. That is something that magazines hardly monetize and hence will gladly agree on for a small fee, if I understand the system correctly at least. I don't need to read Fast Company, Forbes, Inc. or Business Week when they come out. A month or a week later feels just fine really, especially if I can read all of them and many more for only $4.95. Interesting concept.
