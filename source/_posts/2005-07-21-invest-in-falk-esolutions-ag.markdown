Want to invest in a non public company? [Dirk](http://www.olbertz.de/) has 40 shares of [Falk eSolutions AG](http://www.falkag.de/) to sell. His post about it in german is [here](http://www.olbertz.de/archives/000561.html). â‚¬100 and I'd take one, just to have it, but I presume that's a little low ;)
