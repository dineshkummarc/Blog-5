... and $10 Million at that! From August Capital. A lot more stuff of interest was posted [here by Mena](http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/10/six_apart_serie.shtml). Congratulations to the team! Really wonderful to see you grow. The team is amazing and I know you have somebody that truely believes in the team when I see [this post by David](http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2004/000897.html). While I am at it, congratulations to [Heiko](http://www.hebig.com/) for getting TypeBlog.de out of beta and moved to [www.sixapart.de](http://www.sixapart.de/), which really means to me that you are now fully and unremovably Mr. Six Apart Germany, which is very nice to see. 

All in all a few great announcements. But I do wonder a little bit about the $10 Million. I presume that this values the company somewhere between $30 Million and $100 Million. A steep value, because it needs to go up by 40% per year or close to that until a buyout or IPO.  I do believe in blogging big time, and I think some from the team of Six Apart know that, but boy, this is a valuation ... I bow my head for those taking part in the negotiation. :)
