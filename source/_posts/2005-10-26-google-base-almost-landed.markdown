Ok, Google Base has almost landed. As Reported on several spots, like [here](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20051025-5480.html), Google is about to launch [Google Base](http://base.google.com/) and I have now gotten one step further than an error message. I now get a login prompt, but it does not accept my password.
