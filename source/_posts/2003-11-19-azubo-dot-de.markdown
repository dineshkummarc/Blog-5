[Azubo.de](http://www.azubo.de) is a new online auction place in Germany. The fun twist is that it works on the basis of a countdown system. The seller gives a starting price and a stop price. The auction then starts at the high start price going down (for example) a cent a second. Whoever strikes first wins. :) If eBay makes you sweat, just wait for sweating at this one :)
