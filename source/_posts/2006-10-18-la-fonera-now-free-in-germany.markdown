Starting today, people that are interested in joining the [FON](http://fon.com) Movement will be able to get their own free La Fonera, without giving their credit card or paying for shipment. You can get more info directly from [de.fon.com](http://de.fon.com) but here are the basics:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You get La Fonera&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You pay nothing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You hook La Fonera up to your DSL&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You descide if you want to be Linus or Bill&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You give it to a friend or neighbour when you don't want it anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Running two hotspots in Cologne I am looking forward to see more hotspots pop up on the map and really getting coverage with my [Nokia 770](http://nokia.de/770).

&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Martin gives a [bit more info](http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/fon/germany-and-austria-have-earned-our-trust.html) on his blog.
