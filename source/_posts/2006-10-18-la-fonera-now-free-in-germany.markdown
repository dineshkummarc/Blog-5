Starting today, people that are interested in joining the [FON](http://fon.com) Movement will be able to get their own free La Fonera, without giving their credit card or paying for shipment. You can get more info directly from [de.fon.com](http://de.fon.com) but here are the basics:

	* You get La Fonera
	* You pay nothing
	* You hook La Fonera up to your DSL
	* You descide if you want to be Linus or Bill
	* You give it to a friend or neighbour when you don't want it anymore.

Running two hotspots in Cologne I am looking forward to see more hotspots pop up on the map and really getting coverage with my [Nokia 770](http://nokia.de/770).

**Update**: Martin gives a [bit more info](http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/fon/germany-and-austria-have-earned-our-trust.html) on his blog.
