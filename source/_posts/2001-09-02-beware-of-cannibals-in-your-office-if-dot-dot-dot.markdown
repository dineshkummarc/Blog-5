Five cannibals get appointed as programmers in an IT company.
During the welcoming ceremony the boss says: &quot;You're all part of our team 
now.You can earn good money here, and you can go to the company canteen for 
something to eat.  Just don't trouble the other employees&quot;.  The cannibals 
promise not to trouble the other employees.
Four weeks later the boss returns and says: &quot;You're all working very
hard,and I'm very satisfied with all of you.  One of our cleaners has
disappeared however.  Do any of you know what happened to her?&quot;  The 
cannibals disavow all knowledge of the missing cleaner. After the boss has 
left, the leader of the cannibals says to the others &quot;Which of you idiots 
ate the cleaner?&quot;   A hand raises hesitantly, to which the leader of the 
cannibals says &quot;You fool!  For four weeks we've been eating Team Leaders, 
Managers,and Project Managers so no-one would notice anything, and you have 
to go and eat the cleaner!&quot;
