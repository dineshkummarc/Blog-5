Daring Fireball has a very nice [spotlight on spotlight](http://daringfireball.net/2004/07/spotlight_on_spotlight), which confirmes what friends of mine said in a meeting last week, that it's [Dominic Giampaolo](http://www.nobius.org/~dbg/)'s baby. I had to agree that it really sounds like it, having known Dominic through BeFS in the times when I was still doing BeNews. Very nice to see these names pop up again here and there. Steve Sakoman, who was Be's COO now seems to be leading the iPod Team.
