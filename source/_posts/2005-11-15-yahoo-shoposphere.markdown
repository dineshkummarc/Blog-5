I read about [Yahoo! Shoposphere](http://shopping.yahoo.com/shoposphere/) on [TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/11/14/yahoo-shoposphere-launches-tonight/) and my first trials with it ended up in the [Ultimate Entry Photogear](http://shopping.yahoo.com/mylist.html?user=othylmann&amp;listid=dcn-3-1132043355) picklist. Some of the stuff I have, some of the stuff I still want. I have to say that I really like the interface they put together with their picklists. When I wanted to add a photo to my picklist I needed to sign up to 360Â° which means you now can find me [there too](http://360.yahoo.com/othylmann). Yahoo! is really moving along nicely I have to say. If I wouldn't prefer to have my blogging on my own URL I would possibly start thinking about using 360Â° as the platform, as it is also done very nicely.

The nice thing about the lists with Yahoo! is that you can also get an RSS feed of them which means they can be easily integrated into you blog. Maybe somebody could make a system that allows me to build a quasi Google Ad from it and make this the default ad that runs on my Google AdSense Account. Nice way to publish my wish list. :)
