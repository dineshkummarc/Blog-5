As I am currently building an output file for access with mobile devices, I am ready &lt;a title=&quot;XHTML Basic&quot; href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/&quot;&gt;XHTML Basic&lt;/a&gt; and trying to take a look at the limited CSS capabilites in this implementation. The mobile and fixed internet are really moving together bit by bit. It's amazing. There will be so much power behind it! More info can be found in the [CSS Mobile Profile](http://www.w3.org/TR/css-mobile) and [here in an xhtml tutorial](http://developer.openwave.com/omdt/xhtml_tutorial.html)
