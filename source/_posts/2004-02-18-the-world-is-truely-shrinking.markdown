In his [*where are my car keys*](http://www.kung-foo.tv/blog/archives/000786.php) post Adriaan shows how small the world has become, at least for members of #joiito. 

*The uniqueness of this situation is that one guy in SF is without car keys, and it takes IRC and IM via Japan to make the connections that will lead Jonas to his treasure. Unreal.*

(and I still think that there is a secret &quot;links with first names&quot; theme going on to get people ranked well on a first name basis. It all started at Davos and has been going on ever since ;))
