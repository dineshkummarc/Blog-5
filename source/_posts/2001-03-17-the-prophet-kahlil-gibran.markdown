&lt;p&gt;Here a quote from The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran about Children:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your children are not your children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They come through you but not from you, and though they are with you yet they belong not to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may give them your love but not your thoughts, for they have their own thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may house their bodies but not their souls, for their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and he bends you with his might that his arrows may go swift and far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness; For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so he loves the bow that is stable.&lt;/p&gt;
