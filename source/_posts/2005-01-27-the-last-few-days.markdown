Wow, my last posts were on the 19th, over a week ago. Very scary indeed. I apologize and am not dead :)

The last few days were very busy though. I needed to get a presentation ready which involved some very long but productive meetings on the road to success, but success it was indeed and went very well. I am also in the process of writing, or trying to write rather, an assignement on intellectual capital accounting. Also in relation to the MBA, I found out that the residential school I booked, was at the one weekend where a lot was, suddenly, going on, so I tried to re-book and am now going to the UK on the 18th of February. I also had a great tutorial in frankfurt on knowledge management last weekend, having some very interesting discussions there indeed. I also &quot;got&quot; something else though. The flu! Hence I am posting this from bed but hope to be more or less ok again tomorrow. I am already feeling better today, having been down and out yesterday afternoon after getting myself through the first part of the day with some hard core medication. I slept a lot though and can only say again and again how wonderfully healing good sleep is! Now off to make myself a hot milk with honey to get this damn cough down a bit. This damn thing feels like the air is not moving out of my mouth when I cough but right into the back of my head trying to get out of my skull that way! Now if you are getting sick you know what will hit you ;)

&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/B&gt;: Cool, they are talking about me in TV. Well, ok, they are talking about the flu but still... seems like I am not the only one.
