&lt;p&gt;Ralf Beuker, my tutor for my strategy course for the MBA, has written a wonderful post entitled[Thank You for 2005!](http://www.design-management.de/archive/2005/12/thank-you/). If you ever wondered what Blogs can do for you, I suggest reading that one. We actually need more examples like this because what Blogs can do for you is very hard to explain sometimes. One thing that might nicely sum it up that Ralf very effectively built his Me Brand. I am looking forward to reading Ralf's post for 2006.&lt;br /&gt;
