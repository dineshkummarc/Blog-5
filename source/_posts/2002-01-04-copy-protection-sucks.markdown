So, I said it. Copy protection of CDs sucks. In many ways and my favority comes here. I bought the new No Doubt CD, which I really like. I also have an Archos Jukebox (6 GIG harddisk portable MP3 player) and I generally want my CDs in MP3 form. And what do you know, the No Doubt CD is copy protected which means I cannot rip the CD tracks of and encode them as MP3.

I somehow think this is not fair. I bought the damn CD and I want to be entitled to have them in another format if I so desire. I can even copy the CD if I want (CloneCD works wonderfully) but I can't get the WAV files and encode them. Grrrr... really pissed at the moment.
