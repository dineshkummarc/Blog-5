For those interested in the entire search engine field as well as direct marketing, I suggest reading [this weeks Silk Road](http://www.piperjaffray.com/info2.aspx?id=534) (thanks to [John](http://battellemedia.com/) for the pointer) which explains a little bit why PiperJaffray Analysts believe that CPC values will likely double even to a point where ROI is negative (you spend more than you make on the click in the first transaction). The value would then be coming from real livetime value of a customer, the problem being that many company don't even really know. Other than that it's interesting to not that vertical sites in special markets are gaining momentum and even though they are smaller than the big boys, they do attract a key audience and due to that fact will be able to attract advertisers interested into exactly this group of people. 

While I am at it, I suggest reading [Link Equity Explained](http://www.search-engine-book.co.uk/LinkEquityExplained.pdf), written by Mike Grehan, Managing Director of iProspect Europe.
