Greg Lindin hits the nail on the head with his [Kill Google, Vol. 3](http://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/04/kill-google-vol-3.html) post. He says, and I agree, that to kill Google, you do not need to build a better search engine, but rather build a better AdSense. The additional benefit with this is that you can compete on the AdSense front not solely based on technology. I do not think another closed system will win there though.
