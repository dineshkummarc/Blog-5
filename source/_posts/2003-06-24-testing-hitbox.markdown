I am currently giving [Hitbox Personal](http://www.hitboxcentral.com/) from [WebSideStory](http://www.websidestory.com/) a try as a statistics tool and for now I am very happy about what we achieved with [Counted!](http://www.counted.com/), especially because we are two people instead of an entire company. I have to admit though that their enterprise, e-commerce version and other services (most of which we had imagined too, but that is easy to say now) look very much nicer. Sadly they call cost money, or good for them rather ;) The 2nd biggest problem I have with the personal free version is for one that it needs the big banners which is annoying but understandable. The biggest problem though is that it just needs too many damn clicks to see anything! Everything is on its own page and that makes it very hard to get any decent kind of overview. I will play with it some more out of interest but it will likely disappear again soon. Just too annoying.
