Interesting business idea comes to me via [Steve Rubel's Micropersuasion](http://www.micropersuasion.com/). He links to [a post](http://susanmernit.blogspot.com/2004/11/ojr-msn-gm-imagines-blogging-business.html) by [Susan Mernit](http://susanmernit.blogspot.com/). She talks about MSN Network GM Scott More being quoted with something interesting. (Still following me? ;))

&lt;I&gt;&quot;If you're a blogger, MSN might come to you and say, 'We want to distribute you. We'll send you traffic and we want you to run these ads on your site, and you'll get a share of revenues on that. That's probably an offer that many bloggers are going to be interested in because they don't want to have to invest in creating that kind of infrastructure, and they would value the traffic.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;

Truely insightful. The thing is that they would be extending their reach greatly. Click through rates on blogs are likely a lot bigger than on the search engine directly. A well ranked blog on the MSN search engine will likely be ranked not too badly on others and get good traffic there too, again with higher click throughs. This is an interesting view on leveraging the long tail.
