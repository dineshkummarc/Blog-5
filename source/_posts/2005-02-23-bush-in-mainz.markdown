There is a wonderful post right [here](http://impfinity.org/index.php?blog=2&amp;title=bush_in_mainz&amp;more=1&amp;c=1) (in german, try [Babelfish](http://babelfish.altavista.com/) about what you can and can't do while bush is in town. Some highlights include: The frankfurt airport will be closed for 15 minutes when Bush takes off and lands. You also have to register visitors you will have on that day with the german police if you live close to the road Bush travels.

**Update: **Steve did a [translation](http://www.stevedix.de/blog/225) of the piece. Thanks a lot Steve.
