Frank Nuovo, the chief designer at Nokia, is now also chief designer of [Vertu](http://www.vertu.com/) (turn up your speakers if you go there). Vertu is a new company launched by Nokia. They will build Mobile Communication Devices. But not the standard stuff. They will only build those for the wealthy people of this earth. Limited edition, hand crafted, built by 200 people that Nokia hired that previously worked with jewlery, gold and other stuff.

Start date for the company is January 21st. 

Think gold pocket watch, think handmade swiss timekeeping devices for tens of thousands of euros. Drooling already.
