Instead of linking to a story myself, I'll just link to &lt;a title=&quot;Russell Beattie Notebook&quot; href=&quot;http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1006100.html&quot;&gt;Russell Beattie's notbook post instead, which has all the juicy bits and an analysis. I am not yet sure if I think it is good that Nokia controls Symbian now. Symbian is now Nokia, not the mobile phone OS in general anymore. Hmmm...
