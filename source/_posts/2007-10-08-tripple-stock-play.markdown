You need to maximize the value of your portfolio. That is very important. As OnVista was recently sold, with a nice premium, so I made a bit of money on that one. Having worked there, having built up what is now Ligatus, I knew that good things were bound to come out of it. But now they question comes how to maximize the free potential. As I have eBay and Nokia shares and have entrepreneurs and VCs tell me that they read this blog, I opted for the following: I hopped onto eBay and bought a nice Nokia N95. Welcome to portofolio maximization strategies, which also help me possibly do a bit of video blogging ;)
