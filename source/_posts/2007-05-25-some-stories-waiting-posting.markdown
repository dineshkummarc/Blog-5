As there are some things I'd like to link to I'll just aggregate them right here to finally get them out of the way. :)

First of all, [the Pirate Bay Legal](http://thepiratebay.org/legal) page is a real fun to read. As a background, they run their torrent servers in a country where hosting the torrent files that point to files of copyrighted material is just not illegal and so they are fully in the green for doing what they do. Their answers are to the point :)

[Qype](http://www.qype.com/) had a relaunch and I really like it. Congratulations to the people behind it. Very nice indeed. [Technorati](http://technorati.com) also had a very good relaunch and especially of note is the new [Technorati Search](http://s.technorati.com) page. I have to admit that after having been a [member since 2003](http://technorati.com/people/technorati/bizkiffer) I am really using Technorati more and more. It just happens very often that you want to know what people are saying right now and there the search is just a nice interface. Next up is the [Xing Marketplace](https://www.xing.com/marketplace/) which is really nicely done and I am looking forward to seeing how it develops. Still need to play with it though.

When you want to start a new coding project, I suggest taking a look at [Springloops](http://www.springloops.com/) if you do not have your own servers for development or even if you do, because it looks awfully well done. Setting something like this up is not an easy task, especially if you move to the Garden version and can set up automatic deployments. Our system now consists of live, staging, dev and integration servers, where the integration server checks trunk for changes in short cycles and automatically deploys the software, sending out alerts for failed tests. It even blames people via svn of errors ;) But we built it ourselves, just having the knowledge in the team.

On another note, [Jeremy just cannot quit](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/009093.html) with [Desktop Tower Defense](http://www.handdrawngames.com/DesktopTD/). I can understand that ;)
