In June I [talked to Bertrand Sereno about Semantic Blogging](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/06/semantic_bloggi.html) and he started to like the idea. It actually seems as if he liked it a great deal because he is using the knowledge from his studies in semantics to build a semantic blogging engine. [Version 0.0.0.0.1 of the Semantic Blogging Engine](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/bertrand/diary/?id=20040913090052) is already running on his computer. I am really looking forward to talking to him a bit more about his ideas and how to bring them into blogging in a good way.
