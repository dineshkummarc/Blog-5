Reuters published a story about [Arafat donating blood](http://us.news2.yimg.com/f/42/31/7m/dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010912/ts/attack_palestinian_reaction_dc_1.html).


It includes some quotes from Palestinians. Here is one I think is important.

&lt;I&gt;``We the Palestinians are human beings and we don't celebrate when others are mourning,' 42-year-old housewife Amal Qassem told Reuters from Bethlehem.

``Although Israel hits us every day with American Apache helicopters and uses American weapons to kill our people, we send our condolences to the families of the victims,' she said.&lt;/I&gt;
