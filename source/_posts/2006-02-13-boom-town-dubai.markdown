The Guardian has a great article called [Boom town](http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1708287,00.html) showing what is going on in Dubai and I'd like to show you one quote from it:
&lt;em&gt;A young boy is asked by his father &quot;What is two add two?&quot; &quot;Am I buying or am I selling?&quot; the boy says. Commerce is in the blood.
&lt;/em&gt;

'Nuff said. :)
