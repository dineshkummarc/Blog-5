(as found via a friends blog) *An old Arab man who has been living for 40 years in Idaho wanted to cultivate potatoes in his garden, but digging up the earth was getting to be too hard at his age. His only son, Ali, was studying in France, so he decided to send him an e-mail explaining the situation: &quot;Dear Ali: I feel very disappointed because this year I'll be unable to plant my potatoes in my garden. I am too old to plow the ground. I wish you were here, then my problems would be solved, because you would remove the soil for me. I love you, Dad&quot; &quot;Dad: For God's sake, DO NOT remove the ground of that garden. It's there that I have hidden ‘you-know-what’. I love you, Ali&quot; At 4 a.m. the next day the local police, plus FBI and CIA agents, along with Pentagon delegates, came in and turn the garden upside down looking for dangerous material to build bombs, anthrax or whatever. They found nothing and they left. The same day the old man received another e-mail from his son: &quot;Dear Dad: I am sure you can plant your potatoes now. It was the best I could do in the current circumstances. I love you, Ali&quot;*
