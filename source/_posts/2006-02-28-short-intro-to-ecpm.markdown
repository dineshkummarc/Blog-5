The Google AdSense Blog has a [good post on eCPM](http://adsense.blogspot.com/2006/02/ecpm-what-exactly-is-that.html) for those wondering how advertisement is paid. The general thing is that CPM, cost per 1000 impressions of advertisements (cost per mille to be exact), is a very good way to measure the success of a web site. My personal blog is in the 1 digit eCPM via AdSense while the [OUBS Blog](http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/) is in the double digits for example. The thing is though that just because it is a good way to measure like this, doesn't mean it's a good way to be paid in that form. But this will develop over the next years and with TV, radio, newspapers, ... being digitized it will happen there too. And attached to that are a million of cool opportunities.
