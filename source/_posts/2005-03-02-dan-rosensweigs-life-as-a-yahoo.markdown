Fast Company has a nice article from Dan rosensweig entitled: &lt;a title=&quot;Fast Company | My Life As A Yahoo&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/91/wikn.html&quot;&gt;Fast Company | My Life As A Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;. Two quotes: 

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/91/wikn.html&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We look for really smart people who have tremendous passion, great conviction and courage, and a little bit of willingness to go out there and take a risk, because when you're working in an industry that is evolving so rapidly, no one person has the right answer for anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is very difficult to understand, if you're not doing it, is the blending of experience, technology, and making acquisitions, when your business is reaching nearly 300 million people in 25 languages and is open 24-7 and where every user has an expectation that the product is built specifically for them. I don't think people understand how complex that is. The better we do our job, the less people will understand. And that's a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
