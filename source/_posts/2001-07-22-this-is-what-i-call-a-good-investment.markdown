It seems that SunTrust (http://www.suntrustwachoviaproposal.com/History.htm) has bought some Coca-Cola shares. To be exact, they bought $110,000 worth of shares in 1919. These are now 48,266,496 shares of common stock. The current share price is $46,11. This is worth roughly 2.2 Billion USD :) Nice return on investment I would say :)
