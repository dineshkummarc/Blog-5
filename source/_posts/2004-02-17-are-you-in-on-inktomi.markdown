With Yahoo! turning off [Google](http://www.google.com/) in the not to distant future, and moving fully to Inktomi results, you better be aware of how you are ranked in the search engine that would love you to pay for XML Paid Inclusion (meaning you are spiders certainly but ranked however they want). [Thanks to MarketingWonk](http://www.marketingwonk.com/archives/2004/02/16/e088_template_gives_sneak_peak_at_coming_inktomi_search_mayhem/index.php) I found [this post](http://www.seroundtable.com/archives/000110.html) on the [Search Engine Round Table Weblog](http://www.seroundtable.com/). It seems that if you add &amp;tmpl=E088 to your search query you will get the [Inktomi Results](http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Oliver+Thylmann&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;n=20&amp;fl=0&amp;x=wrt&amp;tmpl=E088) instead of [a mix of Google, Inktomi and whatever](http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Oliver+Thylmann&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;n=20&amp;fl=0&amp;x=wrt). For my own name, I'd have to say that the Google results do look a bit better, especially because they are fresher. My old domain *ennead.de* is now fully redirected with 301 error code to the new blog or homepage or even post and should be out of the index by now, having been like this for well over 4 weeks. I will have to give Inktomi some time of course. They do again seem to put more weight on the domain name, with *oliver.thylmann.com* coming out on top with a totally stupid description.
