The [Nokia 6600 user guide](http://nds1.nokia.com/phones/files/guides/Nokia_6600_UG_de.pdf) is out now which can mean, but must not, that the release of the phone is near. With Nokia reporting Q3 numbers today it might be a good message to say that the 6600 is out now. Crossing my fingers. I really want the phone.
