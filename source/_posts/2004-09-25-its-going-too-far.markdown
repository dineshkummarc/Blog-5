As I am summarizing my MBA Course on my blog, I get some interesting feedback from time to time. Now the feedback is turning into a tiny, but weird, discussion. I have been getting tons of comments on a post from 2003 entitled &lt;I&gt;[Analyzing the Industry Environment](http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/2003/06/analyzing_the_i.html)&lt;/I&gt;. People kind of ask me if I can send them a Porter 5 Forces Analysis for the hotel industry or the airline industry for example. Around the middle of the comments you will see a post from myself saying that I can't do that. The comments continue. The fun starts at the last two comments (at this time). On September 18th, David asked if I had a Porter's 5 Forces of the airline industry for him. Now Steve replied that he hopes that David gets &quot;done for plaigerism&quot; (I think he means caught for plagiarism.) and that he will report him to his tutor. Boy oh boy, I am starting to be a trouble maker with the [OUBS Blog](http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/). ;)
