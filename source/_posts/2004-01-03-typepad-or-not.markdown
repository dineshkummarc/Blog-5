I am really torn at the moment. I just don't know if I should move my blogging over to [Typepad](http://www.typepad.com/). MovableType is obviously a lot more powerful when running on your own server, especially considering that you can also play arround in PHP, give people their own blogs, use MFOP2 to moblogging, ... But Typepad is very clean, well thought through, provides a lot of nice add-ons and the pro version let's you have full access to the templates, which is ok. It would also allow me to further move away from administering a real server or hosting account. I have to admit that that is currently not a real problem as I still have a server sitting arround with space, it just misses some libraries to run MovableType at the moment, but this could be fixed. I want to quit this server as the company running it sucks. 

So I have two options. Install MovableType on the counted.com servers, waiting for 3.0 to get even more power, or further detach myself from a hosting system, moving to Typepad for my blogging instead. It's probably a question of power versus comfort.

If people have done the move to Typepad and/or back, I would welcome your thoughts.
