TJ [writes about](http://www.tjacobi.com/archives/innovative_recruiting.html) a new site called [karmaONE](http://www.karmaone.org/), which is a new job site with an interesting twist: *karmaONE finds exceptional candidates because we deliver referral rewards to the people who uncover the &quot;gems&quot; for us. Instead of hiring a headhunter, hire 1,000 of them through karmaONE.*

Very cool idea indeed.
