No food for now. I just wanted to buy a pizza at Aldi (local cheap super market) but descided to go later. I was in the shop but forgot that today is once again the day when Aldi sells a PC. These PCs are very good and very cheap. You are feeling as if you were in a war zone with the entire shop full of people. 256MB ram, 2Ghz Intel CPU, 80GB, DVD, CD-RW, Gefore4, Firewire, ... 1200 EUR. It's packed. :)
