The stuff us software people do is really really simple if you look at it. I mean we are not shipping any physical stuff. Or build physical stuff. Just think about the people that build high speed trains, power stations, aircraft carriers, ... . Ok, you get the idea. But this is all put in a totally new perspective when a software guy gets into the real world shipping business and cuts his packaging time down from 3 minutes to 35 seconds with fun software and hardware. Great stuff at [How to Ship Anything](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HowToShipAnything.html) by Joel on Software.
