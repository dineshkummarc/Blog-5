Now if that isn't cool!? [Legoland](http://www.lego.com/legoland/billund/Default.asp?locale=2057) has build one of the largest Wifi tracking Networks based on [this post on Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/articles/04/04/26/214256.shtml?tid=126&amp;tid=137&amp;tid=158&amp;tid=193&amp;tid=99). Based on their [announcement](http://www.lego.com/legoland/billund/whatsNew/default.asp?locale=2057), parents can have their kids wear a wrist band and if they loose the kid, they simply send an SMS from their mobile phone and get back the exact location of their kid. I wonder how long it will take for parents to just drop their kids of and let them wonder arround on their own, having the Legoland staff watch out for them and simply sending an SMS from time to time to see where they are. :)
