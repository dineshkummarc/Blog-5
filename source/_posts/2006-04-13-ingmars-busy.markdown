Check out [Ingmar's latest posting](http://bornholz.typepad.com/blog/2006/04/easter_update.html). The guy is busy and has some great projects that are starting to see the wild. Sitting with him in an office is always a joy and I am looking forward to the launch of [vloop.de](http://vloop.de/), which he just presented at Burda in Munich. I obviously can already see it, sitting in the office. And you can't. HA! :) 1:0 for me ;)
