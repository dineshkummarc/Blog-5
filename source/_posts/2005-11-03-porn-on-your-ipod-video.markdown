&lt;p&gt;Finally somebody has figured out how to make the iPod Video really useful... and as a result they are swamped. I am talking about [Guba](https://www.guba.com/), a usenet search engine. As we all know, Usenet is full of files, including an amazing amount of porn. The iPod Video does porn but requires mpeg4. This is where Guba comes in, who are not taking new accounts [at the moment](https://www.guba.com/noauth/signup.cgi). They will look through Usenet and re-render the videos so that they are landing on your iPod in good quality for you to enjoy on the train to work or home. :) &lt;/p&gt;
