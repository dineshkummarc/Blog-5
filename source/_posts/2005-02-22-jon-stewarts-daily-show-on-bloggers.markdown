Thanks to Oliver Wagner's [post](http://www.agenturblog.de/archives/2005/02/jon_stewart_abo.php) about it, I just found the video to &lt;a title=&quot;Jon Stewart's Daily Show on Bloggers&quot; href=&quot;http://homepage.mac.com/onegoodmove/movies/ds021605bloggers.html&quot;&gt;Jon Stewart's Daily Show on Bloggers from the 16th of this month. And boy is it fun to watch. It made me go back to blogging about it ... first rule of blogging ... don't blog about blogging ... damn. Missed that one now ;)
