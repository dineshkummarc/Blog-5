Now it's out, [Typepad Germany](http://www.typepad.de) has [opened its doors](http://www.typeblog.de/archiv/2004/07/typepad_goes_br.html) and adds another language/country to the list of available TypePad services world wide. I am really looking forward to see how it will be taken up. Even though there is a 60 day free special now, this is a pay service in the end, and it remains to be seen how many people are willing to do that in Germany, especially with so many free services. I am happily paying for TypePad at the moment, but I've been doing this for several years, this blogging thing, so it is part of my life and I have no problem paying. Congratulations to all those involved, best of luck.
