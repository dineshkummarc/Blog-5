If you are still in doubt that Wikipedia, a Wiki that everyone out there can edit and change around, can work, I suggest you check out Joi's post entitled &lt;a title=&quot;Wikipedia heals in 5 minutes&quot; href=&quot;http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/09/08/wikipedia_heals_in_5_minutes.html&quot;&gt;Wikipedia heals in 5 minutes&lt;/a&gt;. It links to a study (with an amazing graph by the way) from IBM about History Flow visualisation as they call it. What they did was analyse how long it takes for a deleted or greatly changed page in Wikipedia to be reactivated with the original correct one. The average is 5 minutes!!! Either you take it up, or you go back into your control world.

To quote General Shinseki: &quot;&lt;I&gt;If you don't like changge, you're going to like irrelevance even less.&lt;/I&gt;&quot;
