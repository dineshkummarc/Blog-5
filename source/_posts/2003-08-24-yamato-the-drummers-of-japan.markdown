I have just been to [Yamato - The drummers of Japan](http://www.wadaiko-yamato.com/) and I can only suggest to everyone to go there if you have the chance. I have played the drums so I am destined to like a group of quasi drummers, but this is amazing no matter what. When have you sat listening to drums for twice 45 minutes and totally forgetting the time. They have a great quote on their web site: 

&lt;I&gt;“If you’r looking for inspiring drumming and infectious dance rhythms, you’ll be disappointed. This is much, much more.” - The Guardian, London.&lt;/I&gt;

[Here](http://www.wadaiko-yamato.com/NewFiles/english-site/report-eu2003e/report-eu8e/8-main-e.htm)  you actually see them in Cologne, where I went to see them. Great theatre really and we'll have to watch out to catch some more interesting stuff there. I might get artsy in my old age ;)
