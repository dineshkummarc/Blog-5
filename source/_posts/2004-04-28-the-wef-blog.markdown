One of the best things about blogs is that they tend to open things up. This had become aparent when you suddenly saw people blogging about their sessions at Davos. [Loic le Meur](http://www.loiclemeur.com/) is trying to extend the trend (he even blogged videos from the blogging session at Davos) and has set up [The World Economic Forum Blog](http://wef.typepad.com/blog/). First of all, thanks Loic. Thanks for opening this world up for us. The thing is really that what is being discussed there is very very very important for the world we live in and while we might not have a direct say, we should know about it. The people sitting there are, at least to the most part, very intelligent and especially experienced human beings and don't just blabber out thoughts without thinking about it... a contradiction in itself in a sense. 

So I really suggest to get the [World Economic Forum Blog RSS Feed](http://wef.typepad.com/blog/index.rdf) and follow what is said on there. I can't say it enough. If you don't have anything to read RSS feeds yet, I suggest to bookmark [The World Economic Forum Blog](http://wef.typepad.com/blog/) for the next few days while they have some discussions at the [European Economic Summit of the World Economic Forum in Warsaw, Poland](http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/European+Economic+Summit+2004).

And [here is some more info](http://wef.typepad.com/blog/2004/04/welcome_to_the_.html) about the start of the blog and who are the two main bloggers currently filling the site. Have a good read.
