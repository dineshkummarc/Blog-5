I just confirmed the room for the 27.03.06 for our next [WebMontag in Cologne](http://www.webmontag.de/doku.php?id=koeln). This is were it started people so I am looking forward to some good presentation suggestions and a wonderful turnup. The new room is bigger and there are distributed seating spots available for closer chats. So go right over [here](http://www.webmontag.de/doku.php?id=koeln) and sign up.

If you want to sponsor the event, which really means a few beers, add it to the wiki or [contact me directly](http://thylmann.net/mail.php).
