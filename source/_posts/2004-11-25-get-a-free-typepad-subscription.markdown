TypePad is starting the holiday season with special reductions on all accounts and the option to give away TypePad accounts as presents. The cool part is though that I can now renew my pro account for a year, which I would likely have done anyway, but now I get it for less and a free account extra. The problem with this at the moment is that I for one don't know how to renew manually and second, I am not sure if I renewal will be with the cheaper prices. But I am on it and will update this when I know. :)

**Update**: More info will be posted on TypePad next week when the promotion starts.
