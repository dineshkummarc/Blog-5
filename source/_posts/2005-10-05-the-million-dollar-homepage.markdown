Now that's an idea that took off. Alex Tew set up [The Million Dollar Homepage](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/) as an idea to make money for going to university. The idea was to sell pixels on the homepage for $1 a pixel (actually the minimum is 100 pixels but ok). The site is now over 4 weeks old and he is well over $250.000 in sold pixels!!! Alexa lists him in the [movers and shakers](http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/movers_shakers?lang=en) at place 4, and actually says he is amount the top 1000 sites on the net now ([see here](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=p&amp;q=&amp;url=http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com)). Congratulations to Alex. Interesting idea that worked out.
