Yesterday I [talked to Bertrand Sereno](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/bertrand/diary/2004/06/8/), who does some very interesting stuff at the [Knowledge Management Institute at the Open University](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/). He's working on something called ClaimSpotter, which allows you to annote different works you read, letting others add their annotations, building a web of knowledge arround a documents, with links to the documents based on different things like what the document is about, or what it quotes or who quotes it. A good representation of what might come out of it can be seen in [this post](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/bertrand/diary/2004/06/6/).

He now sent me a link to HP's [Semantic Blogging Demonstrator](http://jena.hpl.hp.com:3030/blojsom-hp/blog/). This again links to Steve Cayzer's [Semnatic Blogging](http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2004/HPL-2004-48.html) report in the HP Labs Archive. Great stuff to read and very good to see HP going in that direction. This is very much something to watch.
