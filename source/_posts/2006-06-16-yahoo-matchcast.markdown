I am starting to become a fan of [Yahoo! Matchcast](http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/m/). Now that Heiko [posted about it](http://www.hebig.com/archives/003866.shtml) I finally need to post too. I have used it for a few days now and while it sometimes does not update correctly and still tells me there are 24 days to go until the first match (online until it finally connected), once it runs it runs well. the cool thing is that it also tells me who won previous matches of a future game. If you need a german ticker of what is happening in a game, go to tagesschau.de with your phone and select the live ticker. Best one out there. But to check general game statistics, see how the groups are performing, who is playing next and so on, simple get Matchcast for your Symbian mobile phone.
