Seems like I will not be able to give Apple my money for the living of my consumer music responsibility. I would have liked to try it out as the system looks very nice. But hey, that's how life goes when you are in Germany. While I am at it, I have a request for spammers. Stop sending me stuff that I can't use anyway damn it! I can't read chinese! I don't have a house. I don't feel fat. I don't need your latest 1000% in 2 days stock idea! Ok, that was that. Feeling better now.
