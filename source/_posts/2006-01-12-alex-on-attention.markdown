Alex Barnett has put down his [20 thoughts on Attention](http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/archive/2006/01/11/511690.aspx) and I thought I'd add a few points, because it is a very good list.

1. Yes there is nothing new in clickstreams, there is though in the idea that an independent party tracks those clickstreams and then shares it with third parties with your permission.
2. Clickstreams do not necessarily rely on cookies. If I have a tracker installed in my browser that logs every page I have seen, then I do not to have cookies enabled. Even on the server side, I can at least to a certain degree track clickstreams via referrers and data like IP, Browser, OS, Plugins, ... . This is about statistics anyway.
3. Totally agreed.
4. Value of attention data  ... this can be a lot higher than a few dollars a year, but yes, I think being in control is worth more than making money for example.
5. Agreed. Even though something else still has to be found to make people do that :)
6. :)
7. Agreed.
8. Agreed.
9. Agreed.
10. Agreed.
11. Agreed. And general wanting to do that is not a bad thing as such. Lock-in is a wonderful thing if it works. It will just likely not work so much in the future.
12. Agreed. Though many will not know the difference.
13. Not sure.
14. If I have multiple identities online, then I will only let one of those identities be logged. I would have likely created an other one because I don't want it to be connected to me.
15. I can feel what you mean... i think ;)
16. Possible.
17. Agreed.
18. Agreed.
19. Hmmm...
20. Wonderful list and the cool thing is, I can now get my tagcloud, wishlist, books bought, blogroll, contacts, buddy lists, photo collections, playlists, bookmarks, ... ... ... Is there somebody that will give me a system that will mine these together and get some interesting stuff out of it for me?
