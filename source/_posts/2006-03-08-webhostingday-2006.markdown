I just received an invitation to [WebhostingDay 2006](http://www.webhostingday.de/de/webhostingday.html) and it looks like a fun event. It's in taking place in [Phantasialand](http://www.phantasialand.de/intro.php) which will be closed for the day and only available to the crowd that goes to the event. There will be a party from ConneXion. Sounds interesting all in all. Registered. It makes perfect sense as it is pretty close to the data that we will be looking for a good hosting or co-location solution.
