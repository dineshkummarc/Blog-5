The [mighty David](http://hibiya.blogg.de/) just showed me his iTalk, with a stereo microphone. Of course he doesn't have an iPod, so we needed to ask a collegue (I forgot my iPod) to bring down his iPod Mini and you know what? It works!

The iPod Mini has recognized that it doesn't support the hardware ;) So ok, if you really want to know, it doesn't work. Grrr... but otherwise, this seems to be a really nice toy. And I am always amazed at how small the iPod Mini is too!

Oh, by the way, David will use this tool for an art exhibition... well actually, to produce what he will use. Very nice idea of which we will likely learn a lot more via his blog.
