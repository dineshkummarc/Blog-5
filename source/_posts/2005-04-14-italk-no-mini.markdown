&lt;p&gt;The [mighty David](http://hibiya.blogg.de/) just showed me his iTalk, with a stereo microphone. Of course he doesn't have an iPod, so we needed to ask a collegue (I forgot my iPod) to bring down his iPod Mini and you know what? It works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/italk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Italk&quot; /&gt;](http://owt.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/italk.jpg)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPod Mini has recognized that it doesn't support the hardware ;) So ok, if you really want to know, it doesn't work. Grrr... but otherwise, this seems to be a really nice toy. And I am always amazed at how small the iPod Mini is too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, by the way, David will use this tool for an art exhibition... well actually, to produce what he will use. Very nice idea of which we will likely learn a lot more via his blog.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;!-- more --&gt;
