Sixtus [posts about](http://www.sixtus.net/index/P226/) David Weinberger's [video blog post](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002909.html) about the convention bloggers in relation to a [recent CNet article](http://news.com.com/2010-1028-5289475.html?tag=nefd.acpro) that stated that they didn't live up to all the hype. As Sixtus says, it's great to watch and I agree with him that it is wonderful to take a look into David's work place :) But the reasoning is also very nice and gives further insight into what blogging is about. Little things make a difference might be a good term for it. It's not about having huge readerships but its about talking with your own voice, as is the really thing you can do when you want to do a blog really, and potentially attrackting some people and spreading an idea. The problem is that it's beyond control. The PR department can no longer try to press a certain kind of image about their company towards journalists, as somebody will see through it and post a counter view and if it is seen as correct it will spread. Welcome to the blogging world, where we talk about the things that really matter to us.
