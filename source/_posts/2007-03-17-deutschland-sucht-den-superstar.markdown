Deutschland sucht den Superstar, or DSDS in short, is the german equivalent to American Idol. After having been to a full show a few weeks ago, I now attended a final rehearsal. I am obviously biased, because my wife works at Grundy Light Entertainment, who run the show, but it is a cool thing to watch. Especially because seeing it in the studio is very different from TV, which I am not the only one to say. Having played drums and been to a recording studio with my bands twice, hearing the band play is great when listened to live.

This thirst for information and knowledge is actually what drives me in the direction I am in, culminating in the creation of Ormigo some time ago. The media landscape is an amazing thing, and seeing a little bit behind the curtains of one of the biggest shows in Germany, is really exciting. The amount of people working on this, and their dedication, are something that is truly educating. &lt;center&gt;[ title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/182/424081902_9db6ffdaf4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;17032007(001)&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;](http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliver/424081902/)&lt;/center&gt;In the studio they even have a [Spider Cam](http://www.spydercam.com/), which is great to watch as it zooms through the studio. Really congratulations for the entire team for running a great show.And to those that think I am a freak... this is entertainment people, and entertainment is there to entertain people and the show really does. People connect to those that are in the last rounds and that is not something that comes from nothing but is hard work. And trying to understand that, and letting yourself be entertained, is truly interesting.

This is really big, really expensive, and really profitable. Amazing. Especially for somebody having founded a company.
