Fred Wilson [posted about](http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/09/hackoffcom_a_mu.html) [Hackoff.com](http://www.hackoff.com/) and I did subscribe and read the first two chapters or episodes. The site is a blook (as they call it), meaning it's a book written in a blog. A murder mistery in a blog. Interesting system, with comments open, and it remains to be seen how much of a community builds around it. Reading it per RSS is easy enough and only takes a few minutes per post, but I for one am not sure if I will dive into the comments.
