I just found a very sumbering post in which Joi cites an email from a WSJ reporter. This one is from Iraq and how bad the situation is at this moment. While I do think that it is good the Saddam is gone, and think that it was wrong to invade Iraq, especially for the wrong reasons, I sadly have to say that there should not be full support from everyone out there to get the situation under control. This has happened. It was bad. It now is bad and needs to get better. The biggest problem here is that I have no clue how to make it better because force won't do it. Maybe a full force of the U.N., paid by the U.S., without involvement of anyone from the U.S., and a full removal of all troups from the U.S. (I hope you still follow the sentence ;)) would be something worth a try. Maybe. Possibly.
