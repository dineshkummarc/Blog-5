Today my first time was taken up because I visited [Frank Boosman's blog](http://www.boosman.com/blog/) with some great posts on the last few days providing some very interesting reading material. I highly recommend going to [Joi Ito's blog](http://joi.ito.com/) to read about the last conferences he was on. There are also some images of a party he hosted with some very interesting people just from looking at their names. 

The conference that is currently happening is called Supernova and you can find the group blog [here](http://192.246.69.113/). Just take a look at the list of attendants on the right. 

Interestingly Justin Hall wrote an article about mobile blogging shortly after I wrote mine. His is a lot deeper in the subject though. [nice read](http://www.thefeature.com/index.jsp?url=article.jsp?pageid=24815).
