Tags are all the rage at the moment and [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) has been one of the sites that have pushed it hard. Now they added a new features which they talked about [here](http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2004/10/new_features_ta.html), being tag relatedness. Because (I presume) many people will add several tags for their photos, Flickr knows which kind of tags relate to each other.  This opens up the amount of pictures you will find immensely. Really nice. I am starting to really think about whether all this taggy bit cannot be used in more places, where it currently is not imagined.
