It seems that GarageBand, which is part of the iLife package from [Apple](http://www.apple.com/), is getting very good reviews, at least based on the post &lt;a title=&quot;GarageBand in aller Munde&quot; href=&quot;http://fscklog.typepad.com/fsck/2004/01/garageband_in_a.html&quot;&gt;*GarageBand in aller Munde* on the german blog fscklog. Giving away the entire package of iLife at close to $50 does seem to be a very good deal, even though I still kind of consider iPhoto as part of MacOS X and do not believe the iApps should be charged seperately, at least not iTunes, iPhoto, and the like. If it gets really really high tech then maybe, but not for those. Based on the Reviews, GarageBand for $50 would be ok though.
