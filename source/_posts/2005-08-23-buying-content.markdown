You can either buy it in small numbers or you just buy a company that owns 575 print titles, which is what Google and Yahoo! seems to want to do based on [this Times Online UK article](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2095-1743192,00.html) (Source &lt;a title=&quot;John Battelle's Searchblog: Who Doesn't Want to Buy This Company?&quot; href=&quot;http://battellemedia.com/archives/001812.php&quot;&gt;John Battelle's Searchblog: Who Doesn't Want to Buy This Company?&lt;/a&gt;)

Content is still king and if you can monetize it automatically then this really rocks. So that's where Google's secondary offering around $4 billion will end up. Trader Classified Media seems to be worth $1.3 billion.
