JenSense is [reporting](http://www.jensense.com/archives/2006/06/new_adsense_ver.html) (with image) about the new vertical AdSense ad units that have images in them, or rather one image that seems to be added based on keyword to be related to the ads themselves. We did that ages ago when still working at [Ligatus](http://ligatus.de/). Good move.
