Why do some theories not seem to fit with every management job? This is really due to the complexity in management: No two management positions are alike. Problems can be bound (small and well defined) or unbound (large and poorly defined). Simon (1960) provided a good insight into the problem-solving process of managers:

-	Bounded rationality: We want to act rational but are unable to do so.
-	Satisficing: You want to do the best but settle for what is â€œgood enoughâ€?.
-	Types of decisions: Programmed decisions are repetitive and routine, unprogrammed are new and unstructured.

Another source of complexity is that you are accountable to so many people: the organisation, customers, colleagues, self.

You will be depending on a group and not only on yourself. You need to manage that group well and pay attention on group size (5-7 is good), group composition (similar=harmony,different=innovative), nature of tasks, resources, external recognition, task and process (tackle task and maintain social relationship), interaction patterns, motivation, group development.

You will have some task functions (proposing/initiating, building, diagnosing, giving and seeking, evaluating, decision making) and some process functions (gate keeping, encouraging, resolving conflict, giving feedback, dealing with feelings, looking after physical needs).

There are several states in group development: Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing. (Tuckman: 1965)

You will also be managing conflict of which there are several layers:

-	Misunderstandings
-	Differences in values and beliefs
-	Differences of interest and ambition
-	Interpersonal differences
-	Feelings and emotions

One thing you need to do is address the conflict and work towards a win-win solution (collaborating), which in many cases is very possible. This is a lot better then avoiding, accommodating or forcing a solution.

Once you have identified disagreements you need to do something about it either by non-intervention, prevention or resolutions.

One thing to remember is managerial opportunism(Williamson 1981) which means that you will want things for yourself, not the organisation. That is also part of the management reality and should be taken as such.

Networks are something you will need to build but you should pay attention that you are not in too many networks and that they are diverse groups of different people. Itâ€™s called Groupthink and will result in likewise thinking groups that make up unintelligent discussions.

To sum it up:

-	Everyone is political
-	Analyse yourself
-	Understand others
-	Listen and encourage
-	Explain
-	Match tasks to person
-	Put negative people in jobs where they do not pull others down
