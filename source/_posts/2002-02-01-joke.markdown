(translated from german)

A professor of medicine is holding a lecture for his first year students to introduce them to medicine. 

&quot;We will start with the basics of Autopsy. Two things are very important.

First: You have to overcome disgust. Look here ...&quot;

And he puts a finger into the ass of a dead man on the table, pulls out the finger puts it in his mouth.

&quot;And now you, one after the other!&quot;

With white faces each of the students go past the body. Once they are done the professor continues.

&quot;And second you need to sharpen your observation skills. I put the index finger in the man's ass and put my middle finger in my mouth.&quot;
