You always get these e-mails where you need to do a list of things and suddenly something amazing comes out of it? This one I got from TMF!


&lt;!-- more --&gt;


This is creepy!
(Start slowly scrolling down and follow instructions.)

.
.
.
.
.
.
Think of a letter between A and W
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Repeat it out loud as you scroll down.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Keep going... Don't stop...
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Think of an animal that begins with that letter
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Repeat it out loud as you scroll down.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Think of a man's/woman's name that begins with the last letter in the animals name
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Almost there..........
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Now count out the letters in that name on the fingers of the hand you are not using to scroll down.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Take the hand you counted with and hold it out in front of you at face level
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Look at your palm closely and notice the lines in your hand
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Do the lines take the form of the first letter in the persons name?
.
.
.
.
..
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Of course not.....
.
.
.
.
Now smack yourself in the head, get a life, and quit playing stupid e-mail games!
