Well, next week I am starting my residential school and at roughly 200 EURs per day the [hotel seems to look good](http://reservations.globalhotelfinders.com/hotel/10003904-11241474O.html?ses=cb7947d6574be05d22096ec5cbae77b747469) :) The hotel seems to improve in quality with the advanced courses. Looking forward to 4 days talking Strategy or rather ... Networking ;)
