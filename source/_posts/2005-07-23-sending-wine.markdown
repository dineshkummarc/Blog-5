Hugh from gapingvoid has started to send around &lt;a title=&quot;more bloggie goodness&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/001774.html&quot;&gt;more bloggie goodness, a new wine to be exact. Great stuff to get the word on a new wine out in the world. I [recently had](http://moblog.thylmann.net/2005/06/my_catch.html) a wonderful somelier evening and really loved some of the australian wine I tasted and am actually looking forward to trying out some african  ones in my trip to africa next week. Congratulations to Hugh for getting the world out on the new one he is promoting.
