Deep. &lt;I&gt;Abdullah, five, asks his father if Brandon and I &quot;parked our tanks next to our mothers.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;

Read more interesting stuff in the [Badgad Blog](http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/baghdad/) by several Berkley Students of Journalism who are now in Bagdad! Great read!
