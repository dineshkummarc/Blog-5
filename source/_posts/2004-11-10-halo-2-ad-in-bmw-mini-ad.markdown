&lt;p&gt;Ok, now this is cool. I just read ([ title=&quot;4Players.de ... Halo 2 Xbox&quot;&gt;4Players.de ... Halo 2 Xbox](http://www.4players.de/rendersite.php?LAYOUT=dispnews&amp;sid=&amp;newsid=36609&amp;SYSTEM=XBox)) that yesterday there&amp;nbsp; was a&amp;nbsp; new commercial for the BMW Mini and it suddenly had interference, an alien appeared,&amp;nbsp; said something in a weird language and then the commercial&amp;nbsp; went on. The alien was from Halo 2 for the Xbox and this was a planned &quot;Pirate Advertising&quot; that was ok'ed by BMW who also believe their Mini target group is on the weirder side. Very cool. I bow my head. The commercial video can be downloaded [here](http://www.4players.de/rendersite.php?LAYOUT=download_start&amp;sid=&amp;DOWNLOADID=7620&amp;SYSTEM=XBox&amp;STARTDOWNLOAD=1).&lt;/p&gt;
