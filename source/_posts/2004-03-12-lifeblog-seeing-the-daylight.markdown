Now should I have put this in the blogging category? Probably, but maybe not. Lifeblog is a Nokia based logging tool allowing you to kind of record your day. Get more information about it from the man himself, Christian Lindholm. [Lifeblog has seen the daylight](http://www.christianlindholm.com/christianlindholm/2004/03/lifeblog_has_se.html).
