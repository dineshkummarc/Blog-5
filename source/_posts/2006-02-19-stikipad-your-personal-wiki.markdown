I first heard about [Stikipad](http://stikipad.com/) via [Nico's post](http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=2508) about it. Always a guy to try out new stuff I headed over and really liked what I saw. I am starting to really like hosting my stuff with services and not having or allowing myself to play with my own installations. This tends to get a pain sooner or later and I don't want to handle backups and the like. If you look at the [Stikipad Feature List](http://www.stikipad.com/features/) you find out soon enough that it has most of what you need and the poweruser account you can even map your domain. So now, [wiki.thylmann.net](http://wiki.thylmann.net/) points to my Stikipad Scratchpad and I am having a good amount of fun with it. One of the best features is that accounts with  Stikipad, user account that is, are global to Stikipad and you can have lots of different blogs with the accounts. This might really turn out to be the perfect thing for a corporate blog in that you can split it up into teams and have it unique and special for those teams. I now have my main wiki, one on mobility that I might open up some more and a private one for my personal notes. I could do one for investors for [Ormigo](http://ormigo.com/) and more, and I do really like that.

If you are looking for a good wiki for your company, for your family or just for friends I really suggest trying it out. It's a very good bang for the buck and they will likely be adding some more cool features.
