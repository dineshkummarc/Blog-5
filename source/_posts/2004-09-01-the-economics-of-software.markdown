For all those working in software or not working in software... for all those, whoever those you want to be, ... Please read: [The Economics of Software](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/bmc/20040828#the_economics_of_software) to get an understanding of how software is priced or should be priced and what the dangers from Open Source are. As they author says, it's about lowering the FYO (Fuck You, Oracle) threshold. Read for yourself. It's highly suggested.
