The Family Tree companies are thinning in Germany with Verwandt most likely having won here. I just noticed that FamilyOne has increased their share capital by 77.550 EUR to 111.950 EURs and renamed themselves into Rumble Media GmbH, who are running [Fettspielen.de](http://www.fettspielen.de/).

I presume they raised another few hundred thousand or small 7 digit amount with the share capital increase, but you can obviously enlighten me, and just let FamilyOne run on the side now. This comes roughly a year after [Holtzbrinck Ventures invested](http://www.familyone.de/press/4) in the FamilyOne. They seem to be [looking for a Senior Manager for Operations](http://www.holtzbrinck.com/artikel/964042&amp;s=de) of the new part of the company. The online casual gaming market is hot at the moment with [Bigpoint having scored a major deal](http://www.bigpoint.net/index.es?action=press&amp;subpage=press_archiv&amp;newsID=130&amp;lang=de&amp;sid=05d45de948bdeb57871023a8826a4d7d) recently.
