Great post by Ross entitled &lt;a title=&quot;The Sales Learning Curve&quot; href=&quot;http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2004/10/the_sales_learn.html&quot;&gt;The Sales Learning Curve.  First of all the learning he talks about is very important. You need good people that are not afraid to learn and especially to unlearn, which is a lot harder than learning. What I also like and am really thinking about a lot at the moment is setting up a blog/wiki where all communications are BCC'd. You won't loose anything anymore, everybody can learn, everybody can comment. Of course it is also risky in terms of people not being sure if they can say something stupid, and oh you will, but you will need to be secure in yourself and in the company that nobody will make fun of it but that there will be constructive suggestions.
