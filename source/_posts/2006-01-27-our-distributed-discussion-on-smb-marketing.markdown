&lt;p&gt;As Bud said in his post entitled [The Internet Value Proposition](http://thecommunityengine.com/home/archives/2006/01/small_business.html#more), we are having a good discussion together about marketing and things for SMBs. Let me look at one of the latest points of Bud:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most small business people do not have the time to do what it takes to build a site that will do well in organic search results.  In a largely service economy, their economic engine is driven by meeting people and physically rendering service.  The Internet, telephones, etc. just serve the purpose of making that happen.  In other words, the Internet is ancillary, not an end in and of itself.
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, exactly. Sadly he falls back in the next bit in saying that they should outsource their SEO/SEM. What he says above though is that SMBs are driven by the fact that once they have a customer contact, they make that contact into a long time customer. That's their business. So what do they need? A customer contact! Not a web site. Not some agency that optimizes their site for placements. They need a qualified customer contact delivered right to their doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, that's the business [Ormigo](http://ormigo.com/) is in, the company I just co-founded. We are still in the financing stage if anyone else is interested. :)&lt;/p&gt;
