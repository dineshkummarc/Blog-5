Yesterday, after Avonia's shift ended at 23:30, we went out to a pub with some of the hotel people to get a drink as we often do. This time, right next to us, were two guests. To guys from Saudi-Arabia, who paid for everything. They are two of those oil people, being in Germany because their mother had some operation here. They were dressed in western style and it was a fun evening, oh what stories.

We got started talking about casinos based on my talks with Hans yesterday and he started raving about his experience. First of all, never go in to win but go in to have some fun, just take $3000 dollars or whatever and plan to loose them. ;)

He did this in Egypt (Cairo) he said and was loosing a few thousand each night for two weeks, then on his last day he was in one casino and after loosing $800 he put $100 on 17 and won. So he just took out the $100 again and let the rest there, 17 won again, he went out with about $17000, on to the next casino, won again (always telling us the hotel names where he was to play, many of them have a casino). He went to like 5 of them and ended up winning over $200.000. The last hotel he was in, where he won $70.000 was the Inter-Continental Samiramis. Interestingly enough, Avonia and me stayed there when we have been in Cairo this year. The Samiramis does not have a Casino ;) It was a very fun story though and I was told that you can really believe most what he said, at least in the hights of money he is loosing and playing with. Juan, one of the hotel guys, talked to them a bit more about when they were in Spain, where he lived, and it seems that they really knew a lot about those places again and he knew those folks from back there and there are nights when they just treat lots of people for a few drinks.

A very fun evening indeed and I was almost dragged to go shopping for a laptop with the other (a little dumb, as agreed by everybody there) guy of the two. He just lost his digital camera and passport (with $1000 in it his gf said ... $200 in it he said a few hours later ;)). When they went out around 2, he almost forgot his mobile phone on the table ;)

Tomorrow we will go to the pub again, around 12:30. 13:30, the german football match starts, live over huge TV screens in the pub. Maybe we'll get another 8:0 again. :) 

There is a store chain here in Germany that said at the beginning of the world championships that that they would reduce their prices by 5% 2 days after the game for every goal the german team has in a game. On one product line that is. Well, they were bought empty this time, with 40% reduction, but hey, that's advertisement that they would not have been able to pay for.
