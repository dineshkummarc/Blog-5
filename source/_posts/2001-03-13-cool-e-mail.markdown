Just read an article on fastcompany.com about a very cool e-mail. Seems like the statistics represented in there are roughly correct. Very insightful. 

If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely 100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same, it would look something like the following. There would be: 

57 Asians
21 Europeans; 14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
8 Africans
52 would be female
48 would be male
70 would be non-white
30 would be white
70 would be non-Christian
30 would be Christian
89 would be heterosexual
11 would be homosexual
6 people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth and all 6 would be from the United States.
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
1 ( yes, only 1 ) would have a college education
1 would own a computer


When one considers our world from such a compressed perspective, the need for both acceptance, understanding and education becomes glaringly apparent. 

Something to think about.
