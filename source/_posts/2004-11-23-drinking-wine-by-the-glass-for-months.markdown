&lt;p&gt;(Comment: TypePad's new WYSIWYG editor seems to be eating my conent. When you see a &lt;I&gt;Link: blah&lt;/I&gt; post, it's just a post having been eaten, so here I go again.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Business 2.0 Blog has a great post entitled [World's Smartest Wine Bar](http://business2.blogs.com/business2blog/2004/11/worlds_smartest.html) showing us how you can drink wine by the glass for months from 16 bottles. The idea is that you have the bottles mounted to the $20.000 system and get out a glass each time. Then the bottle is filled with argon to keep it from oxidating. Even white wine seems to last for 2 months, so red wine possibly longer. For 16 bottles this should be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do love wine and do love to have a glass in the evening but you can't just let the bottle stand somewhere for ages. As a small tipp though, you can put a full glass in the kitchen over night and the way the wine tasts the next morning is similar to how it would taste if it were to age in the bottle in the cellar for a year. This is just due to the different of oxidation in the closed bottle or the glass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd love to have a wine cellar with this thing in the middle being my lovely wine dispenser. Sadly I neither have $20.000 to spend on a wine dispenser nor $200.000 on a good wine celler with wine. :)&lt;/p&gt;
