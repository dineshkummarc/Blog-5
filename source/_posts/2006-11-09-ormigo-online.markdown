I wanted to wait for a quiet period for writing a bit about our launch, but as this is very likely not to happen, I am just writing a few notes now. As said, [Ormigo](http://ormigo.com/) launched last week and things are going very well indeed. What we are doing, in very short, is allowing local merchants to have access to new customers that inform themselves about products they sell online. The entire system is focussed on products or services that are not sold via an impulse buy, but where you have to or want to talk to a real person before making a decision.

As it is currently still focussed on creating demand from local merchants for different products (financial products in germany first), there is not a lot for the general internet user to do. This being more of a B2B service this is even likely not to change too much in the near future.

Thanks to the great team have have assembled, launching went smoothly and we are already well into the next sprint for another part of the system which will focus more on the user side of things. But with this, I'll finish and go back to work for another period of light blogging. :)
