Well, it seems that I will have to get up at 4 am today to get my character walking the longer route. I have to be at the destination tomorrow at 12 and this route will give me 4x60 points extra which would be a good thing I think.

I find it amazing though that I even think about getting up in the middle of the night just to move a character around :)
