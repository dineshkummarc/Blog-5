Looking at meeting some bloggers? Want to hear what Nokia has to say about the field? Both things I'd love to do but sadly can't. If you want to you should check out the Six Apart Meeting in Berlin on the 10th of this month. Yes, that's tomorrow. Details are [here](http://www.sixapart.de/archiv/2005/02/six_apart_in_be.html) and you can add your name [here to the wiki](http://www.socialtext.net/loicwiki/index.cgi?berlin_europablog) in case you are coming. Have fun everyone!

**Update:** Change in plans. I will be there. :)
