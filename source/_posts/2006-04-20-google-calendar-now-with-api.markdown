Paul just [linked to](http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2006/04/18/google_calendar_5.html) the URL for the specs of the [Google Calendar API](http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/calendar.html) and this ads another level to a service I am already starting to really like. If Google would just let me in to the Google Hosted eMail Service things would start to be close to perfect.

What I would like people to do now is build little apps for iCal and Outlook to add events that where added in iCal (or Outlook) to a Google Calendar. Then we would have quasi syncing. An automatic daily import of my iCal file would be good but that does not seem to be available via the API. So one would need to somehow watch what is done in iCal and automatically add things in the background. Because syncing is one of the only features that are missing really. Syncing via SyncML from a mobile phone would be good too.
