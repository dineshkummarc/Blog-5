Am I in the UK at the right time or not? I just arrived in Milton Hill House near Oxford for three days of talking finacial management as part of the OUBS Finance course for the MBA and was already happy that the hotel has a business center with free internet access. This is nice. But then, I saw a nice flyer at the reception saying that BT Openyone is hosting a wireless broadband week from january 26th until February 1st, meaning that you can surf at the BT Openzone Wifi hotspots for free, and there are 2000 of them in the UK. 

Ah well I thought, that's nice, not that there will be a BT hotspot out here in nowhere land but I figured I'd ask. And you know what? There is a BT Openzone hotspot right here at the bar area, all free, all powerful and there for the taking for the entire time of my stay, which is until February 1st. :) My luck.

I just posted some pics of the trip via the mobile phone to the [Moblog](http://owt.typepad.com/moblog/) but now I will be able to just sync them over to the laptop and post them like that, making it a lot cheaper. Free Wifi rocks!
