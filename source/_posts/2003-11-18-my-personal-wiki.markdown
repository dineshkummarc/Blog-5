I have finally found a Wiki that is easy to install, maintain, understand and manage. A Wiki you wonder? One of the biggest Wiki's out there is [WikiPedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/) and they define a Wiki as this:

&lt;I&gt;A WikiWikiWeb enables documents to be authored collectively in a simple markup language using a web browser. Because most wikis are web-based, the term &quot;wiki&quot; is usually sufficient. A single page in a wiki is referred to as a &quot;wiki page&quot;, while the entire body of pages, which are usually highly interconnected, is called &quot;the wiki&quot;.

&quot;Wiki wiki&quot; means &quot;fast&quot; in the Hawaiian language, and it is the speed of creating and updating pages that is one of the defining aspects of wiki technology. Generally, there is no prior review before modifications are accepted, and most wikis are open to the general public or at least to all persons who also have access to the wiki server. In fact, even registration of a user account is not often required.&lt;/I&gt; ([more](http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki))

I really like the concept of anyone being able to edit it and there might be some interesting things coming out of it over time. It's open for anyone to work on and I will be trying to build some main categories of interest into it in the next few days. I might then close down the index page to be able to filter a little bit what will end up in there. I obviously don't expect hundreds of people to go wild in build thousands of pages, but it can be said to be a nice social study to see who does what to which part in the future. It might take months or more for anyhting substantial to happen but what will this entire thing be like in a few years. I don't know and I want to find out, which is why it is included in the main site menu.

If anyone is interested to find out when something is updated, there is an RSS feed that can be subscribed to, which I am doing via [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/).  In a sense, you can now even publicly contact me via the wiki. It can also be a way to set up meetings, like Joi Ito did for a [dinner meeting in San Francisco](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/DinnerSanFranNov11) recently. I will have to see whether it is possible for the RSS feed to be for distinct pages, that way you can monitor your own personal page or a dinner meeting or a wish list or whatever you want to enter. Good stuff all in all. Welcome [My Personal Wiki](/wiki/).
