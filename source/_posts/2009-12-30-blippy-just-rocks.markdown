Boy do I love [Blippy](http://blippy.com/)! Seldom has there been a service where I am so pissed that internationalization is hard. The thing is the only account I have that works with the service is my Amazon.com Kindle account. Even iTunes doesn't work as it is the German one. If you are unfamiliar with Blippy read [this intro on Techcrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/22/blippy-invites/) as well as the follow up where Blippy announces [tracking $1 million in transactions only one day after opening their doors](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/23/blippy-1-million/). People are already talking about [Blippy being the next Twitter](http://robbrown.posterous.com/blippy-is-this-the-evolution-of-twitter), which is really mostly to mean that the Twitter idea is starting to be so big that it can be split up into more tiny niches, with Blippy being one.Many people will wonder why Blippy is so good or why anyone would share all this information about themselves and I suggest, just read the stream by [Leo Laporte](http://blippy.com/leolaporte) or [Matt Cutts](http://blippy.com/matt) or [Jason Calacanis](http://blippy.com/jason) (who recently purchased a Canon 7d by the way) or [Philip Kaplan](http://blippy.com/pud) one of the founders.For all their credit card stuff they are using [Yodlee](http://yodlee.com/) as do most of the other things out there that interact with US bank accounts. Sadly I do not know of any such service in Germany at this time. Might be somebody that should do this but I am unsure about the German privacy laws. To finish it off [here is a video interview with Pud (Philip Kaplan)](http://kara.allthingsd.com/20091223/philip-pud-kaplan-talks-about-blippy-the-twitter-of/). He also founded Fucked Company and Adbrite by the way. With Adbrite being so well copied all over Germany I see now reason why this will not happen soon here in Germany for Blippy, expect we don't have Yodlee.Actually I hope somebody will start a Yodlee in Germany and give the account access to Blippy so we keep it integrated!**Update:** and just now they twittered about international support for iTunes. Germany was missing but added minutes after me telling them. Congratulations! So blippy went international in 2009! cool :)
