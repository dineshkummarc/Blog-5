I've been writing a bit about click fraud in recent times and now Robin Good wrote a nice &lt;a title=&quot;Is Click Fraud The Biggest Threat To Independent Publishers' Future? - Robin Good's Latest News&quot; href=&quot;http://www.masternewmedia.org/news/2004/12/06/clickbots_is_click_fraud_the.htm&quot;&gt;article about the subject matter giving a bit more information on clickbots too. Especially the fact that there are some people out there that use clickbots and make big amounts of money with the help of them is very interesting. I figured as much though. Another use of clickbots though is also to get your top competitors on your keywords out. You just click them dry if you want. Then I get the top spot and that for less money. Oh the joy, theoretically.

But this is a real problem and even though mathematics might help a bit it will get especially hard with small sites or new sites that just start out at a given level. But there my math skills are just not high enough to really know if some analysis will tell you exactly how many clicks are fake. 

But yes, Robin is right that this click model will be taken over by some other method of advertising in the future and one that will be less prone to fraud. Already on it Robin, already on it. :)
