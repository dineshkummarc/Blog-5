I just ordered the [Sony  DVP-NS330](http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008IM88/) DVD Player in black from Amazon.de in Germany. Or rather, I ordered it yesterday (sunday) arround 1800. Now, at 00:21 on Monday, the price increased from 99 EURs to 129 EURs. /me pats himself on the back for a timely good buy ;) I likely have to write down that Amazon.de changes prices arround midnight.
