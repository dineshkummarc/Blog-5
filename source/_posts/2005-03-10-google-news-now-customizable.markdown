&lt;a title=&quot;Google News&quot; href=&quot;http://news.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google News&lt;/a&gt; has been updated and you can now customize it. A great example of a little Ajax magic, moving things around effortlessly. The nice one is that you can also put searches on there. So you can put a search for your name on the top left and get all the news about yourself. Very nice.
