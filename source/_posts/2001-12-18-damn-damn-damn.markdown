Ok, so I read Scot's article:

http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=421

It's about his move from BeOS to MacOS X more or less. Long and very detailed and a wonderful read. 

For today, I will put Scot on my hate list (sorry Scot ;)). Why? Recently I was kind of happy again with my decision to go with Windows for now, mostly because of price. Now, I am back thinking that I need a Mac! Damn! Damn! Damn! I am too easily influenced and Scot is too good of a writer.

Ah well. It's not like it's a real problem.
