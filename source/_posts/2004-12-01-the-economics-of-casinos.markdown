TJ links to [a post](http://www.gambling-weblog.com/archives/ever_wonder_how_much_a_casino_makes.html) by Creative Weblogging's new Gambling Weblog in one of his [latest posts](http://www.tjacobi.com/archives/the_gambling_economics.html) giving some detail on the economics behind casinos. The interesting part is that they make 180 to 200 euros of profit per customer per day with 900,000 customers in 2003. That's a profit of 540,000 euros per day! Not bad ey? Makes me remember a [post of mine](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2001/07/data_mining_at_.html) about casinos and their data mining efforts. The MGM Mirage in Las Vegas has 6TB of data on their 9 million customers. The system supports their $138,889 of revenue per hour. :)
