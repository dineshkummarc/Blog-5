I recently [posted about 21Publish](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/09/21publish_is_go.html) and already hinted that Blogg.de was also available on some basis. Well now [Nico](http://www.lumma.de/) has [posted](http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=697) about [Bloggware](http://www.bloggware.de/), the site that is used for them to sell their ASP solution. Think of blogg.de as a case study. The very nice thing I find is that they are billing in CPM values, e.g. â‚¬0.5 to start with. This is a very cool price if you want to build a big blogging community, especially as you just have to think what kind of CPM you think you can earn and then start building. Good move Nico!
