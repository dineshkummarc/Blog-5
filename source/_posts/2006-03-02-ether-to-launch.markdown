Techcrunch is reporting that [Super-Stealth Ether is to Launch Tonight](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/01/super-stealth-ether-to-launch-tonight/), which is part of [Ingenio](http://paypercall.ingenio.com/default.aspx), the pay-per-call people. Actually this seems to be very similar to a German company called [Questico](http://www.questico.de/), which has started doing this kind of stuff years ago. The problem is that they never really succeeded and are now only doing horoscopes and things like that. It's be interesting to see what Ether makes of it.
