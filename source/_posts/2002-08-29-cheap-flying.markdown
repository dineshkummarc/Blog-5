I just bought my ticket to London for the Open University Residential School in September. It will take place near London from the 20th to the 22nd of September and looks like it will be very interesting. I already have a 60 page report about an ice cream company here that will be used for a case study. But to get back to the flying part. 118 EURs for the two way ticket. I am amazed how cheap this stuff is getting. I mean arround 40 EURs of that is airport taxes. So the real ticket is arround 70 EUR. 35 EUR per one-way. If you then think about how many hundred EURs you would otherwise have spent ... you really have to wonder how much profit they earlier made. And at the same time these airlines are making huge losses. This really makes me wonder.
