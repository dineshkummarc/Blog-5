[Jeremy](http://www.ensight.org/) started off with the idea of starting a blogging magazine and this is where this lead. There is no a real site about it and it is starting to get some real feedback. Of course, launching a real magazin is not an easy task but this might be working, or at least something that will end up being very similar. I suggest you go on over there and take part in the discussion. Everyone is welcome to post or comment. I have been trying to get my voice heard several times already when this thing started and I think more voices need to be heard.
