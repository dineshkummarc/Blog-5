This is a case study about Weatherfield Community Services, a non-profit organisation that provides meals and home-help services for the elderly in their own homes. They got a new accountant and all really seemed fine. Then the company financials suddenly deteriorated. There are some things that one should be looking at when looking at the financials of a company.


&lt;!-- more --&gt;


1.	Look at the rate of expansion in different areas
2.	Calculate ROCE = surplus / average of opening and closing accumulated fund balanced
3.	Look at cash-flow and look at potential problems in management of long and short-term dept/overdrafts. 
4.	Look for out of the ordinary expense increases in relation to income/orders
5.	Calculated use of fixed assets via turnover ratios = total annual incoming resources / Annual average fixed assets
6.	Look at working capital 
7.	Look at debtors/creditors situation

Some interesting things that came up in this case study:
-	when expanding, donâ€™t use an overdraft but get long-term loans for long-term investments
-	even though you are profitable, you might be a take over target with a bad financial status

Questions you always need to ask: How did this happen? How will it not happen again?
