Ok, stuff is getting a little bit clearer, and more scary. First of all, John has [linked to](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000644.php) an [XLS file of Google's financials](http://battellemedia.com/archives/Google%20Model%2005.01.04.xls) done by [Corey Johnson](http://www.nbccableinfo.com/insidenbccable/networks/cnbc/prog/people/johnson.html). 

A very interesting bit came up in the comments to his post though. Saul Hansell pointed the following bit out from the S-1 filing:

&lt;I&gt;The Company's net revenues and cost of revenues would both have been $91.7 million and $504.0 million and $69.7 million and $262.6 million higher in 2002 and 2003, and in the three months ended March 31, 2003 and 2004, if these AdSense agreements had been accounted for on a gross basis. There were no AdSense agreements in 2001.&lt;/I&gt;

This means that google is reporting only the revenues available to them, not those paid out to others. Now this got me thinking a little bit. As I just [furled](http://www.furl.net/), there is some discussion about [revenue shares from AdSense](http://www.seroundtable.com/archives/000415.html) which might be in the high 70% for the partners. 

Let's look at the numbers above again. But first lets look at something else. 

&lt;I&gt;We provide advertising, web search and other services to members of our Google Network. The net revenues generated from the fees advertisers pay us when users click on ads that we have delivered to our Google Network membersâ€™ web sites represented approximately 15% of our net revenues in 2003, and approximately 21% of our net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2004, and we expect this percentage to increase in the future.&lt;/I&gt;

Let's take the March 31, 2004 numbers. Of the &lt;i&gt;net&lt;/i&gt; revenues 21% came from partners. 95% of their revenues were from advertising. That's about $370 Million. 21% of that is from AdSense partners. This means $292 Million comes from Google's own sites. That's $78 Million. As stated above by Saul, to get real revenues we need to add back $263 Million. That's a total via AdSense of $341 Million.

This gives us totally different numbers:
1. Google Pockets roughly 23% of their revenue via AdSense, payout out 77% to partners. I presume that some of the big ones get more than that and the normal AdSense pulls that down a bit again.
2. 54% of Google's Revenue come from AdSense. This really means that 54% of the power that Advertisers pay for, currently comes in via AdSense. This is likely to grow.
3. 41% of their revenue is paid out to partners. And with the above revenue share, this will grow, presumeing AdSense growths faster than Google sites.

Some very interesting numbers I have to say.
