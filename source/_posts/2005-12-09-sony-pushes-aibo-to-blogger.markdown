Nico is the lucky one that now calls [Rootkit](http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=2325) his own. Rootkit is not what you expect  though, because Rootkit is a dog, an artificial dog, with a bit of AI and a bit of [nocat](http://wiki.thylmann.net/Main/Nocat). When Nico was in Paris at Les Blogs his phone rang, and the agency from Sony was on the line given the all clear that he would receive his Aibo! It seems that there would be one blogger in Germany that would be able to play with it for two months and blog about it. I think they chose the perfect target and the little puppy now has a new home inside the New Media Management offices and I am looking forward to seeing Rootkit moblog. Rootkit seems to have both a camera and wireless lan. looking forward to it.
