Where will you host your next web site? Might as well be Google! At least if you follow the reasoning by John Battelle [here](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000653.php). Google last month bought [Ignite Logic](http://www.ignitelogic.com/index.php), a company that allows law firms to easily set up web sites. I think they just made AdWords survivable. Hmmmm.....

&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: Ah well. [ignitelogic.com](http://www.ignitelogic.com/) now only serves an image. Nothing more. The php file linked above gives a server error. This might be a temporary problem or Google didn't want us to know what they are doing.
