PalmDesktop seems to work fine with my Visor, even though some people said that there are some problems with it and Handspring advises against using it. One thing that might be needed is that you should remove the latest Palm Software update from the Palm directory.

Having done that I could import (via export to tab file in palmdesktop) my addresses to Entourage. Wonderful. Now I have those in there and am reasonably happy until the direct syncronization with Entourage comes out, hopefully soon.

I won't import any other stuff as I can work with those from Palm which is ok. 

iJournal is a very nice client by the way and I hope to be posting a bit more now also a bit more public even though I am more or less using this as communicating with the world at large only. It's directly on the homepage which means I don't want to put everything there, even though some might disagree ;)
