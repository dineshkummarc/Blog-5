Fellow Corante Web Hub member Pete Cashmore [posted more](http://mashable.com/2006/02/12/edgeio-mikes-little-ebay-killer/) about [Edgeio](http://www.edgeio.com/) and this thing really looks nice. The general idea is to build a [Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.com/) by aggregating appropriate posts from blogs all over the world. Very nice indeed. I posted about [this and structured blogging](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/12/structuredblogg.html) some time ago and have some thoughts running around here at [Ormigo](http://ormigo.com/) around similar ideas. I think Edgeio is on to something and this can really develop nicely in the future.
