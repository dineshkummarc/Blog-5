It's really starting to feel like Microsoft has not only understood the blogging thing, but also has a pretty interesting culture inside the corporation. One would imagine that starting a blog about recruitment for technical positions inside Microsoft would be a new move and would at least be known and checked out by the some VP or something similar. Seems like it wasn't. This is obvious from [this post](http://weblogs.asp.net/jobsblog/archive/2004/03/27/100493.aspx) from the *Technical Positions @ Microsoft* blog, which also links to an interesting post on Robert Scoble's blog Re a reply by a VP to one of his posts.





There are two things at play here though. One is that Microsoft has a very open idea about blogging, even having [Dave Winer speak about blogging](http://www.ensight.org/archives/2004/03/24/blogging_isnt_conversational.html) and they do allow their employees to blog freely, with the only limitation being that they can't talk about anything that isn't public within Microsoft yet if I remember correctly, which is really ok ;). So the HR Blog was really started by two people within the group and that's that.

Second, this is just the way Microsoft seems to be doing things, being big but splitting everything up in small little teams that are pretty free to do what they need to do to achieve their goals. This sounds logical but is actually very hard to do within a company and you also need the right people to get it going.

**Update:** And it seems that Microsoft will launch Blogbot soon, a blog search engine. [Read the story on Yahoo!](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/pcworld/20040327/tc_pcworld/115416)
