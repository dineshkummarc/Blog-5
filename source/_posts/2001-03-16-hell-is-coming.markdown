Server move is starting.

We need to move all e-mail and www to another server. Ship the mail and web server to a new location and then sell the other two servers and move all of their stuff to the new server. Wonderful. The party is starting.

Sendmail sucks (dmail rules! :)) and I need to set up sendmail to take over mail for a few days from the mail server. Grrr.... this will be  fun. Somebody remind me why I am doing an MBA?!?!? :)

Party time.
