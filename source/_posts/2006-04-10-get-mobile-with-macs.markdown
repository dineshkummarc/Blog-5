I am very happy to see that O2 in Germany has started [mobile-macs.de](http://www.mobile-macs.de/), a blog and wiki about how to get your mac online via GPRS, UMTS or WLAN. It's really getting filled with info and I am happy to hear that they really want to open it up to other providers than O2 making it a real goto site for mobile mac users. So go over there and [check it out](http://www.mobile-macs.de/). Nice design and implementation thanks to [GoJou](http://www.gojou.com/).
