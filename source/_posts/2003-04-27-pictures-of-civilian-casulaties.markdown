Having returned from my holiday, I am going over some blogs and Scot Hacker's &lt;a title=&quot;birdhouse.org&quot; href=&quot;http://www.birdhouse.org/blog/&quot;&gt;birdhouse.org&lt;/a&gt; has an interesting post entitled [lucky](http://birdhouse.org/blog/archives/000804.php). Two interesting links from there. For one, [these pictures](http://www.robert-fisk.com/iraqwarvictims_mar2003.htm) are of civilian casualties in Irak. No, we didn't see those on TV. The second one is an [Iraq War Justification flowchart](http://www.megnut.com/images/iraq_war_flow.jpg) by megnut. Still trying to keep an open mind here.
