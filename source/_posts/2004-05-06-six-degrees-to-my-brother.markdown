I just signed up to my [OpenBC](http://www.openbc.de/) another social networking service, but this one is in Germany and I just thought I'd give it a try as it is just floating arround. [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) is better, [Orkut](http://www.orkut.com/) more fun. But there is one great thing about OpenBC. I have one contact at the moment, from inside the company, and then to somebody else inside the company, somebody that worked here previously, on to somebody else I never heard about, to somebody that my brother went to school with, to ... tarraaaataaataaaaa my brother. Now isn't that cool? :)
