Now that's how you launch a company. Take ex-Apple CEO Gilbert Amelio, co-founder Steve Wozniak and ex-Exodus CEO Ellen Hancock and have them launch a company. They don't even need to know what they are doing, you just want to use their network, because the IPO comes with the company founding and you raise $150 Million for the three to buy any company out there. That's a SPAC (special purpose acquisition corporation) we have here. I first heard about them doing this in a recent [TWiT](http://twit.tv/) episode where woz was attending. Now more has come to light via the Mercury News. So check it out: [MercuryNews.com | 03/15/2006 | Ex-Apple executives seek tech properties to acquire](http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/technology/14104314.htm).

**Update**: Techdirt has [more](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060315/1133233.shtml) on  their compensation from the [sec filing](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1337675/000095014905000576/f11842sv1.htm#103).
