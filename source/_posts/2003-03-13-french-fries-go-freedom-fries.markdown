I already read this yesterday here in Germany and now this morning I found it on my Avango Channel of Business Week Online. [Will &quot;French Kiss&quot; Be Next to Go?](http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/mar2003/nf20030313_7075_db015.htm)

The US is making themselves into laughing stock (or however the saying goes). Really. Come on! Snack bars and restaurants run by the House of Representatives, now no longer call french fries french fries but freedom fries. That's abviously because the French are so evil in not letting the US have their way. 

What Richard S. Dunham notices niceley is that &quot;*Hey gents, French fries aren't even French. They originated in Belgium. It was the Americans that incorrectly attached the French to the fries in the first place.*&quot;

And at the end of the story he notes: *Of course, it's a lot easier to personally attack someone who disagrees with you rather than to reason together. That's something politicians in both parties have been doing for years. Representative Jones said it well when he noted that the &quot;self-serving politics of passive aggression in this effort has discouraged me more than I can say.&quot; He was talking about the French. But congressman, you might want to take a good look in the mirror. *
