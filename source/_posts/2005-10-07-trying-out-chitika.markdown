There is a new play in the contextual advertising town called [Chitika](http://www.chitika.com/) that seems to be working really well, at least it is [paying Jeremy well](http://www.ensight.org/archives/2005/10/06/chitika-eminimalls-review/). I just signed up and put it on my site to see how it works out. A nice thing with this one is that you can target keywords directly. You can kind of sell products without careing about where the product is linked to. Great stuff. [Here](https://chitika.com/faqs.php) is how you do it:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

*Can I set my own keywords and products instead of contextually targeting products?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes. By default, the products are contextually targeted to your content. If you'd like to set your own query or product, we can do so by specifying it in ch_query javascript param. For example, to target the &quot;canon powershot&quot; camera you would add this line to the javascript code:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
ch_query = &quot;canon powershot&quot;;*
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One thing I could sell you is my new digital camera, the Canon EOS 350D, an amazing digital slr! Check it out:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
