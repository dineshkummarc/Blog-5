&lt;p&gt;Good day everyone and welcome on the new home of my blog! I moved everything over to [Squarespace ](http://www.squarespace.com/?associateTag=olivert)after being brainwashed over weeks by [TWiT](http://twit.tv). :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that the system is really nice, even though I still have a small problem with importing my old entries into the blog (new lines get lost but can be revived through a short edit). This is supposed to be fixed in the next two weeks. Customer care by them has been amazing with questions answered mostly within minutes. Another item is that I still need to use friendfeed as a lifestream system for the homepage, but it seems that lifestreaming is coming in due time, currently in [beta testing](http://esquareda.com/lifestream/). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to get rid of managing my own server even though I loose the opportunity to play with a lot of fun stuff ... which might be good anyway, you know time and all. This new site will hold an aggregated stream on the frontpage (once out of beta or me in the beta ;)), my blog, a short about me, contact information as well as a private section for family which is very easy to set up on Squarespace. This actually covers all I need from my system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem was changes in URL structure but I hacked together a small PHP Script that is now handing over permanent redirects to search engines to the new urls which was easy enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to more interesting things from Squarespace (i.e. iPhone app :)) and talk to you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
