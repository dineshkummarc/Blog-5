The wonderful David Weeks has contacted me again in relation to some further stuff about creativity he has put on his web site. I have just been a bit slow (almost a month ;)) to post about it. Sorry everyone. What he did was create an on-line creativity techniques notebook called &lt;a title=&quot;Solve that Problem&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mental.athletics.dsl.pipex.com/solveit/titlepage.htm&quot;&gt;Solve that Problem. Nice url to keep handy.
