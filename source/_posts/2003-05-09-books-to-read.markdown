I already have way too many books on my [Amazon.de Wishlist](http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/registry/wishlist/028-0129873-7234170), but I will likely have to add more (just did with A Tipping Point) from &lt;a title=&quot;onfocus.com : Weblog BookWatch&quot; href=&quot;http://www.onfocus.com/bookwatch/&quot;&gt;onfocus.com : Weblog BookWatch&lt;/a&gt;. They just look at what people link to at the moment on their blogs and then ... voila, you have a best seller list. Being a blogger myself I am also reasonably sure that there are some things on there that I will like. 

On a not so related note, I am enjoying the latest bit of local wine from my latest visit to Italy. Very nice and only available locally. It shows you how clearly different wine can be.
