Need a color picker for OS X that also gives you HEX values? First get [HEXColorPicker](http://www.luckysoftware.dk/hexcolorpicker.php) to extend the default color picker to give out hex values. Then go [here](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060408050920158&amp;lsrc=osxh) for a little script that allows you to open the color picker from anywhere as if it were its own application. Problem solved. ;)
