Amazing concert, and amazingly loud. My ears are still ringing with my right one feeling a little weird. The place was a bit empty though with double the amount of people potentially having fit. That was probably part of the reason that the concert started a little slow. LC came on the stage in full force but the crowd was likely packed with musicians who wanted to see what the 4 guys will do in their respective fields. There was really very little movement in the crowd at that time.

But you just can't keep yourself from starting to get into it. I have to say that Living Colour Live is a few notches better than on the Album. They are performing the music, they are one sound level up, playing with the song, not simply playing the song. This wasn't so evident when I saw them last time some 8 years ago (?). I particularly liked the new songs but they had some mixes of old ones that were truely great. Core Glover amazed me this time with his voice, with Back in Black rocking the crowed. Vernon Reid most of the time looks really unemotional I have to say, which has a special charm to it though. He has his outburst but otherwise he just seems to be his guitare and himself alone, some people in front of him by pure chance. Doug Wimbish is simply amazing, a true artists and it was interesting seeing him get weird sounds out of everything including the air drums or whatever those were. Having playing drums myself, I will simply kneel in front of the mighty William Calhoun ;) The power of the band is amazing. Go see them if you are into loud, hard music with a high noise factor. I can only repeat what I said when the album came out, this is not only music, but sound, ment in a positive way.

For the tech adicts, it might be interesting that both doug and vernon had apple laptops which especially doug was using frequently. Oh, and [the official Living Colour web site](http://livingcolour.com/) is now open. Enjoy.
