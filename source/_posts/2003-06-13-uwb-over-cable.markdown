Yes, this one is in the wireless category, even though it is about cable. The thing is that UWB, or Ultra Wide Band, is mostly being considered as a replacement of bluetooth with very high bandwidth. It is only for short distances now because the power they can use, based on the FCC regulation, is very limited. It seems that a company called Pulse-Link has pattented UWB for cable to death as nobody was considering it, went arround the FCC that way and might have the potential to give cable companies the option to connect every home easily and with bandwith not in the 10s but in the hundreds of mbit/s, even up to 1.2gbit/s downstream. Now that's bandwidth!!! Check the current [Cringly Column](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20030612.html) for more. Great stuff. I agree with him that 2005 would be the next time to look at this and boy this might be big!
