That's that then. LikeWhoa, our current or rather last co-location facility has just been shut down. Really shut down. Dead. Servers inside. Damn! This is really annoying. We have moved quickly and have now put up e-mail on this server and moved default pages to another to tell people what is going on. Thankfully our domains are all set to a very low ttl (time to live) so that the domains are refreshed often. That meant that we could quickly change DNS entries and route mail to new locations.

The problem now is that we need to get the servers out of a verio co-location facility in new york (no verio is not bankrupt, our provider is who was hosting inside verio) and move them to a new one (likely isprime.com). As we are in Germany, we are not in New York, we can't move them. Hence, the isprime people are trying to get the servers out of there. As there are likely several people's servers in there, we presume that this will work swiftly, especially as many are moving to isprime.com.

I am currently very happy to have this domain here registered and hosted in germany at another provider. While this was ment to be a play thing, it is now becoming really useful :)
