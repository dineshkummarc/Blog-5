[Joi](http://joi.ito.com/) [posted](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/02/11/technorati_talk.html) some interesting Technorati links from eTech. Want to know what kind of [products people talk about](http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/products.html) or [who blogged about it](http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&amp;type=&amp;url=www.technorati.com%2Fcosmos%2Fproducts.html&amp;sub=Go%21)? You can also find out who has most [blogpower](http://www.technorati.com/blogpower.html). And I would gladly be enlightened please what [Plastic](http://www.plastic.com/) is all about??!?!?! I have the slight feeling it's a news site similar to the german [ShortNews](http://www.shortnews.de/), meaning that they simply link to articles anywhere and that anyone can post, which is a good concept. But still... why is everyone linking there?
