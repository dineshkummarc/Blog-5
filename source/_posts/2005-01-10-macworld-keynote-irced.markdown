If you want to follow the MacWorld keynote live, then [head over here](http://leoville.com/blog/index.php/TLR/comments/1298/) so get all the info on the people from [MacMerc](http://www.macmerc.com/) talking about the conference live, including Leo Laporte from his Sidekick II, logging in to his server, chatting via [BitchX](http://www.bitchx.org/) :) Looking forward to it.
