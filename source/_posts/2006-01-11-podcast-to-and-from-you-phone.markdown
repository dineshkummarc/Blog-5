Florian  to [Phonecaster.de](http://phonecaster.de/index.html), a german service that does some nice things. First, they have made available some phone numbers that you can ring, with your BASE mobile phone flatrate for example, to hear a podcast. Braincast- auf der Frequenz des Gehirns, is available at 0931 663927 345 for example.

The other nice thing is that you can [record your own podcasts from your phone](http://phonecaster.de/record.html). Simple call 0931 663927 999 and you get an accountnumber and a pin and they publish what you say as a special RSS Feed. Nice stuff.

**Update**: I have a [useless podcast](feed://feeds.feedburner.com/owtPodCast) :) (And no, I just say that I don't have a clue what to say, but this might be usably in the future :)
