As I just found out [via Loic](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2005/01/cnn_has_rss_fee.html), CNN now has RSS Feeds. Some more info including some feed urls are [here](http://www.paulbeard.org/wordpress/index.php?p=2430). The nice ones are really the &quot;most popular&quot; feeds, because they only give you those articles that based on internal log analysis have been read most. Very nice indeed. Because I surely don't want everything CNN posts :) And it seems that there is more to come. Wonderful. Now if they would only put a little bit more content in the feeds that would be nice.
