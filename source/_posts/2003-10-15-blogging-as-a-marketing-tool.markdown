Here is a good introduction to thinking about [Blogging as a Marketing tool](http://www.marketingprofs.com/print.asp?source=%2F3%2Fpayne2%2Easp). In general the idea is intriguing, but one thing has to be stressed though. If you want to be honest, be honest. That's a lot harder than you think. You need to free your employee to write and write what they want. There might be some areas he better not touch but he should be able to write about it. If that person can't then the honesty will be all but vaporized.
