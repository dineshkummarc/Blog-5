Again one of the posts that I don't know where to put. It's about a business venture in web development and will effect my life in general :) I am talking about [Oddpost](http://www.oddpost.com/), a web based e-mail application that is truely stunning. For now I didn't like web based e-mail because of the lack of features and lack of integration but Oddpost seems to go in the right direction. Add to that that they have an integrated RSS Reader (which is actually how I found them), I am starting to be sold. $30 per year is actually OK and with their system of donating 10% of that to charity I am actually feeling good about it (stupid me :)). 

What I like about the company is that they seem to be open, true, honest, ... call it what you want. The best idea would probably be that they achieved what the cluetrain manifesto talked about (right or wrong it might be), being that the company is talking with a human voice. You can even see how [Ethan and Iain started the company](http://www.oddpost.com/photoOdyssey.html) spiced up with a few pictures of animals. 

Now if they integrate SyncML to let me Sync my Mobile Phone with the contacts Database and allow WAP or IMAP access to their System so I can check my mail on the go via their servers, then I am starting to really like it. First though, I need to continue some playing with the system. 

Update: They provide IMAP access ... where's SyncML then? ;)
