Bill Mann from TMF has written a very nice article entitled &lt;I&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;What Does Fannie Mae Do?&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fool.com/news/commentary/2004/commentary04100602.htm&quot;&gt;What Does Fannie Mae Do?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/I&gt;, trying to explain to everyone what Fannie Mae really does and why they currently have problems. Very good read in relation to really knowing what a company does and knowing its management.
