That actually says it all. The bigger they get, the more pain they are. This counts for the company currently responsible for my internet connection which says that they have load problems ... ok ... BUT SINCE THURSDAY?!?!? They are also sending the bills to the wrong people, which is just as stupid.

Then there is a hosting company which is being an enormous pain to cancel an account with them and get the domain moved away from them. Of course reaching them to sign up is no problem but you have this very special non-free number where you hang in line for 30 minutes before somebody tells you that the person responsible for that is not there. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

I need to de-register a company in the US which has been an ongoing effort for some time and you would have thought that if you tell the people: &quot;Send me everything I need and bill everything to this Visa card&quot; that things would not take over a month. Well nothing yet. Another phone call.

Well back to business. Grr...
