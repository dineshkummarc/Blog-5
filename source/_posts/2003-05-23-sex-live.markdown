Phones are getting more and more advanced these days. Some even have polyphonic ring tones that sound just like real life and some even have voice control, which means that the user can make up key-words that will do something, like picking up the phone. Some of the phones have both.

This is what proved to be interesting in a case [cited on infoSync](http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/3613.html). Somebody at a wonderful night out with his girlfriend had his SonyEricsson P800 with him... with a ring tone that, interestingly enough, had the word &quot;answer&quot; in it... which was his magic key-word to pick up the phone ... ... ... You guessed it, somebody called. :)
