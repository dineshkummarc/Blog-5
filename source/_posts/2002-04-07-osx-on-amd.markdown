Seems that there are rumors out there that OSX might come to AMD Clawhammer CPUs.

What I presume though is that Apple would require AMD to make a little tweak in their CPU so that it only runs on the CPUs given to Apple. Now I don't know if that is possible but it would sound like an interesting move.
