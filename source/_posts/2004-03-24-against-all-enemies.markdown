Damn! I just looked at [Technorati's BookTalk](http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/products.html) and actually wanted to get [Richard Clarke's Against all Enemies](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743260244), which appeared on Monday and well... the 300.000 copies were sold out in 2 days and now it is not available on Amazon.de and stupidly enough I can't even put it on my wishlist. Bad Amazon, Bad Amazon! Now I need to post about it to remember ;)
