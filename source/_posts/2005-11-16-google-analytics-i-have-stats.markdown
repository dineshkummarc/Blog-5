Woohooo... I have my stats! The ones that everyone is waiting for. I have mine. [Now](http://www.google.com/analytics). And it's clearly geared towards a site which wants to track conversion, but for that it rocks big time. So for all those that just want stats on their blog, stick with [StatCounter](http://statcounter.com) for now. If you are looking to going deeper and really want to understand your traffic and possibly make some money with your site, check these things out as examples of what the system is capable of:

You can for example look at your referring sources, and then see what the Lifetime Value from that source to-date is:
&lt;img width=&quot;436&quot; vspace=&quot;4&quot; hspace=&quot;4&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; alt=&quot;$ per Visit&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.thylmann.net/Picture%202.png&quot; /&gt;

Or you can check the location where users come from and then see what your average $ amount per Visit is for that location.
&lt;img width=&quot;219&quot; vspace=&quot;4&quot; hspace=&quot;4&quot; height=&quot;93&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; alt=&quot;Lifetime Value&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.thylmann.net/Picture%201-1.png&quot; /&gt;

I still have to dig down deeper into the stats and push it on to some sites that really need to know about conversions, but for now, it looks like a very nice tool. If you are looking for your real referrers, check the Marketing Optimization -&gt; Marketing Campaign Results -&gt; Referrer Conversion. There is lots to find out if you just wonder around a bit.
