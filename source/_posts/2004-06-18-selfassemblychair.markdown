Check out &lt;a title=&quot;Chair Fix&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/chair-fix-016413.php&quot;&gt;Chair Fix&lt;/a&gt; on Gizmodo. Nice. You could open up a restaurant anywhere in like 5 minutes. You come with a truck, put up a grill and everyone gets their chair at the entrance ;)
