I have seen the light. Sounds a bit corny but that's what I think about [EQO](http://www.eqo.com/). The application links in to your Skype installation on your PC and gives you a view of that PC application. That means that I can send instant messages to the users that are online but even better than that I can call them, and not via my [Base Internet Flatrate](http://www.base.de/) and VoIP but via my PC. Huh? Yeah, the PC will call both my phone and the person I want to call. Hence I can call people in other countries a lot cheaper than using my phone directly as long as I have a good balance on my SkypeOut account. Congratulations guys (and girls)! Great app, great idea, great design, great execution. Now all I need is a linux client to get a second skype account to always be online on a server to not have to leave my PC running.
