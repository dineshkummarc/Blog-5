Joi recently [posted about](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/10/20/mapping_the_space.html) what he calles &quot;[his space](http://joi.ito.com/images2/space.jpg)&quot;. It's actually a very nice diagram to begin thinking a bit along the lines of what will change this world we are living in. What will be the drivers of changes coming tomorrow. I still have to think a bit if I agree with him or not though and I might be partitioning the space a little bit differently, but that needs some free processing time in my brain which is currently occupied. :)
