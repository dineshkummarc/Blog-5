Now that is interesting news: [BOSS - The Next Step in our Open Search Ecosystem](http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000599.html). Techcrunch as a [positive note](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/09/yahoo-radically-opens-web-search-with-boss/) and RWW thinks it's [exciting news](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/yahoo_opens_its_search_engine.php) and I have to agree. Of course as both also note there are limitations to all of this but it is a good first step.

In short, you will have full API access without rate limits to query the Yahoo! Search Backend, getting back results based on your query as for example JSON, being able to do with it whatever you like. In our case at Ormigo we might want to do searches for related pages within Ormigo, enhancing the results based on internal data we have and adding a few external links based on where they came in in the results.

Check out [Me.dium](http://me.dium.com/) for example to see one company already using the system. Actually a very nice idea to use my and my friends surfing behaviour to give me the right results. Sadly I don't see all my friends installing the browser bar so it is out for me.

In any case this will drive innovation in the space and I am looking forward to see what comes out of it. In the long run you will be able to pay CPM based or you will have to run their ads next to the search results, which makes it a little bit less altruistic, but that's ok. For now, all is fair game, so go play.
