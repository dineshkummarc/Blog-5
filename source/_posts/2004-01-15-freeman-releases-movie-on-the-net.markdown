It seems that Morgan Freeman will release his new movie on the net at the same time as it starts in the theatres. A long article about this can be found [here](http://news.com.com/2100-1025_3-5137972.html?) on News.com. (Thanks to Fred's log for [the pointer](http://www.com-soft.de/mt/archives/000027.html)). This is also interesting in relation to the problem that there seem to be copies of almost every screener sent to the Acadamy for review out there to be had on file sharing applications. At least based on [this post](http://www.waxy.org/archive/2004/01/14/research.shtml) on Waxy.org. Making them available on the internet, with payment obviously, will increase or diminish that problem. I am not yet sure which way it will go.
