unddu.de is only. It's a german social network that seems to have a bit of everything, like myspace, blogs, videos, ... . And it's done by United Internet, who own among others web.de and gmx. You can sign up now... not everyone though.

For those of you not fluent in German, the above reads: To become a member of unddu.de you need a GMX or web.de eMail address.

Ok, that's that for me. What I do find interesting is that unddu.de was supposed to be everything for everybody. They said that all these niche things lead to too many accounts on different platforms and you need one central things. Everything seems to be true. Everyone seems to be limited to United Internet customers. Come one people, open it up, or make it invitation only. But don't limit it to those people that have these emails. Looking forward to seeing it open up tomorrow after a blogger backlash ;)
