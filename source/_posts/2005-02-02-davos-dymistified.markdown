First posted, then pulled and now reposted, is the three part story by Rony Abovitz, CTO of [z-kat](http://www.z-kat.com/). I had read the original posting, loved it and am happy that it is back. It's a satirical piece that somehow seems to get across the wild emotional ride that unprepared visitors will have to live with. Here are some excerpts and the links.

[Through the looking glass Pt. 1](http://www.forumblog.org/blog/2005/02/through_the_loo.html): *[...] I find myself in a heated discussion on human consciousness, babbling on about living robots and mysticism and all sorts of California kinds of things. Robotic frogs. Of course! Yes, it is a dream because Sharon Stone is sitting behind me, talking to her agent and nodding when the Buddhist Monk talks about reaching the ninth level of understanding in the 500th lifetime. Getting pretty wierd now. I am in an argument with some British Dutchess who is also a professor at Oxford or some such thing and who speaks ten times faster than a normal person. She speaks so fast that I almost expect her head to spin a 360. Is that the Prime Minister of India? Pakistan? The CEO of Infosys? A soft pillow is a clear conscience. [...]*

Then on he goes in [Through the Looking Glass Pt. II](http://www.forumblog.org/blog/2005/02/through_the_loo_1.html): *[...] Muppet velociraptors, hunting in pairs, killing you with their utter Googleness. They really are Google. They just ooze utter Googleness. It's a shiny, happy place in GoogleLand, and all of the rules have changed. They gave me that hey dude, we know you hacked your way in too, but we found the cheat code book. We are so far ahead its sick. And we're holding back like, so much. We're the new dungeonmasters, the new sysops. This is like the ultimate video game and they won and now they own the arcade. They have infinite bonus lives, unlimited ammo, and they found the source code and are now building mods as they go. Wozniak, Jobs, Captain Crunch - hackers of the world - the Google guys have smoked you beyond belief. They have hacked in and taken over the kernel, and boy are they having fun. Much respect to the GoogleGuys. [...]*

He finishes off with [Through the Looking Glass Pt. III](http://www.forumblog.org/blog/2005/02/through_the_loo_2.html). Here you go for a teaser: *[...] want to go home. I want to go home. And where are you going? My name is Dorothy the girl said, and I am going to the Emerald City, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas. Can I come too? [...]*

Thanks a lot Rony for the posting. Loved it.
