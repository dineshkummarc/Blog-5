Now if that isn't interesting. I just found out [via Oliver Wagner](http://www.agenturblog.de/archives/2005/02/43_things_ist_e.php) that the following Salon.com article gives out a little secret: [ title=&quot;Salon.com Technology | Amazon's 43 secrets&quot;&gt;Salon.com Technology | Amazon's 43 secrets](http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2005/02/08/43/).

The thing is that it seems like [43 Things](http://www.43things.com/) is made up of many ex-Amazon employees and Amazon might be their online investor. I am going careful here because it's all still a little sketchy but if this is truely the case, and if there is some kind of deal with Amazon that they get some special access to the data, then this might become scary. Then again, everyone has access to the data on the site anyway and if they build up some kind of web services interface that might get really interesting. They actually [posted about the investment](http://robotcoop.com/weblog/52/on-background) on the 8th. Congratulations guys, have lots of fun, and hope to [see you in 2 years](http://www.43things.com/things/view/9) :)
