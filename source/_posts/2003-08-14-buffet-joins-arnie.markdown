Well now this kicks. Our beloved [Arnie](http://www.joinarnold.com/) is running for Governor in California and this in itself is interesting indeed. I like the idea that Arnie said that he would pay for his campaign in his own way, with his own fortune of some 40 million USD. Then again, he is already asking for contributions on his web site it seems. 

The most interesting fact comes now though. It seems that Arnie has appointed no other than Warren Buffet of [Bershire Hathaway](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/) as his counsel in economics. Now how cool is that. Arnie is republican and Buffet democrat but it seems that Buffet knows Arnie for some time and believes in his ability to lead California out of troubles. Looking forward to seeing the team that Buffet puts together.
