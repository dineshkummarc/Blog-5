That's what Cringly argues for in his latest post entitled  [Going for Broke](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20050609.html). Good thoughts as always. I wondered why Apple didn't announce they were going to the Cell processor and why they moved against the XBox (a friend argues MS chose that partly because games will be harder to crack) and  PS3. Looking forward to seeing this unfold.
