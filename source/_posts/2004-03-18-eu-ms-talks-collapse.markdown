There we go. I just [read on Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/articles/04/03/18/1343206.shtml?tid=109&amp;tid=123&amp;tid=187&amp;tid=99) that the talks between the EU and Microsoft have collapsed. A good summary can be found [here](http://www.techworld.com/news/index.cfm?fuseaction=displaynews&amp;NewsID=1229) and Monti's direct comments are [here](http://europa.eu.int/rapid/start/cgi/guestfr.ksh?p_action.gettxt=gt&amp;doc=IP/04/365%7C0%7CRAPID&amp;lg=EN&amp;display=). So what does that mean? MS will probably have to pay somewhere between $100 million and $1 billion. They will also have to open up Windows to some extent and offer a Version of windows without Media Player. A well, the power of Mr. Monti :)
