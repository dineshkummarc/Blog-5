I just found the &lt;a title=&quot;Current Electoral Vote Predictor 2004&quot; href=&quot;http://www.electoral-vote.com/&quot;&gt;Current Electoral Vote Predictor 2004&lt;/a&gt;, which is a web site telling you how the elections are likely to turn out. The site is a personal project by Andrew Tanenbaum, U.S citizen living in Holland, teaching at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, being an active Democrat Abroad, the writer of MINIX and author of five books. It's not funded by anyone just his own money is now as of alexa.com the [top 3090 web property on the net](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=http://www.electoral-vote.com/)!

Great stuff to look at as the elections take place. The site even has a [RSS Feed](http://www.electoral-vote5.com/info/rss-info.html)! :)

&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: I put my money where my mouth is (thinking that electoral-vote.com kicks ;)) and put a few EURs on Kerry on [Bluevex's Presidential Election Bet](http://www.bluevex.de/sportbets2/website/viewEventSnapshot.do;node5?id=2901871). Let's see if I make some money :)
