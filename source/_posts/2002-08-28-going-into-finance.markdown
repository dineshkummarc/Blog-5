Seems like I will be working at Onvista (http://www.onvista-ag.de) for 6 months (not sure for how long yet) in Business Development for the Portal part (http://www.onvista.de), which is the biggest bank independant portal for financial information in Germany. I just got the confirmation call. The fun thing is that it's a startup (traded on the german neuer markt since february 2000) but with the, seemingly, right mix of old economy / new economy management. Lots of freedom for employees but with clear goals. Starting on the 9th of September and really looking forward to it. Ha!
