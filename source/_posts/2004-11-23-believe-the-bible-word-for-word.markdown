Ok, this is scary. A Gallup Poll had some interesting results. I quote from their page: 

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.gallup.com/poll/content/login.aspx?ci=14107&quot;&gt;Only about a third of Americans believe that Charles Darwin's theory of evolution is a scientific theory that has been well supported by the evidence, [...] Forty-five percent of Americans also believe that God created human beings pretty much in their present form about 10,000 years ago. A third of Americans are biblical literalists who believe that the Bible is the actual word of God and is to be taken literally, word for word.

Ok people. This is a tiny bit scary here. I have no problem with religion whatsoever. But 45% of Americans believe God created Human beings 10.000 years ago? Okok, I might have to see the real questions to fully judge if this is really the case, but all in all, this is ... I have no word. Let me repeat that I have no problem with living by the Bible, which is wonderful, but scientific evidence highly suggests that this evolution thing is true. Then again, maybe all this was wrong and [34000 years ago Tom gave birth to all this](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2002/04/the_stargate_co.html) :)
