Some of you might have seen that in some Google AdSense Ads, there is now &quot;Gooooooogle&quot; instead of &quot;Google&quot;. ResearchBuzz took the time to look up that domain ... [see for yourself](http://www.researchbuzz.org/archives/001971.shtml). An interesting marketing strategy by some deranged marketing guy, or girl.

On a related note, Google's Index seems to be full. Check out [Nico's post on it](http://nico.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=600). :)
