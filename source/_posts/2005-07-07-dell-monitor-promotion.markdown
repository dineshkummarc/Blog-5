Dell in Germany currently has an interesting promotion. As some might know, the 20&quot; widescreen that Dell sells is the exact same thing (just black) as the Apple 20&quot; widescreen. But the Dell one costs â‚¬599 or actually, â‚¬450 if you buy two. :) That's the promotion they have at the moment, buy two of them and get the second one 50% off. Hmmm... Are they doing that because the model is running out? Or is it just a good deal? Anyone want a monitor? Preferably living in Cologne? :)

**Update**: Damn, that's without VAT. Grrr... makes it just this tad more expensive that doesn't feel quite right.
