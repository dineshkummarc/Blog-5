That was, or is, the headline of the TMF story about the death of the portfolios. Yes, it's over. The real money portfolios, that were often the center of attention and much discussed, will soon be no more. They were used a teaching guideline and often (mis-)used as a sample portfolio by some people who thought that the included companies were the ones to own. This was not the initial idea though. Bill Mann [argues though](http://www.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2003/rulemaker030219.htm) that &quot;*Where perception conflicts with reality, sometimes reality must budge first.*&quot; This is the case here. Many people thought that the portfolios should be mirrored, while they should not be and no matter how often you say that, people will still do this. Sad to see them go, but it will likely improve the editorial content on TMF.
