[This](http://www.domainratte.de.ki/) is a very nice tool to find out stuff about a web site. It looks for the whois status, searchengine hits, search engine advertising, linkpopularity, search request, wayback machine, brands registered and wheter the domain is for sale.

Seems to be a tool for people buying domains for traffic :)
