If you have Python, it is very likely that you can use [GmailFS - The Gmail Filesystem](http://richard.jones.name/google-hacks/gmail-filesystem/gmail-filesystem.html) :) What this guy did is what [Jeremy suggested](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/002116.html), namely making all your wonderful eMail space into file storage. I haven't tried it yet but I still have some GMail invites and if nobody wants them I might treat myself for some more free storage ;)
