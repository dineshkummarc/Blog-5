In true blogging fashion, [Dan Gillmor](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/) has started [a blog](http://wethemedia.oreilly.com/) to his new book [We The Media](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/wemedia/). Being a true blogger, he set it up to ping different web service for new posts. In a show of true blogging power [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/) picked it up and through a setting in Joi's Technorati profile, joi got an alert about the blog. In true blogging fashion, [Joi posted about it](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/07/21/we_the_media_blog.html) :) Now the blog is no longer hidden from view, but public, even though it is still in beta. I have to give it to Technorati though. The site alerted me of co-workers starting their blog in the matter of a few hours.
