Russel's post on [ title=&quot;Russell Beattie Notebook - VoIP and VoiceXML&quot;&gt;VoIP and VoiceXML](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008176.html) pointed me once again to [TellMe](http://www.tellme.com/), a company I had looked at when they founded and thought to be amazingly cool. I remember them having fotos of their new offices online which was fun to look at. They were this bunch of people with a vision, most of them coming from AOL/Netscape which was a big story back then anyway. I did wonder why they thought they could be so huge and I did feel said when they had to scale back and kind of got lost under the radar. 

Now Russel sends me back there and I am amazed. They have been an enormous success I will have to say. Checking out their clients list and milestones is a joy to see and there is still lots of potential. It's just differently worded. They did want to create the voice internet. Giving you access to everything online kind of. Now they really seem to be working more along the line of automating things you call. This once again shows that you need the drive and commitment to follow through, but to also potentially change your business model or your view of the world along the way. Congratulations guys.
