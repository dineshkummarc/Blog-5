I just stumbled on the new kind of mobility. For all the surfers, snowboards, longboarders out there, this seems to be the ultimate riding experience. Check out some [first hand experience](http://www.insomedia.com/bmwstreetcarver/) or go directly to [StreetCarver.com](http://www.streetcarver.com/). Sadly it costs 500 EURs. The dream machine is built and designed by BMW!
