You want power? You get power. I posted some time ago about [Google's Shipping Container Data Center](http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/11/18/googles-shipping-container/), an idea to put an entire data center into a shipping container. That seems to have been done, as of today. Check out Sun's [Project Blackbox](http://www.sun.com/emrkt/blackbox/index.jsp). It's a shipping container that you can, sometime maybe, buy from Sun, including 250 Fire T1000 Servers.

You configure it, get it shipped and dropped of somewhere, then just add power and internet and you are done. Sadly, it's a prototype. So it might just be a marketing stunt by some photoshop artists inside Sun.
