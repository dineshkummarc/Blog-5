Nokia was kind enough to give me a Nokia N810 some time ago and it is a really nice tool. Recently a new release came out, called [Diablo](http://maemo.org/news/announcements/view/os2008_feature_upgrade-reflash_your_tablet-for_the_last_time.html) and I suggest you update to that first. There is a slight problem with the Flasher for OS X in that you will have to not start flashing until your table boots with the USB sign in the top right. You get that by keeping the top button on the left side of your screen pressed and then turning it on.

Next up [go to Talk Android](http://www.talkandroid.com/134-android-nokia-n810-install/) to get all the stuff you need. For those who know how to use gainroot to get root access on the device, I suggest editing their /usr/bin/android.sh with the information in [this post](http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showpost.php?p=198852&amp;postcount=6), adding the stuff just below the 'echo &quot;starting Android ...&quot;' bit. Also, if you want Internet Access from within Android then you will need to log in to a nocat hotspot from within Diablo first. If you install further apps just put them in /android/system/app on the MMC card you installed android on.

Have fun running Android :)
