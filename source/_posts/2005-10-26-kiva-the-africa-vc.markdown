Ok, so you are not getting a return on invest in monetary terms but you do potentially get a very good feeling.&lt;a title=&quot;
Kiva&quot; href=&quot;http://www.kiva.org/index.php&quot;&gt;
Kiva allows you to give money, something between $300 and $500 to entrepreneurs in Africa, who will repay you that money from the profits they make in their new business. The foundation behind it is payed for by other means, so your $300 seem to go to the guy or girl on the street. Interesting concept.
