I have just been snowboarding for the second time in my life. The last time was some 14 years ago if I am not mistaken but this time was the first time that I could translate what was told to me back then. You might wonder where I have been snowboarding. Well, at the [Alpincenter](http://www.alpincenter.com/) in Bottrop. It's an indoor ski thingie and for beginners it's a lot of fun. I was there with 7 friends and many of us tried out new things. If you can really ski, then the track is probably not too much fun, still enjoyable but just not chalenging. But if you are just starting or are trying to freshen up your old knowledge, go for it. At the end of the evening it actually went pretty well. My main problem became especially clear at one time though. I can turn right a lot better than left (my left foot is downhill) and then somebody was skying to my right ... and he was exactly my speed ... he didn't go any faster, or slower than me ... I was getting faster ... so was he ... and I didn't know what to do ... in the end I could brake but it was becoming too fast for me perference. I also was persuaded to try a small jump once and the jump was good, but afterwards I was again fairly fast and then you are just thinking &quot;Don't get the wrong curve into the snow ... Don't get the wrong curve into the snow ...&quot; ;)
