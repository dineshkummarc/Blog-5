This here is a pretty critical german piece about the new hardliners in the Bush administration, led by Paul D. Wolfowitz: &lt;a title=&quot;n-tv.de - Der Krieg aus der Denkfabrik&quot; href=&quot;http://www.n-tv.de/3147543.html&quot;&gt;n-tv.de - Der Krieg aus der Denkfabrik (try babelfish.altavista.com for a translation maybe). It's very good to get this perspective I think, but it should be remembered that it is an opinion piece.

To get another view on the entire story, I suggest you take a look [here](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/iraq/view/). This is a PBS Frontline special &quot;The War behind closed doors&quot;. It's a 6 piece video report on how the two camps within the Bush administration are fighting in relation to what the good thing to do is. And I truely believe that what Wolfowitz has thought up is something that he believes is the good thing to do. Whether anyone agrees or not is a totally different thing.
