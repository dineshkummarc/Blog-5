Some time ago [Sun](http://www.sun.com/) added a [blogging policy](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/02/Policy) for all employees and started a [hosted blogging service for all of them](http://blogs.sun.com/). This in itself is very cool and probably at least partly due to [Tim Bray](http://tbray.org/ongoing/) working there now. Top top it off, now [Jonathan Schwartz](http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/ceo/mgt_schwartz.html), their COO, is started [his blog](http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan). To be watched.
