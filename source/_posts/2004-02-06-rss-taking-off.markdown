I've been saying again and again that RSS, or syndication formts like it (e.g. Atom), have a great future ahead of them. I was reminded of that fact when I read [this post](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001550.html) by Jeremy Zawodny, where he explains that he is currently quizzed about RSS very frequently at work. With his work being Yahoo!, this has a bit of weight.
