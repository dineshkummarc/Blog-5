Tim Bray has a great post entitled &lt;a title=&quot;Itâ€™s Not Dangerous&quot; href=&quot;http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/03/08/BloggingIsGood&quot;&gt;*Itâ€™s Not Dangerous*, going on about why blogging is really good for your and your carreer, even though everybody seems to be writing a different story. Great points and I'd add general knowledge management. It's a great thing to get your thoughts out of your head on paper, see them in writing, see the comments, rethink, internalize, socialize, ... good stuff. No go blog!
