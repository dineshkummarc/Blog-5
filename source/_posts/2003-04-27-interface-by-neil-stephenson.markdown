Based on the other books by Neil Stephenson, especially Cryptonomicon, I was looking forward to this one. It's writting together with Frederick George and I couldn't put it down until I was finished, reading it the entire trip back in the plane from the US, which made the trip back seem a lot shorter than it was.

To keep this short, the book is very good. Without giving anything away, it's about somebody wanting to be president of the united states, a lot of money, interaction of chips and brains, understanding human emotions, demographics and great characters. As always, the characters are layed out in great detail, which allows the reader to feel part of the story to some extent.

If you like Neil's other books, you will like this one, even though it might be called a bit simpler than his previous ones. I actually like that though because I feel that Snow Crash was a bit too complicated. Sure, it was an amazing book, but I felt that Neil Stephenson was trying to prove his writing skills with that book, moving to just writing a great book in Cryptonomicon. With Interface he has simply written a great book, with the help of Frederick George, or vice versa, whoever was taking the lead in the writing of the book.
