Aldi, the low cost super market in germany, is now going mobile. They will be selling the [Sendo M550](http://www.sendo.com/ourphones/details.asp?ID=9) under their own Tevion brand for 150 EURs without contract. This is a great deal for Sendo I presume because Aldi sells huge volumes. I'll really have to look at this.
