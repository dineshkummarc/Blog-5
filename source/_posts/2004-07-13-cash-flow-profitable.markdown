Jerr Nolan wrote in yesterday's [Main dish](http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2004/07/main_dish_3.html) about the [Yahoo! Oddpost acquisition](http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/07/oddpost_acquire.html). It included an interesting term: 

&lt;I&gt;This is a great story about a couple of entrepreneurs who bootstrapped the company when VC's couldn't get past the fact that the company is a paid email service. Cash flow profitable and growing, Oddpost proved that you could build something from nothing... and sell it for $30 million.&lt;/I&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Cash flow profitable&lt;/b&gt;. Wonderful. Normally this should mean cash flow positive if I remember correctly, but profitable shifts it arround in just the right way. For a young company, cash is what counts, and being cash flow profitable is just plain wonderful then. I like the term. Very VCish ;)
