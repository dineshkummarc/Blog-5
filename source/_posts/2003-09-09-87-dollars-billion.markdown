Just read this on [Birdhouse](http://birdhouse.org/blog/archives/001049.php):

*How much is $87 billion? For that amount of money, America could: 
Solve the school budget crisis in every one of our communities,
OR
Provide health insurance for every uninsured American child for 15 years,
OR
Provide food for all 6 million of the children who die from hunger around the world for 7 years.*
