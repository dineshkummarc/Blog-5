I said it in 2002 in [an infoSync article](http://blog.thylmann.net/2002/11/blogging_goes_w.html) and it is starting to become very true. The press is no longer the first on the scene. With everyone having a mobile phone and most of those being video capable, the people on the scene will be people seeing it live as it happens and being able to shoot pictures and videos right then and there. Check out [this BBC News Video](http://www.smartmobs.com/archive/2006/01/11/bbc_how_mobile.html) to see what the BBC thinks about the trend of citizen journalism.
