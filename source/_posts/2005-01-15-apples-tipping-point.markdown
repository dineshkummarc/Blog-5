Paul Nixon has built an amazing graphic at: &lt;a title=&quot;Apple's Tipping Point: Macs for the Masses&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nixlog.com/apple/&quot;&gt;Apple's Tipping Point: Macs for the Masses&lt;/a&gt;. It shows how Apple's product lines are slowly but surely converging to create a huge opportunity to build on each other. If you take into account that Tom Peters said that in the future we will compete on Design in his latest book Re-Imagine, I can only say that if this is true, then Apple is very well positioned to leverage their design expertise to give people the products they crave, not want, not need, crave. And with the Mac Mini and the iPod Shuffle anyone can now. ([source](http://apple.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000030027351/))
