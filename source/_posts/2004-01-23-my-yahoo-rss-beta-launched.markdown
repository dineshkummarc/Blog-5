This seems to be Jeremy week. Is it my fault that he has some interesting things to say? ;) Anyway, he just put some stuff online about the &lt;a title=&quot;My Yahoo! RSS Beta Launched&quot; href=&quot;http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001474.html&quot;&gt;My Yahoo! RSS Beta Launched and has some nice information about the features of the service. I wondered when Yahoo! would do that and now its there and it should finally prove to some of the executives out there that RSS is a force to really really take into account.
