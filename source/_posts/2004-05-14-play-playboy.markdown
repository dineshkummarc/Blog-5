Interesting game that is coming out. You can now play playboy ;)

*But this November, anyone with a PC, PlayStation 2 or Xbox will have the opportunity to put on Hef's smoking jacket and lord over his mansion. Game publishers Arush Entertainment and Groove Games will release Playboy: The Mansion, a video game that puts players in the virtual footwear of the publishing tycoon.

&quot;You can create your own Playboy magazine and throw your own parties,&quot; Hefner said.*
