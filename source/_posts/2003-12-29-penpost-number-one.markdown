There we have it. Actually, no, this is not a penpost only. What this is 
is the introduction to the idea. I just got the Nokia Digital Pen and the 
Nokia 6600 Mobile Phone is in the mail. The two together, with the help 
of MFOP2, allow me to post things written with the Pen, live, from anywhere 
where the phone works via eMail. I can write, draw, sketch, ... whatever 
works with a Pen on paper.

I'll see what comes out of it. So here is the first image so you can beware of 
what to expect ;)
