I saw this on TV yesterday and it rocks. The show is full of horn players, dancers, percussionists, singers, very wild and funny and upbeat. Now I found [the CD](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004WH76/bizkiffer-20/) and the DVD on Amazon. Sadly it's not available here it seems, I need to look around. There are some samples of it but I think I will need to get the DVD. I mailed amazon.de to see if I can get it here somehow. 

Sadly the samples do not have the amazing percussion scenes.
