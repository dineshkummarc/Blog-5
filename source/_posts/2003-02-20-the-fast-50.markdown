I haven't read it yet, but FastCompany's &lt;a title=&quot;Fast 50&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/fast50_02/&quot;&gt;Fast 50&lt;/a&gt; will likely hold a depth of knowledge that takes a bit of time to go over. Some might be wrong, some might be challenging, but it will surely be thought provocing. This is definitely on my reading list.
