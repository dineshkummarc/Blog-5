[Fast Company Now](http://blog.fastcompany.com/) has a very nice post as a summary from BlogOn talking about [business transparency](http://blog.fastcompany.com/archives/2004/07/23/business_transparency.html). It starts with the good side, in the sense that Microsoft is currently opening up and they are making huge progress with [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/). This site has over 700k visitors a month. It's huge. It has endless amounts of videos of Microsoft workers ([great example](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=114)), from within Campus, the Wiki of the IETeam is on there, lots of great stuff. But there is also a bad side, seen in the MovableType pricing wars as well as in [this thread of comments on the IE Team blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2004/07/22/191629.aspx#FeedBack) (thanks [Jeremy](http://ensight.org/)). As always there is an upside and a downside. It's your decision to make it work or leave it be. I'd always be for the big hairy audacious goal, so I'd try to make it work.
