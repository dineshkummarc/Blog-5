It seems that Anssi Vanjoki, one of the Nokia board members has a speeding ticket and is fined 116000 eur! He drove 75 Km/h when only 50 km/h were allowed.

In finland though, the fine you pay is in relation to your salary and as you might guess Mr Vanjoki made some nice bundle in 1999.

During an argument on TMF I read something that I would like to share because it shows you that the Finish system is a really good one.

&lt;I&gt;Well, perhaps it feels easier to understand if you consider it as a form of community service. It just makes more sense to have Mr Vanjoki serving his time working in the Nokia management instead of ordering him to help old people in a rest home (or something like that). That's what this fine after all is supposed to mean, a period of time at work (the duration is determined by the seriousness of the offence) without a pay. &lt;/I&gt;
