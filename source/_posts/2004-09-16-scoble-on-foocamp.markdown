Scoble has a [nice post about FooCamp](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/09/15.html#a8210) linking to lots of pictures as well as the [FooCampers List](http://wiki.oreillynet.com/foocamp04/index.cgi?FooCampers) on the event wiki. I love this quote from him:

*It's a real joy to watch someone who knows far more than you do explain what they are doing in language that makes you think you can keep up.*
