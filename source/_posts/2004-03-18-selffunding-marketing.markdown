Wouldn't you just dream of that? Spending money and getting more in return? [startup skill.com](http://www.startupskills.com/) is doing just that. It seems that Richard Stokes manages to advertise on Google's [AdWords](http://adwords.google.com/) system to gain an audience and then refinances that Audience via [AdSense](http://www.google.com/adsense). Very good indeed. You can read more about it on: &lt;a title=&quot;What does AdSense pay?&quot; href=&quot;http://www.startupskills.com/archives/000098.html&quot;&gt;What does AdSense pay?. And I would have to say that there is still some optimization potential if he really wants to.
