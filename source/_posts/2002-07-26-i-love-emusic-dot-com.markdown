I have to say that I am very happy with my emusic subscription. I would never have gotten some of the music I have now otherwise. 

Bill Laswell - Hashisheen: The End of Law 
A very psychedelic experience with authors reading from their books. Simply amazing. 
Generally, Bill Laswell is amazing

Ventures - Surfing
A compilation of lots of surf like songs, instrumental and great to listen to on the sidelines

Groove Collection - It's all in your mind
Great groove, simple as that. 

Peter Rybar, violin, and Marcelle Rybar, piano - The Rybar Due Play ... 
Classical stuff and them playing Bohuslaw Martinu: Sonate Nr. 3 is very enjoyable. 

Bass Factor - Bass Factor
Hard to explain, love it. Drum n bass, technoisch

Various Artists - Bomb Hip Hop - Revenge of the B-Boy
Very cool. &quot;Some people compose songs ... Dr. Rubberfunk de-compose. Now here to write some very nice songs, like this next one.&quot; 

Jeep Jazz Project - Digital Flavor on the Sonic Frontier
Jazz Funk Fusion, or something. Feel da groove ;)

Universal Being - Elephant Fusion
Now this is weird. Period. But good. 

Various Artists - Fearless Records - Punk goes Pop
Punk bands playing pop songs. &quot;Get this party Started!!!&quot; ;)

Bass Mekanik - Download
One of their picks and I love it. Unclassifiable reads my iTunes Genre

Great stuff all in all.
