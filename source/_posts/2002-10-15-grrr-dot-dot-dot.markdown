What we had here in Germany was the option to invest in stocks for more than a year. In this case you would not pay any taxes of the gains when you sold the stock. This is really a nice thing to get people to invest for the long term and not simply trade stocks. Well. Seems like the new/current coalition is taking this away. Well if that won't do the stock market some good.
