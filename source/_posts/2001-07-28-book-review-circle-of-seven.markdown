I just read Circle of Seven by Clay Jacobsen. To use the Amazon description:

&lt;I&gt;Challenged to create a sensational story for the sweeps ratings period, Investigative television reporter Mark Taylor embarks on what becomes the most dangerous adventure of his career. 
Taking a fresh look behind the scenes of the political process, Mark expects to to find a strong bias in the polling questions and how the results are reported. Instead He uncovers something else?more sinister and evil than he had ever expected. 

A clandestine group of media elite is manipulating the country to their own twisted ideals, and only Mark stands in their way. 

Suspense blends with romance when Mark meets and falls in love with Tracy Faircloth, granddaughter of the mysterious circle's leader. He must choose between his career or the truth, and all hangs in the balance as he seeks to bring down the Circle of Seven. &lt;/I&gt;

It's really very good. I read it through the night until 5:30 am, which kind of tells you how good it is :) The only thing I did not like is that it is written with a very Christian group bounding together so well for the sake of good things and helping everybody and I sometimes wondered if the author was writing a story or wanted me to become a Christian. :) But I have to say that it fits well into the book, so I would say it is ok.

If you are looking for a good book to read then take this for your holidays. It will get your mind of things and you will have some fun reading it. But depending how fast you read you will have to buy another book too :)
