The typical ramp up time for new employees is 3-6 months. With [FON](http://fon.com/) having hired loads of people the last few months, it seems that speed is finally kicking in. The next firmware is announced for end of june and it will support [two SSID's](http://blog.fon.com/en/archive/technology/two-ssids-just-what-you-asked-for.html), meaning that you will have a private network where you can also share the LAN (like my [network storage](http://blog.thylmann.net/2006/05/fon_router_soft.html)) while keeping it of the public network (something missing in 0.6.5). FON also released the [pricing idea](http://blog.fon.com/en/archive/business/bills-.html) for their system, meaning that if you are a Linus you will also be able to surf for free on Bill hotspots! Very cool indeed. And while we are at it, the [FON router](http://blog.fon.com/en/archive/gadgets/router-update.html) will come out in September and the Linksys you can buy over them is currently 19 EURs until first of June! It's a great box, buy one.
