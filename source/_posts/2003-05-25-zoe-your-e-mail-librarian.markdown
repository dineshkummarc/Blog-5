I just returned from a birthday party, which was rather nice with intense discussions, wonderful food and drinks ... all well. But why I am posting here, is that I have seen [Zoe](http://guests.evectors.it/zoe/itstories/story.php?data=stories&amp;num=16&amp;sec=1), a kind of librarian for your e-mail. As they say themselves, think of it as Google for E-Mail. They index everything and then give you easy access to your mail in several kind of ways. It was really looking nice and I suggest  those geeky among you should try it out. [here](http://guests.evectors.it/zoe/itstories/story.php?data=stories&amp;num=23&amp;sec=2) are some screenshots, in case you want to take a closer look.
