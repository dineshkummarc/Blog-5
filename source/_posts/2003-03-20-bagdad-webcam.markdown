We already have [somebody blogging](http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000631.php) in Irak and now we have a &lt;a title=&quot;Webcam in Iraq&quot; href=&quot;http://www.webcaminiraq.org/&quot;&gt;Webcam in Iraq too. I have to admit that I am not sure how often it is being updated and at this time it doesn't show anything of particular interest ... but it might ;)
