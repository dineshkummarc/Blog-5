Being a firm believer in WebServices, I was happy to read [these statistics](http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P5227_0_6_0_C) on Alwayson Network. 

Amazon API: 50000 Developers
eBay API: 8000 Developers
XML Api Requests served per month on eBay: 1 billion!!!

40% af all US listings come through XML for eBay. This is the power of WebServices!
