The last three of Joi's post have hit the cord of wireless and warrant mentioning. I'll start from the top with some finishing comments.

Sometimes you just read something fun, as this entry from [Joi](http://joi.ito.com/):

&lt;I&gt;When I was traveling in Europe this trip, I heard the default ringtone of the Nokia 6600 everywhere I went and it was confusing because I always thought it was my phone. I mentioned this to someone and they said, &quot;that's the sound of market share.&quot; ;-)&lt;/I&gt;

Then there is the  [South Korean Company that has sacked 161 employees via SMS](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/03/04/sacked_by_sms.html). 

The last one are some very good thoughts by Joi on Carriers going into the Content Business, argueing that with flatrates being available more and more, partly via WiFi, content is just not time sensitive enough to warrant for the large quantities to go over the Mobile Networks. I have to agree here to some extent. I think IM and stuff will be really important. Things where small volumes have a big impact. There might be some streaming but the focus is on time sensitiveness. We have bigger and bigger harddisks. Why do I need to download MP3s on the go when I can carry a 40gig iPod arround. 

The biggest chunks of Data will come from stuff like moblogging, photo albums in general, holiday videos. I think it's more about post than pull. You want to tell your friends stuff now, because you experienced it now, but I doubt that you need to experience it now just because your friend wants to tell it. The carriers focus should be absolutely on time critical issues. What do I _need_ to do _now_?
