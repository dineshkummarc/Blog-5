Why you ask? Well, I was already feeling old buying the washing machine some time back. It was a good investment. Then we bought a dish washer and I will have to admit that it changed my life. There is no single better technological achievement I can think of. Now the last in line was acquired this saturday. Welcome the proud owners of a laundry dryer. I love it and it doesn't do nocat, doesn't have an RSS feed and doesn't do any other technological tricks. It's just drying laundry. I feel good.

In related news, I am now cleaning my desk and after having finished the &quot;Creativity, Innovation and Change&quot; course from the [OUBS](http://oubs.open.ac.uk/) I am now getting ready for Knowledge Management, looking into using [JotSpot](http://www.jotspot.com/) a little more in the process.
