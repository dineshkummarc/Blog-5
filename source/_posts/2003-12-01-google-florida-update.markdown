[Here](http://www.searchengineguide.com/lloyd/2003/1125_bl1.html) is a very nice article on some changes to the Google index, which seem to apply mostly to commercial terms that are full of search-engine-optimized sites. In short, it seems like Google has a list of keywords that are over optimized and in that case add an algorithm over the standard ones that throw out sites that seem (!seem, not are) to be search engine optimized.
