The first thing you need is [FireFox](http://texturizer.net/firefox/download.html). This is a great browser on its own. Then, if you are doing something in web site development, you also need some [Extensions](http://texturizer.net/firefox/extensions/). For one you need the [WebDeveloper Extension](http://texturizer.net/firefox/extensions/#webdeveloper) which gives you a wonderful set of tools like:
- Viewing Form Fields and Information (including all hidden fields)
- Outline Images without Alt Attributes
- Show Alt Tags instead of Images
- View Cookie Information
- Outline Table Cells
- Resize to 800x600, 640x480, 1024x768
- Validate HTML, Links, CSS, ...

And this is just a short list. You also need the [EditCSS](http://texturizer.net/firefox/extensions/#editcss) extension. Go to any web site, click the button and you will get the sites CSS information on the left side and you can then hack arround in it and change that page live! Another nice thing is the [HTTP Live Headers Extension](http://texturizer.net/firefox/extensions/#livehttpheaders), which allows you to see which kind of info went back and forth in the header. 

All in all, this stuff makes FireFox even better than it already is.
