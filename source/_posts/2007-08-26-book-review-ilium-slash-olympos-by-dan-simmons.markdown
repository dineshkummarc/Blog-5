Once again, I have found another that I truly love. I started reading Ilium well over a year ago and stopped again because it was just confusing. I mean it starts with some small robot under water trying to get away from something huge, a group of people that seem to live in all too happy times and that can teleport (fax), and a little bit of Achilles, Troja, Zeus and other.

A few weeks ago I gave it another try and once you get over the initial hump it is amazing. When you have finished Ilium you will surely run out to buy the second part called Olympos. The only thing is that the end of Olympos is a little swift. Hundreds of pages of great story telling and in the last 100 its done. The end is good but it seems a little bit like Dan didn't want to continue any longer, even though I wouldn't know from the top of my head what to change, other than wanting to know more ... I started to really like the characters. Whenever somebody wants ot make that into a film, it will really be the most expensive film ever ;)

Have a good reading time. It's thought provoking in a lot of places.
