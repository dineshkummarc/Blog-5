There we go, the real business model of [MyBlogLog](http://mybloglog.com/)
is out and it is coming to you thanks to Jennifer Slegg from Jensense. In [this post](http://www.jensense.com/archives/2007/02/mybloglog_track.html) she talks about a little bit of code in the general MyBlogLog code you put on your blog. We all know that MyBlogLog will know who comes to your site and from where, which alone is some very interesting information. But the little addition to the code, allows MyBlogLog to track your Google AdSense and Yahoo! Publisher Network ads.

Tracking in this sense means that they know how many ads you serve and how many ads you get as well as on which ads. Based on the Google AdSense click url they know for example where the click is going, the client id, the position on the ad and more. They can also find out the text of the ad. With some additional javascript they also know where on your blog the ad is.

So in the end, they know if people click more on AdSense or YPN ads in similar locations, which formats work best for AdSense, which ads work best, which wording changes for the same keywords and same clients but different ads work best and so on. And the fun thing is that Yahoo! bought MyBlogLog some time ago. Of course, the code seems to have been there beforehand, but hey, this is likely something that Yahoo! is very happy about. They should actually include it in the flicks badges!

The amount of data and the quality (or potential quality) of it is amazing. Even more congratulations on the buy from me!
