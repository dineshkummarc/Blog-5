Another word I use too much here: wow! I got the album now and this is a sound experience. It's not only music but a wall of sound, diverse and challenging. It's like they dug deep into the possibilities of what instruments can do these days, creating a new set of noise with a twist that might sound like trash to some and music to the ears of others. The concert on the 6th of October will be loud, no doubt about it. And it will be a challenge for the sound technicians. This is definitely not an album for everyone, but I like it, as you might have found out by now. It's different. Once again, [Living Colour](http://www.livingcolournet.com/) is pushing the boundaries with Colleidoscope. I bow before you guys!
