Ok, no it isn't. The price is crazy already, but ... but ... but ... what if they become the biggest free ISP in the world, pushing the internet on their own network. Business 2.0 has article entitled &lt;a title=&quot;Business 2.0 :: Magazine Article :: What's Next ::  Free Wi-Fi? Get Ready for GoogleNet. &quot; href=&quot;http://www.business2.com/b2/web/articles/0,17863,1093558,00.html&quot;&gt;&lt;I&gt;Free Wi-Fi? Get Ready for GoogleNet&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it does make you think. I just talked with [Ingmar](http://bornholz.typepad.com/) and the thinking cleared a bit further just now. 

Imagine a company, with oodles of servers sitting in data centers all around the world, pushing out huge amounts of data, paying huge bandwidth fees. An alternate strategy would be to become a giant network and get peering agreements but from what I understand from peering agreements, it means that you only pay for what goes in or out extra. I have 12mbit/s, you have 10mbit/s, so I pay you 2. I could be wrong, but lets play with it. As the company pushes around so much bandwidth, it starts to not make sense to do a peering agreement as you still end up paying. So you need to get people on your network. Welcome [wifi.google.com](http://wifi.google.com/). Suddenly, people are on the company network, but hey, the internet is still not on the network. Welcome the Google Toolbar with caching. Hey, you have a large part of the internet suddenly on your network. Disallow filesharing with the likes of bittorrent on the network (it's free, so you can say that), and you quasi have the internet on your servers. And as it is your internet you know what happens on your internet. Your internet becomes the internet due to statistics  that can just extrapolate. You become the world. Managing the worlds information then becomes possible.

And that's what you need another $4.2 billion for. :)

Ok, maybe it is still time to invest.
