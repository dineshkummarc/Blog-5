Seems that one of the secrets of Google is &lt;a title=&quot;Yahoo! News - Google's Secret: 'Cheap and Fast' Hardware&quot; href=&quot;http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/pcworld/20031010/tc_pcworld/112891&quot;&gt;'Cheap and Fast' Hardware&lt;/a&gt;. They buy off the shelf stuff, put it in different locations, make it super redundent several times and hence, when one server brakes down, it just did. They have some time to fix it as there are many of that specific server.
