Shozu just got cancelled on my phone, I am now using [ZoneTag](http://zonetag.research.yahoo.com/) from Yahoo! Research. The system is similar to Shozu in that it automatically prompts you if you want to post a photo you took with your phone to Flickr. The nice little thing is that it gets your cell tower id and tries to find out your location. If it doesn't know, you can add it, and it knows it next time. Actually pretty similar to Plazes. As far as I know, they bought lots of the cell tower data in the US to make it easier there. Above that you can have some special action tags, e.g. posts to barcamp group (I can make that tag action:bc via the web interface for example) which are available to me via a list and suggested when I the first characters. All very simple to use. [Here's one of the first photos I uploaded](http://flickr.com/photos/oliver/1192290709/). It includes some default tags, plus my extra &quot;oliver&quot; and all the geo data. Very cool indeed.

Update: and check [this](http://zonetag.research.yahoo.com/zonetagit_how.php). You can log your location and later sync it to your photos :)
