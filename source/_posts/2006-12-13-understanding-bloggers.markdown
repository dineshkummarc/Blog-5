I remember that when chatting with [FranÃ§ois Bayrou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Bayrou) at le web 3, Loic appologized as he had previously thought that Mr. Bayrou would only be coming to such events for the press, but he now understood that he came for the bloggers. And I have to agree, that Mr. Bayrou was the guy that came to le web 3 for a conversation on stage and with the audience. Mr. [Nikolas Sarkozy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Sarkozy) however, who is the candidate that Loic is supporting in this years elections, and while I do not want to talk about political opinions, Mr. Sarkozy has clearly not understood the bloggers! So if understanding what blogging changes is something that influences Loic's decision, then I would say that Sarkozy is out of the race. Mr. Bayrou was clearly more in tune with the audience.

And beyond that, just read David Weinbergers [summary](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/leweb_sarkousi_conservative_ca.html) of the monologue of Mr. Sarkozy. As David says, he is contradicting himself every step of the way. I love this bit.

&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot; color=&quot;#330000&quot;&gt;Let us make the new Internet continent the continent of new liberties, that includes rather than excludes. Let us make the Internet continent of the transmission of knowledge, and not the transmission of lies. The continent of sharing of cultures, not of the leveling of values. [&lt;em&gt;Wow. Does he know he's contradicting himself sentence after sentence?&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;

Wow. All very strange.Â Â  Â  &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Sarkozy&quot; /&gt;
