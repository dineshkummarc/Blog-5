Omid is the business guy behind Google and John did an interview with him which you can find here: &lt;a title=&quot;John Battelle's Searchblog: Titans Column: Omid Kordestani&quot; href=&quot;http://battellemedia.com/archives/001974.php&quot;&gt;John Battelle's Searchblog: Titans Column: Omid Kordestani&lt;/a&gt;.

One part of it actually rang a bell:

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://battellemedia.com/archives/001974.php&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measurability of online advertising will extend broadly to all areas of media. You have companies spending billions of dollars on television. As more and more consumers adopt technologies like TiVo, I think you'll be able to have much more useful forms of advertising -- more targeted, more measurable, and with new pricing models. Just imagine if we made it possible for our advertisers to quickly publish relevant ads that could range from the local plumber on one end to Super Bowl commercials on the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I absolutely agree. A lot of things will open up for performance advertising. We will just need to exploit technology to allow us to do that. Did you know for example that easyJet prints different phone numbers on posters everywhere to be able to track which ones and where work best? Did you know that Jamba seems to be booking their ring tone ads on a performance basis on TV channels? And this is just the start. Just imagine if you can set up an API to let your ad be automatically queried from your servers just seconds before it runs on TV.
