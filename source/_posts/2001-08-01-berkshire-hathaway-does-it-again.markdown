Hmmm... Bershire Hathaway just bought XTRA Corp.

&lt;I&gt;Xtra Corporation leases, primarily on an operating basis, freight transportation equipment including over-the- road trailers, intermodal trailers, chassis and domestic containers and marine containers.&lt;/I&gt;

They bought it in a $590 million cash deal. Everything. Fun. Warren Buffet rocks :)

Here is a good story about it: http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2001/foth010801.htm
