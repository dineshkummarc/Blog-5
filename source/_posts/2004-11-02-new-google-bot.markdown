I seem to be seeing a new Google Bot in some logs. Anyone else see that?

&lt;I&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)&lt;/I&gt;

I haven't seen the Mozilla/5.0 compatible bit before. Might that be that they now track JavaScript stuff too? I heard rumors about that previously.
