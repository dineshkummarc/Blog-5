Was eTech the conference of the future? I doubt it. It was likely more a case of lots of extroverted people in one place, which can be a huge amount of fun especially if they are all experienced conference goers, speakers and the like, meaning that they know how to have a fruitful discussion. If you want to know more about what eTech was like, [Loic Le Meur summarized his experience of eTech very well](http://www.u-blog.net/loic/note/57224).
