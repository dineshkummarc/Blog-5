We just arrived at the belgium cost. The weather is not too good but at least it is not raining. There is a lot of wind though which will be fun to play with the kite. It was also nice for walking around on the sea front, especially with the wind blowing directly into you face.

Otherwise the place is just amazing as last time and I think the following week will be very good. I have a lot to do and read and I think I will get my energy tanks filled up well.

We went out for a nice dinner today too. I had scampi au facon du chef, which were great. Really nice sauce and all. Together with the hoegaarden I am totally feeling like being in Belgium again. Wonderful :)
