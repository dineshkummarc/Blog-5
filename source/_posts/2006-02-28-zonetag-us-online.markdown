Yahoo! has released a new research project called [ZoneTag](http://research.yahoo.com/zonetag/) and as always it is US only. I really have to move to the US some time! :) Automatically tagging my shots with my location would be very cool indeed, and the cellID information seems to be purchasable in most if not all countries. So I hope they will come out with a plan for Germany soon. ([source](http://feeds.feedburner.com/HeikoHebig?m=176))
