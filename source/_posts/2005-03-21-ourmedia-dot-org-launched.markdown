I just found out [via Hugo E. Martin](http://hemartin.blogspot.com/2005/03/grassroot-media-organization.html) that [Ourmedia](http://www.ourmedia.org/) has launched. A good history and short backgrounder is [here](http://www.newmediamusings.com/blog/2005/03/ourmedia_is_her.html).   The site actually explains itself very well in short words:
