From time to time a great post by somebody comes up and this time I even only read at the end that this one is from Clay Shirky who is not unknown in our echo chamber circles. The article is called: [Newspapers and Thinking the Unthinkable](http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/) and it came to me through friends sharing it through the [new Facebook Homepage](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=newfacebook). I'll just let you read the article because in all honestly you need to if you have anything to do with print. If you can't decide, here are some quotes, which I am adding to my quotes list while we are at it ;)

“When a 14 year old kid can blow up your business in his spare time, not because he hates you but because he loves you, then you got a problem.” - Gordy Thompson (cited in an article about the death of print)

There is no general model for newspapers to replace the one the internet just broke. - [Clay Shirky](http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/)

It makes increasingly less sense even to talk about a publishing industry, because the core problem publishing solves — the incredible difficulty, complexity, and expense of making something available to the public — has stopped being a problem. - [Clay Shirky](http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/)

That is what real revolutions are like. The old stuff gets broken faster than the new stuff is put in its place. - [Clay Shirky](http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/)

When we shift our attention from ’save newspapers’ to ’save society’, the imperative changes from ‘preserve the current institutions’ to ‘do whatever works.’ And what works today isn’t the same as what used to work. - [Clay Shirky](http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/)

Now go read damn it!
