I am starting to be very happy with my decision to join Infosync.no. Somehow I can't get off the train to write stuff and be part of some group doing news online in some interesting field. The Infosync.no crew is wonderful and the site is actually going well. You know, you can get companies to by advertising in that field ;)

And I might get some fun gadgets to try out. Already written some articles on mobile payment, bluetooth and currently sitting here educating myself for a knowledgebase writing stuff like the history of GSM, info on Bluetooth, what is GPRS, info on UMTS, ... actually very interesting.

If you want to be hit dead by acronyms, try getting a specification from etsi.org. If you go for something about the interface between a base station and some other base station part that links to the mobile phone then you will really be in deep trouble understanding anything ;)
