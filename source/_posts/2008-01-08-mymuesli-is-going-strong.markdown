They just gained a few new customers it seems. How come? Check out this video I posted on kyte.tv some time ago. It explains it.

I gave some of those to the neighbors and others to team members. I know of at least one person already that's loving this stuff! Thanks again a lot!

P.S.: coolest move they did up till now was send me a few packets of the chocolate that was in the first muesli because my wife, who was just pregnant at the time, loved them ;)
