If a big serial entrepreneur in Europe talks, you should listen. So here are some of the things that [Martin Varsavsky believes in](http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/general/random-things-that-i-believe-in.html):

	* [...]
	* That America is the most productive country in the world until you divide that productivity per hour worked.
	* That America is going broke thanks to lawyers and the military.
	* [...]
	* That the Clintons will run America again and the world will be a better place...again.
	* That thereÂ´s a very weak link between terrorism and lack of opportunity and a very strong link between terrorism....and opportunity.
	* That wealth is the best contraceptive.
	* [...]
	* That we think we know a lot and people in the 1800s did not. But we will look as ignorant to people in 200 years.
	* [...]
	* That the ethics of biodiesel are wrong, that is wrong to feed food to cars in a world in which thereÂ´s starvation.
	* [...]
	* That Europeans make a huge mistake taxing employment so heavily with social charges and that is the main reason for European unemployment.
	* [...]
	* That when children are born democracies should give their vote to their parents until they are 14. The parent will then vote twice, one for themselves and another one for their children. When the children reach 14 they would have the right to vote themselves. It is a well known fact of democracies that the poorest citizens in democracies are children and I believe this is because they are not represented through the voting process.
	* [...]
	* That nuclear energy is not as bad as people think when compared to the alternatives.

Strong words, very interesting ones and great food for thought. Thanks for that bold move Martin. There are too few people that expose themselves for their views because they become vulnerable.
