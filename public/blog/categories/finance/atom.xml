    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&lt;p&gt;Foreign exchange (FX, forex) risk is the risk of a change in value due to variation in exchange rates be it resulting in a cash flow or recorded value difference. There are several exposures possible:
- transaction exposure comes from cash flow changes in relation to contractual obligations.
- translation exposure (aka accounting exposure) comes from translations of foreign accounts into home currency for a group account
- economic exposure (aka operating, strategy exposure) comes from changes in exchange rates having an effect on sales and/or costs and hence company value. Nokia had a growth in sold phones for example but not a very good growth in sales, if any, due to the decline of the USD.</p>

<p>&lt;!-- more --&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Transaction exposure&lt;/b&gt; can be in both product price, invoice and realised profit or loss at conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You create a product -&gt; build stocks -&gt; fix the foreign price [potential transaction exposure] -&gt; receive order -&gt; Invoice [actual transaction exposure] -&gt; receive foreign funds -&gt; exchange into local currency [gain or loss due to exchange rate movements]&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translation exposure&lt;/b&gt; arrises from assets and liabilities available in more than one currency. It is an account concept and results in adjustments to the balance sheet reserves of the parent company. In most countries there is an account standard abou which exchange rates to take in your books and in general you should stick to the true and fair idea, meaning that you shouldn't change the way you pick exchange rates without a real reason.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Economic exposure&lt;/b&gt; is very wide and far ranging, direct or indirect. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To measure your foreign exchange exposure you can for example use spreadsheets including the revenues and costs over several months into the future and the potential changes in linked exchange rates. Economic exposure is harder to pin down, as it can be made up of quantifiable data and less precise information. A strategic DCF model and/or scenario analysis with the help of e.g. Porter's five forces would help here. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market for foreign exchange&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The forex market is very complicated but the book will not try to make a forex trader but to be able to understand one. The market is a framework for buying and selling currencies, with this being possible in many markets world-wide, allowing for around the clock trading. There are two markets, namely the interbank (wholesale) and the client (retail) market. A major market for any currency is the home market and international interbank markets are only found in London, New York and Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In Aprial 1998 the estimated net turnover in the global forex market wsa USD1,490 billion per working day. In relation to that, the International Monetary Fund released numbers for 1994 statingthat the total volume of goods sold world wide was USD4,314.9 billion. 58% of all forex trading happens in London, New York and Tokyo. 83% of the trading in London was interbank.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A speculator's purpose is to take risks on market prices for profit while an arbitrageur is trying to optian risk free profits due to price differences in different markets. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The mechanics of foreign exchange&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;When currencies are bought or sold for immediate delivery (settlement in two working days) they are called spot (exchange) rates. There are two prices, one for buying and one for selling. The direct quote gives you the amount of local currency to buy one unit of foreign currency. In New York, it would be quoted as EUR1 = USD0,9055. The indirect quote gives you the number of units of foreign currency bought with one unit of home currency, e.g. USD1 = EUR1,1523&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The spread between the rates for buying and selling currency (bid and offer spread) represents the dealer's margin. The foreign exchange dealer is the market maker and posting the rates, while the market user takes the rates as given. Bid price is the rate at which the bank buys and the offer rate at which it sells. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;When there isn't liquid market from one currency to another, it might be worthwhile to look at cross rates, meaning that you exchange not directly but via another currency like the USD. You can use simple math to get the next exchange rate. e.g.: EUR/USD * USD/GBP = EUR/GBP. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Another thing are forward exchange contracts, an agreement to deliver a specified amount of one currency for a specified amount of another currency at some future date. This is a forward (exchange) rate. This agreement is binding. If a currency is trading at a discount, the currency is weaker in the forward market, otherwise it would be trading at a premium. Forward rates are either quoted forward outright rate or forward margin: forward outright = Spot + Forward margin&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;All transactiona are booked at the start of the deal, but the settlement of a forward deal is done at the end of the period, but to a price that has been locked in and booked at the beginning. This brings us to an interesthing concept: interest rate parity. This means that the forward rate will reflect the different in interest rates in the two currencies.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Forward Margin (FM) = [(Period in days) * (Spot rate) * (Foreign currency interest - Local currency interest)] / [360 + {Period in days x Local currency interest}]&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This 360 days is just an old habit.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Remember that risk-free gains normally do not arise as arbitrageurs will put them back inline swiftly. There is also risk attached to forwards, e.g. due to the potential default (credit risk) of one of the parties during the deal, meaning you will have to do a new deal to replace the old one. Or the settlement risk when you hold your side but the other party doesn't pay their share. To get arround this risk, banks will reduce your borrowing limit by 5-15% of the forward value. Remember: banks do not charge fees but make their money through the bid-offer spread.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Here are some advantages in relation to forwards:
- fix currency prices
- eliminate risk
- colculate exact domestic currency value&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Premium of the foreign currency means:
- corrency string in foreign market
- exporter will receive more of his local currency in the future
- importer will pay more&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In case of a discount
- currency weaker in foreign market
- exporter will receive less local currency
- importer will pay less local currency. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The decision is led by the policy towards risk. Also, if you calculate the forward rate, and believe that the real rate at the time will be different, then there is a reason to go for such a deal. If you are in a high turnover business, with a small net margin, there is also a good reason to take out a forward cover since your margin might become negative by fluctuations in exchange rates alone. I remember one company with a very low margin business where the finance department actually made a good profit for the books due to good exploitation of the financial markets and hedging.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forecasting foreign exchange rates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Unless you want to hedge all your currency exposure, you need to think about how to decide when to do it. There are four concepts that are said to explain international exchange rates, forming the four-way equivalence model together.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;purchasing power parity&lt;/i&gt; (PPP) is based on the idea that something should cost the same everywhere. Higher inflation will lead to adjustments in the exchange rates so that things cost the same again. In the short term, there are too many market imperfections for PPP to hold, but it does seem to work for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;fisher effect&lt;/i&gt; can be put into a formula:
1 + Nominal rate = (1+Real rate)(1+Expected inflation rate)
The real rates are thought to be the same worldwide, meaning that differences in nominal rates have to come from differences in the expected inflation rate.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The fisher effect together with PPP makes up the International Fisher effect, saying that interest rate differentials will be reflected in forward exchange rates. This means that on top of a devaluaton of the home currency in case of higher inflation, there will also be an increase in home interest rate relative to the foreign market.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;interest rate parity theory&lt;/i&gt; (IRP) is about the idea that the difference between interest rates should be equal to the difference between forward and spot rates of exchange. The arbitrage relationship is key to this parity condition.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Expectations theory&lt;/i&gt; is linked to the EMH, meaning all relevant information is reflected in market rates. So the forward rate of exchange reflects what the spot rate in the future will be. All these four theories together give the four-way equivalence model, meaning that they all come to the same conclusion. (Forward - Spot rates = interest rates difference)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There is actually a Big Mac index, linked to PPP, which actually allows some prediction on future movements. Yes, that's the price of Big Macs in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To forecast future exchange rates, some look at movements in a country's capital account (movements in financial investments) and current account (movements of import and export). e.g. if the current account goes into a deficit, there will be a bigger demand for foreign currency to pay for those imports and that will put pressure on the exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The monetarist approach is about looking at the money supply. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Technical analysis is rather about a long term study of the market over time, with the chartists using graphics of prices and trading volumes. They believe the market takes long to reflect new information, while fundamental analysts state that the EMH would not allow for such a thing to take place. The EMH might not hold on the currency markets though as some countries might support a set currency over the long term. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;If you have different estimates you can combine them in currency histograms, weighting them by their perceived reliability. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forex risk management within the organisation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This depends on how risk averse you are.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Very -&gt; Finance in local currency or hedge
Less -&gt; Potential loss and gain is believed to be minimal or to cancel each other out
Assymetrical -&gt; hedge when interest costs preferable to exchange losses
Aggressive Speculator -&gt; exchange as potential for profit&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Multi-divisional organisations needs to decide on (de)centralisation. Departments need to decide on their exposure to currency risks in relation to foreign production or invoicing in foreign currency or how to make capital available. You choice will be between the foreward rate achieved through hedging and the forecast that exists now. The currency hedging for your company depends on the type of business and the size and makeup of the corporation. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Techniques for exposure management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure netting: Two companies in the same group net off the currency accounts that they owe to each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matching: Similar to netting just that here you are matching receipts and payments in a sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pricing adjustments: You adjust prices to match revenue and costs, establishing them in one currency only. Then of course you have exposure in your profits if you use the foreign currency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Transfer pricing within a company can of course be set fairly liberaly. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchange risk guarantees: If there is a benefit for exporting then government might give guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term borrowing in foreign currencies: Mainly used for reducing economic exposure. you simply finance in USD if your fixed asset are in the US. You also limit transaction exposure for the loan if sales are in the local market. Swaps have a potential here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial instruments: trading in spot, forwards, futures or options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Credit risk and settlement risk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;They are normally lumped together as trade risk. The come from the same route and have a low probability but danger of total loss. You need a cash management system takes care that the security of your cash is protected and it is not lying around more than needed. Most problems of loosing money inside a company are inadvertent mistakes rather than deliberate fraud. Banks record phone calls not due to mistrust but for security and to easily settle disputes. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Trade creditors are normally ranked along with other unsecured creditors. Normally we expect to be paid normally. As current liability creditors we should look at our customer's current assets as they are our source of payments. You can also request a credit report, which should not be seen as a substiture for your own analysis. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Letters of credit allow for reduction of credit risk by interposing one or more banks between the transactions. They are sometimes called documentary credits and there are lots of variants. There are some choices you need to make. Should it be revocable (cancelable before products shipped) or irrevocable. Does the LC remove the recepient from going directly to the customer? LCs can be confirmed (guarantee of both issuing country bank and local one) or advised. It is also most common for the supplier to fund the shipping period and then be paid. Sometimes LCs are used instead of allowing credits. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A letter of guarantee is about a bank guaranteeing a certain amount in relation to certain events.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

    <updated>2004-03-27T15:49:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://thylmann.net/blog/2004/03/27/interest-risk-management-instruments</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are some special instruments for interest risk control, and the ones discussed here are forward rate agreements (FRAs), interest rate futures and swaps. All these are derivatives, meaning that their price movements is derived from the movement in an underlying asset. FRAs are over-the-counter (OTC) deals while futures contracts are exchange-traded. The choice between OTC and exchange-traded derivates involves the decision of convenience against cost as OTCs can be customized to your liking, paying an extra for the privilege.</p>

<p>&lt;!-- more --&gt;</p>

<p>FRAs are agreements between two parties, agreeing to a fixed exchange rate in a future period of time. They will then compensate each other if it is different from the actual. A FRA would be quoted as: 'three against six months', meaning a three month period starting in three months.</p>

<p>Example: I get a FRA from a bank three against six months of 8%. In three months the exchange rate is at 9%, meaning that the bank will pay me back the 1% to give me the 8%. All this does not involve any loan but is simply a contract to compensate for the difference. This deal only helps me make sure that my normal borrowing conditions do not fluctuate with interest rate changes.</p>

<p>In the above example I would then borrow for three months but would get the difference in interest rate at the beginning of the 3 months period, meaning that it has to be discounted as payment is made at the start of the period rather than at maturity. Normally the rate of interest specified in a FRA contract is the LIBOR rate.</p>

<p>{(LIBOR at settlement - Contract rate) x n/365 x Contract amount}   /  {1+ (LIBOR at settlement x n/365)}</p>

<p>The company will still pay the usual spread above LIBOR in its borrowing.</p>

<p>The advantages of FRAs are:
- You do not have to borrow, as this is independant of that action
- You can reverse your FRA by taking an equal an opposite one, called off-setting. They do not eliminate each other but do cancel each other out in terms of profit and loss.
- FRAs are tailored by banks.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Futures&lt;/b&gt; on interest rates and other things are another important option. They developed from forward trading, a contract to deliver a specific quantity of goods at a certain quality in the future at a certain date to a certain price. Futures are standardised forwards with specific size and settlement dates. Future contracts are not made directly but through a clearing house and your position in a futures contract you bought can be closed at once by selling the same. They are very liquid, also due to the clearing house, while forwards might not be sellable when you want to. Very few futures contracts actually reach maturity and 98%+ are closed out before settlement. If there are more futures or forwards in a market, this depends on how important and/or costly tailoring of these derivatives is. Foreign exchange trading is often done in OTC deals while interest rate trading is done in futures.</p>

<p>A little bit more on the &lt;i&gt;clearing house&lt;/i&gt; is in order. In simple, each party trading via the clearing house settles their account at the end of the day to start without a profit or loss at the start of the next day. When going into a deal you normally have to deposit an initial margin and after movements in the market, a &lt;i&gt;marking to market&lt;/i&gt; will happen which puts the account balances back in order by crediting and debiting so called &lt;i&gt;variation margins&lt;/i&gt;. While this requires daily payments from both buyer and seller, they do not need to know each other as everything goes via the clearing house. At delivery time the futures price must equal the real spot price of the underlying goods. Due to the marking to markt, the buyer now has the money to pay for the goods, which would be his early agreed on price plus or minus his gain or loss which was in relation to the spot rate. Due to the big amounts of money that are potentially at place here, while only really working with margin amounts, clearing houses might only work with members who's credit ratings are checked. The margins are normally between 1% and 10% of the position taken.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Short term interest rate futures&lt;/b&gt; are normally priced as 100 minus the futures interest rate, meaning that 8% being the notional rate, a Eurodollar bond would be quoted as 92.00, shrinking to 91.00 if the interest rates on the Eurodollar bond rises to 9%. To make a profit on rising interest rates you need to sell a FRA now and buy it back later. The minimum price fluctuation is a tick, being 0.01%. Actual  cash flows in selling and buying FRAs is only the payment of margins.</p>

<p>There are also &lt;b&gt;long-term interest rate futures&lt;/b&gt;, based on long-term government bonds with 10 to 25 years maturity. With a future you pay to get delivery of something in x months. Futures prices are normallly linked to a given maturity and to a bond that is 'cheapest to deliver' for the maturity. So a sale of a futures contract equals the salve of the underlying CTD bond in x months.</p>

<p>Page 64fff includes a worked example on heading a 4.500.000 EUR loan that needs to be taken out in the future.</p>

<p>&lt;B&gt;SWAPS&lt;/B&gt;</p>

<p>Oh the joy of swaps. There is a single-currency (previously interest rate) and cross-currency (previously currency) swaps. The idea is that two company for example take out a loan but pay each others loan and they both are better off. 80-90% of Eurobonds are part of &quot;bond plus swap&quot; packages. You borrow currencies you don't need and swap them back to those that you need from somebody who has better access to them. You can also swap parts of portfolios of debt. Managing a SWAP-warehouse is a highly skilled taks, a very well-paid one, and allows for example a bank to mix and match different debt contracts in differnet SWAPs, in part or in total.</p>

<p>The general good idea of SWAPs is that it allows the buyer to have access to all markets and savings for the borrowers can comes from different reasons:
- there might be name recognition attached to the corporation in question or the other party, allowing for better access to debt
- there are differences in risk spreads and preferences in fixed and floating-rate debt for single-currency swaps.
- different markets of debt are independent</p>

<p>Following on page 72+ have an example of a single-currency swap and cross-currency swap. (You can find some examples <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=cross-currency+swap+example&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search">here</a>.)</p>

<p>All in all, swap contracts are complicated but they are being standardised and the minimum amounts needed for a profitable swap are going down as the market develops.</p>

    <link href="http://thylmann.net/blog/2004/03/21/risk-assessment/"/>
    <updated>2004-03-21T15:08:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://thylmann.net/blog/2004/03/21/risk-assessment</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Risk is said to come from the Arabic word risq ('anything that has been given to you (by God) and from which you draw profit') or the Latin word risicum (originally referring to challenges to seafarers, potentially with a negative outcome). The concept of risk brought foreward in the book talks about  something that has an uncertain outcome possibly improving or worsening one's position. It has a probability, can be good or bad (ex credit risk, which can only be bad) and involves something changing. The question is how to assess this.</p>

<p>&lt;!-- more --&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Risk mapping&lt;/b&gt; is one potential solution, being an aid to increase the knowledge of risk exposure within the organisation. It is both an idea and a technique. Different risks to look at might be foreign exchange or interest rate risk and actually other internal audits, aimed at potentially suggesting improvements. There are three steps in this:</p>

<ol>
<li>find involved risk categories</li>
<li>estimate size and degree of exposure</li>
<li>rank risks for prioritisation</li>
</ol>


<p>You should always look back to the strategy when doing this.</p>

<p>&lt;i&gt;Risk categories&lt;/i&gt; (suggestion):
- financial: monetary changes due to balances and resource changes, e.g. gearing of different operations and he business
- organisational: industrial relations, labour costs, skill requirements, price/quality, processes, R&amp;D,
- market: Market share, distribution, demand, product range
- Environmental: STEEP</p>

<p>To estimate risk you can take the formula:</p>

<p>Expected return = Sum over all (probability of outcome * value of outcome)</p>

<p>Also keep in mind avoidable risk, which should only be taken if the expected return is positive. In the end, choose the options with the highest expected return.This gives you necessary conditions but not necessarily sufficient ones. There might be catastrophic outcomes attached that you need to avoid, outweighing any potential positive return. As a reminder, in the NPV valuation, you would put the risk into the discount rate. A decision tree will help in finding out about linkages between choices and their implications. At the end, after all your analysis you should be able to answer about your risks:
- Why are you exposed
- What is the size of the exposure
- What are warning signs
- What is the cost of risk
- What are correlations of risks</p>

<p>Then you &lt;i&gt;allocate your risk capacity&lt;/i&gt;, ranking your different risks. The OUBS suggests:
- Unavoidable risk in relation to core activities
- Risk only avoidable by ceasing non-core activities
- Avoidable risk, core activities
- Avoidable risk, non-core activities
- Selectable risk</p>

<p>In a sense you are moving further out of the region of your core capabilities and you must link this ranking to your strategy and appetite for risk.</p>

<p>In the end, while you will never be able to say what your risk is, the market will give a clear indication of what it thinks. It is important to note that strategy still drives the business, while risk mapping allows you to make sure you do not overstep your stated boundaries.</p>

<p>The book then includes a template and some questions to ask for financial risk analysis. The template has the different stakeholder groups on the y-achsis and the different risks on the x-achsis (e.g. forex rate, interest rate, commodity price, equity&amp;funding, ...)</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Interest rate risk&lt;/a&gt; is something that can be managed specifically and also applies for equity investors. This should first bring us to bonds. These can be said to be a &lt;i&gt;securitised evidence of indebtedness&lt;/i&gt;. They normally have maturities between 5 and 15 years and mostly a fixed-rate or floating-rate. As it is securities, it is freely transferable. There are registered bonds, in which the issuer has a registry of who currently owns the bonds and bearer bonds, meaning that they are anonymous and whoever shows up with the paper gets the interest. Bonds normally repay the principal at the end of the period and interest once or at different times of the year. They might be quoted as &quot;Bond1 11/2 2010&quot; being a bond with 5.5% interest maturing 2010. Bonds are normally quoted at prices in relation to 100%, meanign that a bond valued at 95 is traded at 95% of face value.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Duration&lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>To quantify interest rate risk, you can use the measure of duration, introduced by F.R. Macaulay in 1938. In general you already have a coupon rate and mixed with the price and that coupon rate you get a yield to maturity which gives us the IRR of the bond. If the interest rates move, the fair return or YTM changes though and how much it changes depends on the sensitivty of the bond towards interest rates. This  is what duration measures. If your assets equal those of your liabilities and the duration of the both are the same, then your portfolio is immunised. This method can be applied to any know series of cash flows.</p>

<p>The duration is actually the weighted average maturity. That means that the formula is as follows:</p>

<p>D= (1/Price of the bond) * (t_1 * (CF_1 / (1+r)<sup>(t_1))</sup> + ... + t_n * (CF_n / (1+r)<sup>(t_n)))</sup></p>

<p>An easy calculation would be to calculate the present value of the cash flows of a bond over the entire timeframe. Then you multiply each of those results by the time and add that up too. Deviding the later by the former will give your the duration in years. The discount rate should be the yield to maturity of the bond(s).</p>

<p>The rule is:
- The longer the duration, the higher the exposure to interest rate risk
- If the duration is the same, the exposure is the same, independant of sequence of cash flows.</p>

<p>Due to compound interest, the further away a cash flow is, the more exposed it is to interest rate changes. With zero coupon bonds, duration equals maturity. You can also adabt the formula to reflect the changes in value of a portfolio with interest rate changes.</p>

<p>Delta(P) = -D x P x 1/(1+r) x Delte(r)</p>

<p>For a percentage change, simply devide by P. For bigger changes this can be wrong though as it assumes a straight line relationship between price and yield, which is a curve. An immunised portfolio will be good for changes of +/- 1%, which leaves enough time to rebalance your portfolio.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The success of a company depends, at least to a big part, on how efficiently and effectively it's capital resources are used and the CAPEX (captital expenditure) decisions within the company require several functions. This includes marketing, production, services, accounting and finance.</p>

<p>&lt;!-- more --&gt;</p>

<p>Within your CAPEX decision you need to take account for your strategy and you need to link your expenditure clearly to the resources that are available within the enterprise. This means that you might need to sell projects that do not fit your strategy and/or resources. Maccarone (1995) highlighted strategy in the process by saying that the formal CI (capital investment) system is influenced by organisational personnel and strategic planning. The process itself goes from (and back) identification of potential investment, project definition and screening, analysis and acceptance, implementation to monitoring and post audit.</p>

<p>Techniqques for investment appraisal include &lt;i&gt;capital budgeting&lt;/i&gt;, known as the process of evaluating investments. In addition to a decision on spending money, the resulting expenditure requires decisions on where and in what form to raise funds. In your calculation you need to take into account both the timing of the money flows as well as your COC (cost of capital) and qualitative factors. For the calculation itself, the most commonly used techniques are NPV (net present value), IRR (internal rate of return), payback, ARR (accounting rate of return) and PI (profitability index).</p>

<p>NPV is arguably the best method while IRR seems to be the one preferred as it shows the yield of the invested capital. Payback is used a lot as it is so easy to use.</p>

<p>There are several things to take into account when using these techniques. For one, like needs to be compared to like. This means that in relation to inflation, real cash flows fit real discount rate and nominal to nominal. Just as a reminder, nominal means would be 4% for an increase from $100 to $104 while real would be 1% if you add 3% inflation to the mix, as the $104 would not be worth $104 in relation to the $100 you started with.</p>

<p>You also need to remember that interest on debt-funded investments is often tax deductible. These reductions can then be discounted as any cash flow. In internaltion situations, more things need to be taken into account. There might be a foreign project with a substantial cash flow which could not be carried over into the home country due to exchange controls. These might be circumvented via dividends, royalties or management fees, loan repayments or countertrade (Buckley, 1998).</p>

<p>International taxation includes something called withholding tax, which is a tax levied &lt;i&gt;by a country of source on income paid, usually on dividends remitted to the home country of the firm operating in a foreign country&lt;/i&gt; (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/money/tools/bfglosw.html">source</a>). This is part of the reason that taxation and incentives is a major concern for corporations investing abroad.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Capital rationing&lt;/b&gt; is about, as the term says, dealing with constraints due to several potential projects and insufficient funds to finance them all. You could say though that if there is a positive NPV, it is very likely that a company will be able to raise funds, with a major constraint being the fit with the corporate strategy as well as the ability to manage all projects. To choose which projects to do, PI (profitability index) and cost-benefit index are two methods that can be used.</p>

<p>PI = (Net Present Value) / Investment</p>

<p>If you need to invest less to get the same NPV, then this is the better projects. Take into consideration that resources might be constraint over longer or shorter periods of time and that projects might be mutually exclusive or dependent on each other. You also need to take opportunity costs into account, thinking about a make or buy decision, which can also be evaluated via a NPV calculation, taking into account savings in overhead costs. Also take into account that in fast changing markets, there might be flexibility lost by inhouse projects resulting in unexpected costs. Take into account your strategy. Does the project fit? Also consider that you might loose control over your business by outsourcing though? Is this an integral part of your strategy?</p>

<p>Then there are &lt;b&gt;Risk issues&lt;/b&gt; to consider. Buckley (1998) argued that the DCF method does not allow for enough flexibility in a strategic sense, potentially seeing projects as investments into the future. Managers generally are risk-averse, and the discount rate says that a similar return can be achived through another investment at similar risk, which might not be certain. Many organisations use the WACC (weighted average cost of capital) not taking the opportunity cost of the specific project into account as it is difficult to specify correctly.</p>

<p>Ho and Pike (1991) suggest going though a series of steps in a logical mannger: risk identification, application of methods of reducing the risk, risk evaluation and integration of that into the project appraisal. You can use &lt;i&gt;probalistic risk analysis (PRA)&lt;/i&gt; techniques like sensitivity analysis, probability analysis, decision tree analysis and Monte Carlo analysis. Greater risk should lead to greater required return. Normally the discount rate is raised or the payback period shortened. Some company use CAPM (capital asset pricing model) to determine the required discount rate. You can also take several scenarios and calculate an ENPV (expected NPV) including several results and their probabilities.</p>

<p>There might be a case where there is not a now or never NPV result, and in this case opportunites should be seen as options, the right to do something not the obligation. After having started a project it might be irreversible though. This means that the NPV of the project needs to be higher than the value attached to the option of keeping the investment opportunity available.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Funding capital projects&lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>This is the second big part of all of this. You can only invest what you have. So where would it come from? This could be equity, medium- and long-term debt, leasing, grants or a combination of all of them.</p>

<p>In leasing there are several forms. In general the owner of the assets (lessor) allows the use of the asset to the lessee in return for a payment, but retains the ownership of the asset, sometimes resulting in leasing being cheaper than debt. A finance lease is the same as borrowing funds in that the lessor is assured to get her financial outlay plus return while the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the lessee. An operating lease is over a shorter period, less than the economic life of the asset and the lessor retains the rights and awards from ownership. While the benefits received by the lessor might not cover all costs of the assets, the lessor could sellthe asset at the end of the lease.</p>

<p>Reasons for leasing might be:
- funds not available and no access to alternative sources
- considerable tax advantage, also maybe via owning of the asset by the lessor who might have a better tax shield (think derivative SWAPs here, which come later)
- no wish to own
- off-balance-sheet financing and potentially higher ROCE and AUR</p>

<p>All this could be said to be lease versus buy and borrow. You can calculate the NPV of all in and outflows of cash to see what is the better solution.</p>

<p>&lt;i&gt;Project finance&lt;/i&gt; means that you only take earnings and assets of the project as collateral for loans and finance. International banks do that for toll roads, tunnel projects (e.g. Channel Tunnel), theme parks, power stations, ... . A good example is a new exposition of a running miniature rail road which cost 2 million EURs to build but it now taking in 7 millione EURs a year through 700.000 yearly visitors. It was financial entirely by banks. This is normally more expensive than convential debt but could still be lower than a company's overall WACC. Non-resource financing means that financors only have access to cash flows from the project, which is almost unatainable, mostly resulting in limited resource financing. The difference is when a project is abandoned.</p>

<p>In general lenders are attracted because of high fees attached. A lenders analysis will include several types of risks, namely internal (operational, raw material handling, completion/construction) and externally derived (country/political, off-take, market, financial, documentary, force major) risk. A case study in this part of the course is the financing of a liquid gas facility in Oman. Here the risks are too high even for large banks and the risk is reinsured. The principal banks, called arranging banks, underwrite the project and then syndicate to further banks who then sub syndicate for even more banks. The arranging banks take the biggest chunk but distribute the rest.</p>

<p>The banks will take a project base scenario based on reasonable assumptions and build DCFs on a range of financial forecasts. Risk appraisal forms a major part of all of this. The banks might also require contractors to sign off completion guarantees. Country risk is tied to political risk, which is evaluated partly on preceeding deals with the country, and for example a list published in the economist about the risk attached to countries. Perhaps the Word Bank will be involved. Off-take risk is essentially about guaranteeing purchases from the end customers. Market risk is about being able to service interest payments.</p>

<p>The banks (mostly the principal ones) get an arrangement fees, an underwriting fee, a participation fee, a loan spread, commitment fee on the undrawn portion, technical bank fee and administrative roal fee.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Funding public projects&lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>Private equity could also fund public sector projects. This can be in the form of Public Private Partnerships (PPP), which is about exploiting the &lt;i&gt;full range of private sector management, commercial and creative skills. &lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>Public bodies will contract directly with a private organisation, which will accept some of the project's risk against the option to make a profit. The operator might be part of a consortium of different companies and banks who haved bidded for the project together.</p>

<p>Characteristics of this include:
- contractor provides capital investment
- funded by consortium members
- some of the construction risk assumed by operator
- operator has an operating license
- ownership of facility goes to private sector</p>

<p>The interest for the public body is:
- less constraints by government controls in relation to expenditure and borrowing
- exploit the added value via specialist</p>

<p>The public body might get access to funding in the short term but need to pay out large shares of future revenues. The PPP costs and benefits are often ring-fenced like in project finance. The process to go into a PPP is often very complicated and the bidding process can take well over a year. PPP schemes have been both hailed and criticised. A critique might be the money burned in case of the german Arbeitsamt in its consulting deal with Accenture for example, with the project being well 165 million EURs over budget.</p>

<p>Next follows a case study on the london transport system, which concludes this unit.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here we consider a company as a conduit of funds. The higher the risk the higher the return required by investors and hence what the company must achieve. In terms of NPV (net present value), you should only do projects, as a company, that bring a positive NPV. The discount rate you use in your cost of capital, being the average return your equity and debt investors require. With a positive NPV, the project is adding value. It's that simple... ok, almost :)</p>

<p>&lt;!-- more --&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Determining the market cost of equity&lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>First you need to find the risk-free rate of return, which would be something that can be considered a safe investment. Treasury Bills are such a thing, which, given the credit-worthiness of most countries out there can be said to be relatively safe. Nominal interest rates will include an expected inflation and if the real one differs then investors will earn more or less in real terms, being an inflation risk.</p>

<p>For longer periods, government bonds could be taken, which have a given yield to maturity. Once your time horizon changes, you require different returns, called term structure of interest rates.</p>

<p>Then you have the equity risk premium. The equity rate of return could be said to be the rate of return of the stock market, which you can invest in via an index or tracker fund (highly suggested if you are thinking about investing mind you). The difference between the equity rate of return and the risk free rate is the equity risk premium. In the last 100 years or so, this can be said to have been between 5.6% and 6.6%, on average. As both risk free rate and return on equity are influenced by inflation, the premium should be constant.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Determining the individual cost of equity&lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>This can be shown to depend on the return of the share in relation to the market. Harry Markowitz developed the portfolio theory in relation to this, or more clearly, in relation to the benefit that can be gained by combining shares into a portfolio. Several assumptions need to be made here though:
- all investment decisions are made within a single period framework (one time frame)
- more money is preferred to less money
- investors are risk-averse, and hence need an extra return for extra risk
- attraction of shares are measured only by their expected returns and standard deviations (the biggest flaw in the model I'd say and mind you it's a damn good one)</p>

<p>In the end, the risk of an All-Share portfolio is less than the average one of an individual share. The calculations have been seen previously. In general, it's about shares now being 100% correlated in their movements, meaning if one share goes up, another one goes down, and the risk attached to the movedment of them both together is lower than of each one of them. If they have only a small correlation coefficient that is. The correlations coefficient is the covariance (extent to which the shares move together) divided by standard deviation of returns for the shares your are mixing. The value will be between -1 and +1. The lower the correlation, the greater the risk reduction.</p>

<p>Combining shares intelligently, will allow your to lower your risk while not sacrificing return. The set of all portfolios you can take is known as the opportunity set and the edge of that set, in terms of risk and return, is known as the efficient frontier. Efficient as it offers the maximum expected return for the related risk. Optimisation is the mathematical process to maximize return for risk. Even simply picking a few shares, called naive diversification, reduces risk ,as it does not need many shares to reduce the risk considerably. 10 shares give you a risk of only 70% in relation to one share. The more shares you hold the closer your portfolio is like the stock market and you approach both market return and market risk.</p>

<p>The capital asset pricing model (capm) adds to the portfolio theory that a) there is a risk-free asset for all investors and b) that all investors have the same expectations as for the future, meaning that they accept the forecasts made. This also means that everybody would everybody invests in the same portolio of shares, being called M at this time. If you draw a straight line from the risk-free asset (Rf) touching the efficient frontier at M, you get the capital market line. You can now choose your risk and return via buying different distributions of Rf and M, moving your risk/return along the line.</p>

<p>E(Rp) = ÃŸE(Rm) + (1-ÃŸ)Rf = Rf + ÃŸ[E(Rm) - Rf]</p>

<p>For ÃŸ=0 you get the risk free rate. For ÃŸ=1 you get the market portfolio. For ÃŸ&gt;1 you borrow (ÃŸ-1) and invest that in the market.</p>

<p>All in all capm means that you only invest in an index fund and a risk free asset, which is actually rather wise. The other solution would be to believe that different people have different expectations in shares/companies and therefore over or undervalue shares. This is fine on its own, but the problem is that you will also have to be sure that your expectations are &quot;correcter&quot; than the market average.</p>

<p>The security market line can also be drawn, being:</p>

<p>E(Ri) = Rf + ÃŸi[E(Rm) - Rf] where ÃŸi is the beta of the share i (correlation to the return of the stock market).</p>

<p>This security market line implies that the required return for individual shares does not depend on the total risk but just on the risk relative to the market. You therefore can express the exptected return per share via the risk-free rate, the equity risk premium and the share's beta. You can get betas from most stock web sites out there.</p>

<p>Another thing of importance then becomes the alpha, which measures the performance in relation to the security market line. You will then see that the total risk of a share is made up of the beta, market risk and specific risk of the share. As the theory goes, the specific risk will be cancelled out in a diversified portfolio and you then can use the CAPM model.</p>

<p>The next model would be the divident valuation model. This defines the price P of a share as the present value of future dividends, discounted by the RRR.</p>

<p>P = Sum over ( D_1 / ((1+E(R))<sup>n))</sup></p>

<p>The problem here is that you do not know wha the dividends will be and often companies in high growth do not give out dividends in the arguement that the money is better reinvested in the business.</p>

<p>The simplified version of this is the &lt;i&gt;Gordon growth model&lt;/i&gt;, which presumes that you have a constant growth g:</p>

<p>P = D_1 / (E(R) - g)</p>

<p>You can turn this arround to get the RRR for a share taking its dividends as a measurement:</p>

<p>E(R) = (D/P) +g</p>

<p>To find the growth in dividends, take a look at forecasted real growth and expected inflation. This way you can compare across boundaries and allows you to compare the CoE of the Gordon growth model with your result from CAPM.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Capital Structure and WACC&lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>The two main types of finance, dept and equity, make up the capital structure of a company. Debt is normally taken as risk free, even though it isn't. Credit ratings show the danger attributed to the debt resulting in different interest payable on debt. As the risk free rate Treasury Bill yield or LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) is often taken, even though companies with very low risk rating can potentially borrow at below LIBOR.</p>

<p>To determine the future cost of dept one approach is to take historic cost or to take an average x points above risk free.</p>

<p>This brings us to capital structure. The main ratios here are gearing, net gearing, leverage (gross), leverage (tangible), leverage (tangible including contingents) and debt/debt plus equity (dept/equity for short).</p>

<p>Debt/equity ratio = (short- and long-term debt)/(short- and long-term debt + shareholders' equity)</p>

<p>The more commitment there is to pay for debt via cash flows, the more volatile the remaining profits distributable to shareholders will be. A high gearing therefore leads to a higher required return for shareholders. If we introduce corporate tax, with tax-deductible debt interest payments, then the true cost of debt actually lower. This results in a company with debt potentially being worth more than one without.</p>

<p>This would speak for a high gearing, with the only problem being that first of all you need enough profits to show against interest payments and there is the problem of bankrupty if you fail to pay your interest. The more likely a default, the higher the interest rates on debt. You need to weight all of this against each other to have the optimal debt/equity ratio.</p>

<p>Next up comes the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)</p>

<p>R = D/(D+E) x R(debt) (1-T) x E/(D+E) x R(equity)</p>

<p>Here you should use market prices for equity (E) and debt (D). You can also use your long-term debt to equity target ratio in the calculation. Increasing debt/equity ratio reduces the WACC. Sometimes companies use a hurdle rate higher than their WACC in project appraisal. Explanations might be:
- counter over-optimism
- to compensate for negative NPV projects that had to be done
- to factor in options (e.g. not delaying the project a year if possible)
- interest rates change
- riskier projects</p>

<p>Adjustments should be made to the hurdle rate in case there are special risks involved, be they operational risks or financial risks. For operating risk you could for example change the beta of the business that will undertake the project in relation to the market. Also take into account currency and political risks in international businesses. In terms of financial risks, look at asset and equity betas.</p>

<p>ÃŸ(asset) = D/(D+E) x ÃŸ(debt)x(1-T) + E/(D+E) x ÃŸ(equity)</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Dividend policy&lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>Here managers can again influence the financing structure of the company. The first idea is that a dividend today is worth more than a potential gain in the future (tell that to Microsoft though ;)). In the early days, investors only looked at dividends but in 1959 dividend yields dipped below bond yields, showing that investors started looking at capital gains too.</p>

<p>The problem with the argument that higher dividends should result in higher stock price, is that a higher dividend does not really have an impact on the business risk of a company. In light of taxes there is a change in the equity structure of a business though due to dividend payments. There is actually a tax disadvantage due to the fact that dividends are taxes first through corporation tax and then by the shareholder as income tax.</p>

<p>In this game though it is important to know that taxes play a big role and this also means that it might change from time to time if it is wise to pay dividends or not.</p>

<p>In terms of agency theory, it can be argued that management might use dividend payments to make belief that they are acting in the interest of the shareholders. Also shareholders might like to drain the company of a bit of cash to have management go to standard markets for debt, giving their projects a mor thorough look.</p>

<p>Signalling theory by Miller and Modigliani (1961) suggest that dividends are used to convey information about future earnings. Management cannot pass out certain information and this is how they could in a secret way.</p>
