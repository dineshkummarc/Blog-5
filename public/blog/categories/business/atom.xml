    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&lt;p&gt;Matt Mullenweg has a great post called <a href="http://ma.tt/2009/08/starting-a-bank/">Starting a Bank</a> and I'd love it if he would think more about it. Of course having used Citibank some time ago, I know how much US banking interfaces must suck, at least compared to stuff like Comdirect. In Germany <a href="https://ficoba.fidor.de/">Ficoba</a> might actually be going down that route a little bit. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;What the focus should be is really a bank by the people for the people. Hell, make it a non profit if you have to. Many people would love to have somebody take care of their money in a transparent way. Possibly the system could even use other banks. e.g. if you want to trade stocks, you can do so but it will be handled via different systems wherever it is cheapest. Above that it would be all public what costs the bank what and you just carry that cost and add something like $5 per month just because you get everything very cheap and how no hidden costs.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then add the Mint way to give you suggestions on how to save money. There would be a lot of ways to make money and if it could be bootstrapped then you wouldn't need to please investors. Can it possibly even be open source?&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Maybe you take two companies, like one building the first bank based on the second company that just has APIs and acts more like a VISA system. Creating a standard that any new bank can use. But there are most likely already banking services available somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Please continue thinking people. This is one market really in need of some radical changes.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

    <link href="http://thylmann.net/blog/2009/08/18/the-perfect-term-sheet/"/>
    <updated>2009-08-18T07:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://thylmann.net/blog/2009/08/18/the-perfect-term-sheet</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&lt;p&gt;It does not exist, obviously, because perfect is different for everyone involved, but there is a great discussion going on at the moment how something as close as possible to perfect could look like. Thing biggest thing I agree with is that there should be a good template to use because these things are so freaking expensive, especially because lawyers from two different sides are payed to drag the talks along as they are paid by the hour, so you really have to have good lawyers and make sure they understand that this is about an easy deal.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I am very fortunate to have had good contracts, with wonderful investors, but I'd like to link you through the discussion because there is a lot to be learned here.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;It all started with Chris Dixon's wonderful post on &quot;<a href="http://www.cdixon.org/?p=271">Ideal first round funding terms</a>&quot;. He says to make it work like this:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors get common stock or 1x non-participating preferred stock. That really means that if an investor invests a million for 20% and you sell the company for less than 5 million, they get their million plus dividends, and you split the rest, but if you sell for more, they can convert to common and get 20% of whatever the sale price was. While I still think common is best, I get the point here, because what Chris says and I agree, is that getting their million and then still 20% from the rest or even more (multiple liquidation preference of e.g. 3 giving them 3 million before anyone else get something) is just stupid. You are in one boat, or at least you should be. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro rata rights are fully ok too, meaning they can, if they hold 20%, get 20% of the next round to keep their 20%. This is just how this stuff works. Of course you have to understand that in a down round you might end up loosing a lot of shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Founder vesting with acceleration on change of control is really only valid if you have options. But you should be able to sell some of your holdings at some time, with everybody having a right of first refusal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That might end up costing your $10k, which should be the max. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The only thing that should be clear is that an investment contract is full of &quot;communicating pipes&quot; as one investor put it to me. A wonderful term. If they want preferred stock instead of common, the valuation goes up as their downside goes down for example. They might want a term you do not like, then something ends up in the contract they might not like. But as Chris said, it should just be a standard contract and then we can save all of us a lot of time and money.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Chris also suggests going with a law firm that knows startup financing and yes this is very important. As for board seats, which is more a US thing, you should have something like 1 investor, 1 founder, and 1 independent. Possibly make that 2/2/1. This is really something we agreed on here in the voting rights. The idea is that if all investors and one independent director say X, then X is something I as a founder should accept. Sounds harsh, and you can move that around to saying that at least one founder should agree, and then you are fully fine. Just make sure that not everyone has to agree :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Founders salaries should be at a level where the founder cannot really save money, but does not have to think about it either. If angels invest next to VCs they get the same rights excluding control rights. The other option here is to pool people. Because the thing is that it can be a pain to track down 10 angels just to do a small thing because they all have to agree. And these are busy folks. :) Options should be in the contract somewhere so it is sure what else will be distributed.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then discuss valuation and amount raised, so that you are relatively sure that you can beat your post-money valuation in a next round.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;All in all, very good points.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then comes Fred Wilson with <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/08/the-ideal-first-round-term-sheet.html">more points</a>, namely that he agrees (good :)) and that they are actually using something like this. he ads another good point: if your first contract is that simple, further rounds do not have to start complicated. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then comes Brad Feld with <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2009/08/terms-terms-and-first-round-terms.html">his post</a>. The good thing he points out is that what would be even better would be if we really had one set of documents that people agree on. Because even though templates might be similar they are always slightly different. I really hope this will happen as it would make things a lot more simpler. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Another thing would then be somewhere where investors and companies could say that they used that contract for their investment, editing only X and Y. This would mean that both investors and companies could point to it and say: they did it too, now stop arguing.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Oh how easy life would be ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Update: and while I am at it, check out this post by Fred Wilson on <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/08/milestone-based-investing.html">milestone based investing</a>. I couldn't agree more. Especially because you end up discussing milestones in a much too early stage.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[The Twittergate Document Leakage]]></title>
    <link href="http://thylmann.net/blog/2009/07/16/the-twittergate-document-leakage/"/>
    <updated>2009-07-16T07:13:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://thylmann.net/blog/2009/07/16/the-twittergate-document-leakage</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&lt;p&gt;A lot of discussion is going on on the net about the leak of internal <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> documents to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/in-our-inbox-hundreds-of-confidential-twitter-documents/">among others Techcrunch</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;First of all I think that Michael from Techcrunch is handling it very well, both traffic wise for the blog, and ethics wise. He talked about getting the documents which lead to huge discussions about security of the cloud, ethics, passwords, and more. These were good discussions in my mind and important ones at that. But all the time he said he would not publish all of the documents and that which has been published by him up till now is really only things that in my mind he does need to publish. Especially as Scoble already pointed out, others, old school media, <a href="http://friendfeed.com/scobleizer/fbfa10b3/while-lots-of-people-are-giving-techcrunch">have already published</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I really like this bit from <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/15/our-reaction-to-your-reactions-on-the-twitter-confidential-documents-post/">one of Michaels posts</a> about why they will post some of the stuff:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“News is what somebody somewhere wants to suppress; all the rest is advertising,” is something Lord Northcliffe, a newspaper magnate, supposedly said. I agree wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;And remember. This does not mean he wants to publish everything, ethics are still involved.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Interesting to see are <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/15/twitters-financial-forecast-shows-first-revenue-in-q3-1-billion-users-in-2013/">Twitter's financial numbers</a>. They already blew past the user numbers they had guessed they would get, but we will see what the monetization strategy will really be for the next 6 months. Revenue should be trickling in now. I am not too worried though as they only need to make $1-$2 per User per Year to turn a profit, and that should be doable. Hell you can generate highly targeted Leads for well over a hundred USDs or clicks for easily above $1. Corporations will pay for access, ... .&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;What I really like though is Ev's comment on his blog post:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Obviously, these docs are not polished or ready for prime time and they're certainly not revealing some big, secret plan for taking over the world. As Peter Kafka put it, this is &quot;akin to having your underwear drawer rifled: Embarrassing, but no one’s really going to be surprised about what’s in there.&quot; That is an apt analogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I made me remember <a href="http://thylmann.net/blog/2002/4/2/book-review-maverick-by-ricardo-semler.html">Ricardo Semler's book Maverick</a> (or Seven Day Weekend, not sure anymore) in which Ricardo goes on about the openness they are working in. For a pitch to a project they would open up their entire profit/loss calculation, balance sheet whatever because in the end he said, nobody is going to beat you because they know your projections or past numbers. They will beat you because they are better, at execution. This is really what Ev is saying. Hell, now somebody outside knows that they were planning in February to make $400.000 this quarter. Who cares. It's not something you love being out there, but mostly because it is not a learned thing and because people will start questioning you. Above that, plans always come out differently and this might come back haunting them for an IPO, especially if their numbers are worse. But hey, they have $45 million in the bank which will last them another year at current growth rate without revenue. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The biggest lesson: Have good passwords. :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

    <link href="http://thylmann.net/blog/2009/06/05/review-what-would-google-do-by-jeff-jarvis/"/>
    <updated>2009-06-05T11:32:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://thylmann.net/blog/2009/06/05/review-what-would-google-do-by-jeff-jarvis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&lt;p&gt;So this was the first book I read during my last holiday on the beach, having received it as a gift at this years DLD. First of it is important to note that he just signed out Google because they are so successful. This &quot;singled out&quot; leads to the biggest problem as it makes this an opinion piece, not a &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Built-Last-Successful-Visionary-Companies/dp/0887307396">Built to Last</a>&quot; kind of real analysis of a group of companies with comparison group and all. But being a good journalist with lots of relevant experience, his opinions are very valid and should be considered. So with that, here are some of the main themes that stuck for me. As always, this is part review and part rememberall for myself.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Nugget: After Google's Doubleclick acquisition, Google controlled 69% of online ad serving but only 24% of online ad revenue in 2008. I am actually not sure if that is good or bad, with Google often being the saviour of online advertising. This makes it clear that it is mostly working on the low end. You should remember though that Doubleclick probably includes DFA and DFP and some DFP installations have loads of house ads that pull down the revenue but still has ads served. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;First up are relationships and I agree with his notion that customer care is as important as never before because everyone has a voice and is a multiplier. Above that, the link changed everything and his reasoning is that it was just not possible before to link as efficiently and this allows for new ways to distribute and create content. Why write twice? Simple enough but very important to remember. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Nugget: Tom Evslin, who introduced $19.95 unlimited bandwidth at AT&amp;T is quoted as saying: &quot;Explosive web companies - Skype, eBay, Craigslist, Facebook, Amazon, Youtube, Twitter, Flickr and Google itself - don't charge users as much as the market will bear. They charge as little as they can bear.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Jeff's example is an ad network: lower margins -&gt; more companies use your -&gt; you get more sites -&gt; you get critical mass -&gt; you get top advertisers -&gt; higher prices ... . Sadly it's just not true. There are lots of more variables. This exactly has lead to lots of networks that say they have the traffic when they can drop a pixel and give back the ad impression if they do not serve an ad. But higher prices in the end only come from auctions and this only happens if you are constantly overbooked. Sales just does not scale. So being a platform, joining a network is correct, and the example is good two, but the reasoning is wrong. Above that, thinking distributed (aka the widget economy) is important but only if your monetization is not within the widget, which might drive traffic or be a pay for widget or something, but ads in widgets is not something I buy into.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;His next point was the new publicness which I in general agree upon and live my life by, just with a clear barrier between my life and my family. I am still working on a clear strategy to use this in a B2B setting though.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Another good one is that he quotes Zuckerberg as saying that the important thing is &quot;elegant organization&quot; in the sense that everything you can do online already exist, but you need to do it better.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;As a side note, Jeff seems to agree that Agencies live be TV Ads at the moment as they are getting % of their spending and online is so much more complicated, especially as it is measurable. They need to rethink how they work and I know some already do.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You also need to remember that often people will do a lot for free, actually more so than for a little money, as long as they build something, have influence, gain control, help a fellow customer and claim ownership. This fits wonderfully to how customer care should work.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There come the new business realities and it gets very scary here. Watch F<a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/05/my-google-talk-on-disruption.html">red Wilson's talk at Google</a> to get another point of view here. Let me rephrase from what Jeff says, please remember he didn't say it like that but his words with Fred's words ...: You want it all digital, cutting out the middle men, and potentially free, putting loads of people out of business, killing work places, and shrinking the economy, but very profitable at that ... I somehow don't buy that or I just don't want to. This is probably simply because it will get a lot worse before it gets better but it is still very very scary indeed.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In the end you need to get &quot;smart about bits&quot; and that even though you are in retail. Where are your bits? The question is: &quot;Can what you offer be somehow done for free?&quot; If that is the case you need to do it. Where is your value and where your revenue is can be totally different.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then comes the new attitude. Here Weinberger's Corollary sets the start: &quot;There is an inverse relationship between control and trust.&quot; Then comes Jeff in saying: &quot;Abundance breeds quality&quot; and it all falls into place. This once again enforces agile softare development which also means you do not build the mother of all systems but go one step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To continue here I first need to quote Dee Hock: &quot;Mistakes are toothless little things if you recognize and correct them. If you ignore or defend them, they grow fangs and bite.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The thing is that correction enhances credibility and mistakes can be valuable as perfection is costly especially in the terms of opportunities missed. This is of course not true for all mistakes :) &quot;It's not the mistake that matters but what you do about it.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Be honest is something I have said again and again and another point would be to stop the PR talk. It ties in with the next chapter in that we live in new speeds. So mistakes become monsters faster, hence you need to admit sooner and better. Of course he also talks about distribution but just read innovators dillema for that one. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;He ends the book with some interesting thoughts about different industries in terms of how would Google run them. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;He ends: It is only just beginning. I wish I knew how that change will turn out. But I am thrilled to be here today with you to witness its birth.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I agree. Highly suggested book to get.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

    <link href="http://thylmann.net/blog/2009/03/14/the-death-of-the-newspaper/"/>
    <updated>2009-03-14T19:47:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://thylmann.net/blog/2009/03/14/the-death-of-the-newspaper</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&lt;p&gt;From time to time a great post by somebody comes up and this time I even only read at the end that this one is from Clay Shirky who is not unknown in our echo chamber circles. The article is called: <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/">Newspapers and Thinking the Unthinkable</a> and it came to me through friends sharing it through the <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=newfacebook">new Facebook Homepage</a>. I'll just let you read the article because in all honestly you need to if you have anything to do with print. If you can't decide, here are some quotes, which I am adding to my quotes list while we are at it ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;“When a 14 year old kid can blow up your business in his spare time, not because he hates you but because he loves you, then you got a problem.” - Gordy Thompson (cited in an article about the death of print)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There is no general model for newspapers to replace the one the internet just broke. - <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/">Clay Shirky</a>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;It makes increasingly less sense even to talk about a publishing industry, because the core problem publishing solves — the incredible difficulty, complexity, and expense of making something available to the public — has stopped being a problem. - <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/">Clay Shirky</a>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;That is what real revolutions are like. The old stuff gets broken faster than the new stuff is put in its place. - <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/">Clay Shirky</a>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;When we shift our attention from ’save newspapers’ to ’save society’, the imperative changes from ‘preserve the current institutions’ to ‘do whatever works.’ And what works today isn’t the same as what used to work. - <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/">Clay Shirky</a>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Now go read damn it!&lt;/p&gt;</p>
