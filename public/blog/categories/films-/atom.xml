    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&lt;p&gt;I am starting to use my Kindle more and more. Hence it was time to finally write about it. To start with, I have to say that I really like it, just so you have a frame of reference for the rest of this article. I will try to go into some of the bad things as well as things that I would categorize as weird, as well as the good sides, finishing of with some basic ideas of where this will go in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So let's start with the bad and the weird side. This really only comes up when you use the thing for some time. First of all, you need to teach yourself that this is a book. Sadly I am a geek and this is technology. So I carry it around with me at all times. Obviously I forgot it in the office over the weekend. That would never have happened with a book because you would not carry it around with you to all places. As the Kindle has all your books you are then missing all your books. So handle it like a book and keep it at the night stand ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the second point. We all want some kind of haptic feedback with buttons, a kind of clicking sound when we press them. But for this device it might be something you don't want. In bed with my wife, not reading something but more scanning it, can get ... click ... really ... click ... annoying ... click ... for my ... click ... wife. click. In the long run this is not a problem but for now people are not used to books clicking.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;But that is mostly it with the bad sides for me. I really like the device. The most important thing, the reading quality, is really good and on par with paper. Standby/Reading time is great. The wireless works like a charm and buying books was great. Working well is also the Amazon conversion question, though I mostly used the free system where the converted files end up in your mailbox to be moved to the Kindle via USB.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I am actually moving a lot of my &quot;Read Later&quot; items to the Kindle and used it on a recent flight to Zurich as my way to read up on all the articles I still wanted to read. I actually built myself a small Automator Script that takes the current clipboard, creates a text file, attaches it to an email and sends that to my free Kindle e-mail for conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The other great item is the sample chapter bit for books. It brings browsing back to the digital world and I am actually getting some ideas for new interfaces to Amazon that enable that on your browser. This free first chapter and general book wireless transfer to the Kindle is actually something I would want to have for any content I have to admit. Having to move text to the Kindle per USB is a pain and again makes you take the Kindle with you, which again brings you back to the problem I talked about earlier: forgetting the Kindle somewhere. I am currently not doing this wirelessly as it costs too much money for the international version, $0.99 per transfer and MB to be exact. That really needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I really think that this is the first step to a lot of things changing in the future and some things I see as a requirement for future eReaders and improvements to the Kindle, some of which I am sure will be coming.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;h3&gt;Wireless is a must&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The will need to have full wireless for all things and somebody needs to find a solution for sending stuff into the system for free or a good fee (e.g. 5 EURs a month for 100MB and unlimited amount of transfers per month). Only through this will it be something that you leave around everywhere and are sure that it is always synced. This could theoretically also be simple Wifi but ...&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;h3&gt;Global Roaming&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Great treat from Amazon. I will get my books and magazines and articles wherever. On holiday. Before a flight, after a flight. You will want to get them at any time and this is why it needs to be real wireless not only Wifi. Wifi is just not available everywhere and still not easy enough to log in to.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;h3&gt;A New Browsing System&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The sample chapter bit enables digital browsing. I want an interface that allows me to scan racks of book covers, giving me a sample chapter with one click on the cover. This re-enables browsing in the digital world. Somebody build that please, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;h3&gt;Syncing of clippings back into Amazon&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I really like the clipping system and I would love it to sync back into Amazon or somewhere where I can easily get a hold of my clippings. These are a) too valuable to get lost and b) I would often like to add quotes to a Tumbler Blog or somewhere else. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;h3&gt;Better Organization Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I need an option to make folders and things, to be better able to order lots and lots of different articles and things. The defaults are just too chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;h3&gt;Webservice Integration&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I would like to send stuff I read, possibly with clippings attached and everything to things like Evernote. I just don't want to loose these things. I think this is the same for other people. Due to the natur of this things you will want to have further interactions around the book. Looking at comments and clippings from my friends would obviously be nice. Imagine a corporate clipping service running on this.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;All in all there is still a long way in front of us for the perfect device. The Kindle is better than good enough for my taste though. It provides the basics that are needed to get me to change my habits and adapt a new way to read written words. This is what this device does very well and having taken a look at others, and looked at the entire package they offer, the Kindle is the only one that really delivers the goods.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So yes, I would buy it again.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

    <id>http://thylmann.net/blog/2009/10/12/i-just-ordered-the-international-kindle</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&lt;p&gt;I just ordered an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?tag=olivthylsthou-20">International Kindle</a> and boy am I looking forward to it. There has been some discussion going on about the prices for Books in the USA and for example here in Germany. Just <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/oct/09/kindle-charges">read this on the Guardian</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then comes <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/german_chancellor_tells_google_you_cant_just_go_ar.php">our Chancellor talking about book scanning and digital books</a>. Seems like she does not believe that eBooks will ever replace real books.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;As there is too much to say to both these points to put them on Twitter I am blogging again ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Number 1: Hell digital books will put a huge dent into print books. Of course there will still be printed books but they will go the way of vinyl, even though not as drastically and in a longer timeframe. Just listen to Amazon saying that for books that are available digitally and in print, almost 50% of sales are digital! Thinking that the digital revolution will stop at print is nuts.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Number 2: Prices are cheaper in the USA. Yes, they are. It's $9.99 for a NYT best seller. Amazon already stated in the country specific information that e.g. for Germany you pay $11.99 to $13.99 per book, which cheaper ones being available. The thing is that the extra charges might seem steep but you know what? For Germany it is still very cheap. It is actually what is touched upon in the article on RWW above: We have fixed book prices here, and I will have to buy my digital books in the USA for the Kindle, where this is not the case and hence they are way cheaper. This will turn out to be interesting ;) &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So yes, I think they are adding a bit much to the price of the books, but it still makes the books cheap by German standard. You need to remember that they are launching this in 100 countries though AT&amp;T and AT&amp;T is not in Germany. What AT&amp;T does have is so called roaming agreements which are normally really expensive. Hence, downloading a book is more expensive. The added benefit from this comes to us in point Number 3.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Number 3: I can use the Kindle anywhere. Boarding a flight to London, download a few samples, buy the book when in London before flying back. All possible, with no price changes, as this is already prices in through global roaming fees. Just think about the changes coming with that. You no longer need to decide which books to buy before holiday and which to take with you. You load up samples wherever you are, buy whenever you want, and thinking about news papers ... they come to your Kindle no matter which country you are in!!! &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This thing will sell like hot-cakes and change the way you consume news and books. Period. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So here again is my affiliate link ;) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?tag=olivthylsthou-20">Buy the Kindle International Version</a>!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;P.S.: I am not even talking about the social aspects that are surely coming to the device soon.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's actually a way too short post for the blog but hey, I just read that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1010048/">Slumdog Millionaire</a> won 4 Golden Globes <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/15041/slumdog-millionaire-wins-four-golden-globes/">over at The Inquisitr</a> and I need to send out my congratulations.</p>

    <updated>2007-08-30T12:23:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://thylmann.net/blog/2007/08/30/the-allofmp3-saga-continues</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh boy. Let me summarize <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/95176/from/rss09">this post on heise</a> for you. Firstof all to put you in the right mind, it seems that the United States Trade Representative Susan Schwag has told CNET News that as long as sites like AllofMP3 exist, the United States will vote against allowing Russia into the WTO. Strong words. :)</p>

<p>As a few more juicy items, the US worked on Russia to close the site, and Russia did, but it does not seem to be so easy. The thing is that AllofMP3 seems to be legal in Russia, and in the absence of real international copyright law, that kidn of makes it legal it seems. AllofMP3 says that they have license contracts with ROMS and are therefore legal. The industry says that they did not authorize ROMS but that only shows that all is not clear.Â VISA has been forced to handle credit care handling for AllofMP3. The CEO of AllofMP3 has been brought to court, but has been set free with no charges.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how this little play continues. The world is getting smaller and with it, come some problems.</p>

    <link href="http://thylmann.net/blog/2007/08/26/book-review-ilium-slash-olympos-by-dan-simmons/"/>
    <updated>2007-08-26T14:37:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://thylmann.net/blog/2007/08/26/book-review-ilium-slash-olympos-by-dan-simmons</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Once again, I have found another that I truly love. I started reading Ilium well over a year ago and stopped again because it was just confusing. I mean it starts with some small robot under water trying to get away from something huge, a group of people that seem to live in all too happy times and that can teleport (fax), and a little bit of Achilles, Troja, Zeus and other.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I gave it another try and once you get over the initial hump it is amazing. When you have finished Ilium you will surely run out to buy the second part called Olympos. The only thing is that the end of Olympos is a little swift. Hundreds of pages of great story telling and in the last 100 its done. The end is good but it seems a little bit like Dan didn't want to continue any longer, even though I wouldn't know from the top of my head what to change, other than wanting to know more ... I started to really like the characters. Whenever somebody wants ot make that into a film, it will really be the most expensive film ever ;)</p>

<p>Have a good reading time. It's thought provoking in a lot of places.</p>
