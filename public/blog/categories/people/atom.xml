    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>Now itâ€™S your job to move things forward and get the change process under way in your area of responsibility. There is no one best strategy.</p>

<p>Five change strategies were described by Thurley and Wirdenius (1973):
-   Directive strategies: managementâ€™s right to manage change; fast; valuable info lost, resistance
-   Expert strategies: management of change as problem solving; special project team because of expertise and fast; not accepted and resistance
-   Negotiating strategies: bargaining about change; willingness to negotiate; may take longer
-   Educative strategies: managing change means winning hearts and minds; persuasion, education, training and selection; positive commitment; take much longer; takes more resources.
-   Participative strategies: weâ€™re all involved in making the changes; widely accepted; learning; more skills in the decision; opportunities for staff; long, complex, resource intensive</p>

<p>There are several factors that help decide which route to take.
-   Urgency of the situation
-   Degree of opposition
-   Power base
-   Need for information and commitment</p>

<p>You should also see that change does not always generate irreconcilable positions and conflicts, and that debate and opposition are not necessarily band may lead to improvements in the proposed changes.</p>

<p>Here are some of the main reasons why people resist change by Kanter (cited by Lorenz, 1985):
-   Loss of control
-   Loss of face
-   Loss of identity
-   Loss of competence
-   Excessive personal uncertainty
-   Surprise
-   More work
-   Past resentments
-   Unintended consequences
-   Real threats</p>

<p>Resulting strategies are:
-   Avoid unnecessary change
-   Communication and education
-   Participation and involvement
-   Support and development
-   Negotiation and bargaining
-   Building coalitions and alliances
-   Manipulation and co-option (buying off of the outspoken opposition)
-   Explicit and implicit coercion</p>

<p>It seems that manipulation and co-option is just how it is done. Trust versus control.</p>

<p>The best a manager can do is to be as clear and honest as possible with those involved about what has already been decided and about what choices are still to be made or can be influenced, even if this means people are only involved in aspects of the implementation, rather than the change decision itself.</p>

<p>You will also want to encourage a positive involvement and commitment to the change process. But:
-   what are the risks of over-commitment
-   is full agreement necessary
-   should all opposition be overcome</p>

<p>Commitment planning can be done via a chart used to show the level of commitment:
-   Opposed or not committed
-   Let
-   Help
-   Make</p>

<p>O would indicate their current and X their needed position</p>

<p>You might find it useful to:
-   use rewards
-   treat immediate problems
-   be a role model
-   use peer group pressure
-   encourage sharing of positive changes</p>

<p>You should also think about creating a climate for change. Kanter et al (1992) said that you should take the risk of creating a culture and an environment in which everyone in the organisation can initiate and explore changes and innovations.</p>

<p>It is also important to evaluate and monitor change.</p>

<p>A checklist:</p>

<p>Preparing for change
-   maintain a climate of change
-   be alert to problems
-   careful diagnosis
-   consider driver and restraining forces
-   decide on involvement
-   do benefits outweigh costs
-   which strategy</p>

<p>Implementing change
-   decide on goals
-   plan the change and draw a timetable
-   remember cost and look at resources
-   monitor
-   keep a reserve for unexpected things
-   indentify resistance
-   consider methods to lower resistance</p>

<p>Consolidate change
-   monitor
-   modify
-   reinforce and consolidate</p>

    <id>http://thylmann.net/blog/2003/04/03/understanding-change</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>The main problem is that people may not see the need for change or may think the reason is mistaken; it may threaten practices that people value highly; may have unintended consequences; may threaten the interest of some staff. Some see it with enthusiasm others as a threat.</p>

<p>Our reactions will depends on our attitudes and on the circumstances and details.</p>

<p>Kanter et al (1992) identified three different roles in the change process:
-   change strategist or initiator
-   changer implementers
-   change recipients</p>

<p>Typically if you are the middle manager you are the recipient but also have some responsibility for implementing it which is a source of tension.</p>

<p>Our attitudes to change are shaped by what we perceive to be its likely consequences.</p>

<p>To change or not to change? The first problem is if it is warranted and feasible. We often only make sense of change after the fact. When initiating it you do not have the benefit of hindsight.</p>

<p>You may start with a vague â€˜things are not rightâ€™ but only raise difficult issues until you are sure it is necessary which is why sometimes the crisis preleads the change.</p>

<p>Another issue is defining the scope. Where do you stop? Leavittâ€™s diamond provides a useful example. If you make a change in one area you need to consider the likely implications in other areas and the balance between the four components. Task, People, Structures, System.</p>

<p>You can use force-field analysis to assess the prospects. Kurt Lewin suggested that any group is held in balance and that means that it prevents movement.</p>

<p>You have driving forces and restraining forces and want to move the balance from the original state to the desired future state.</p>

<p>It often helps to cluster the forces:
-   personal
-   interpersonal
-   intergroup
-   technological
-   financial
-   organisational
-   environmental</p>

<p>Think about it. Are the driving forces going to grow stronger? Is it realistic to expect that restraining forces to slacken or could they build up? You should try to shift the forces in favor of change. There are may also be no such thing as an equilibrium and different parts will probably change at different rates.</p>

<p>The aim of force-field analysis is not to create well-defined battle lines but to make a realistic, all-round as
sessment of the prospects for change.</p>

<p>Some see the change process as a three-phase model. We set of knowing only roughly where we are headed and a key competence is the ability to tolerate, perhaps to even enjoy a degree of uncertainty and ambiguity.</p>

<p>The best known model is of Lewin (1951). Unfreezing, change or movement and then refreezing. Nowadays preparing, changing and consolidating is preferred as the other wording was too rigid.</p>

<p>Phase 1 â€“ preparing should be about how best to mobilise support for your ideas from your managers, staff and other relevant parties. Leadership and networking will be important as well as communication and providing a sense of direction. This phase is about people coming to terms with the need for change and starting to consider possibilities. Your role will be to contain (neither rejecting nor reinforcing) the feelings and reactions.</p>

<p>Think like this:
Dissatisfaction + Vision of a better future + Safe first step there &gt; cost</p>

<p>It may be possible to mitigate some of the costs by offering more help or assistance to those most affected by the change.</p>

<p>Phase 2 â€“ changing is important is planning and control, managing individuals and groups; exercising power; using your leadership skills; keeping your group in step with external demands; managing decision making; self-awareness  and style. Be prepared to encounter unforeseen factors, unanticipated sources of resistance and unexpected consequences and so on. Build some slack into plans.</p>

<p>Phase 3 â€“ consolidating was described by Kanter et al (1992) as the phase of reinforcement and institutionalisation. Making sure the new behaviours are incorporated in the day-to-day operations.</p>

<p>Hence it is necessary to monitor and take appropriate actions.</p>

    <link href="http://thylmann.net/blog/2003/04/03/leadership/"/>
    <updated>2003-04-03T11:59:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://thylmann.net/blog/2003/04/03/leadership</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>Leadership involves influencing others to follow a particular direction or aim for a particular goa. There are three approaches.</p>

<p>Trait theories is what makes someone an effective leader is their own their own personality and personal qualities; that is, leaders are born, not made. The consensus says that intelligence, initiative, self-confidence, an orientation towards achievement and interpersonal skills are important.</p>

<p>Style theories say that it is peopleâ€™s behaviour rather than their psychological characteristics that determines weather they are effective leaders and this can be described as a concern for task and concern for people. The managerial grid of Blake and Mouton (1962) can be helpful here.</p>

<p>(concern for task/production, concern for people)
-   (1,9): Country club management: production is incidental to lack of conflict and good relationship
-   (1,1) Impoverished management: effective production unobtainable because people are lazy, apathetic and indifferent. Sound and mature relationships are difficult to achieve because human nature being what it is, conflict is inevitable
-   (5,5) Dampened pendulum: Middle of the road, push for production but donâ€™t go all out; give some but not all. Be fair and firm
-   (9,1) Task management: People are a commodity, just like machines. A managerâ€™s responsibility is to plan, direct and control the work of those subordinate to him or her
-   (9,9) Team management: Production is from integration of task and human requirements</p>

<p>Contingency theories say that what constitutes an effective style of leadership will depend on the situation. Early theorist is Fiedler (1967) Favourableness depends on:
-   leader-member relationship
-   task structure
-   the leaderâ€™s position power</p>

<p>He also found that:
-   task oriented leaders perform better in situations which are either very favourable or very unfavourable
-   relationship-oriented leaders perform better in moderate faourableness
-   performance depends on the situation and the style</p>

<p>The most important thing here is that a good leader fits his style to the situation. Fiedler said the style is fixed and the situation should be worked on. Then again, Hersey and Blanchard (1988) disagreed and said the style should be adapted.</p>

<p>Some problems here include:
-   often the manager is not the leader
-   itâ€™s about working effectively not about giving a sense of direction
-   you influence your situation ï¿½ it cannot be objectively analysed</p>

<p>Hoskings (1997) says you should think of leadership as a process. The influence needs to be acceptable and who is regarded as the leader depends on what the leader does and the expectations and perceptions of the followers.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s about tackling core issues:
-   Strategic issues
-   Task issues
-   People or maintenance problem</p>

<p>There are three important implications:
-   A leader is someone who influences how the group tackles the core issues it faces but does not necessarily have formal authority
-   A group can have more than one leader and therefore leadership can be focused or dispersed.
-   Knowledge of the wider environment and an understanding of how it is likely to affect the group is needed. Effective networking and being a good ambassador are important leadership skills.</p>

<ol>
<li>Leadership abilities and skills</li>
</ol>


<p>There are three main functions: strategic, task and interpersonal.</p>

<p>Leadership is about acceptable influence and effective persuasion depends on knowledge and expertise and on developing interpersonal relationships based on mutual trust and understanding.</p>

<p>A personâ€™s ability to lead depends on their influence within a group and their influence outside it. Being an ambassador and being able to communicate your knowledge is very important. You should also be a role model especially in dealing with interpersonal relationships and for establishing shared values and norms of individual performance and behaviour.</p>

<p>Networking builds up from what we learn from other people and they can be a vital resource. Remember that networking is not about friends but rather about friends of friends. There are some things to consider:</p>

<p>Networks and exchange is a social network, a means of making exchanges and each party gains something.
Entering networks have no formal means of joining and you gradually become part by building a relationship. Some members are more influential and are called the gatekeepers.
Choosing networks is important as with too many networks they become an end in itself.
Creating networks only works if people get something out of it.
Networks and equal opportunities is something you should remember as sometimes they have a negative effect as you can become a clique and people may be kept out of networks for gender or race or other things.</p>

<p>Being an ambassador means you represent the group and are a mobiliser and a director of the group.</p>

<p>Communication skills are very important and it is important to be clear. They are needed to influence people. You need to build channels to communicate effectively.</p>

<p>Being a role model is wonderful as whether you know it or not you lead by example. You are more likely to be effective if your deeds match your words.</p>

<p>To maintain morale, cohesion and commitment create a climate in which conflict is handled constructively. You will need to be able to take some criticism and to absorb some of the anxieties and tensions of the group without over-reacting.
You need to keep a sense of proportion and maintain you sense of optimism, enthusiasm and humor. A group needs a clear sense of where things are going what it is they are trying to achieve while believing the objectives to be important.</p>

    <link href="http://thylmann.net/blog/2003/04/03/power-authority-and-influence/"/>
    <updated>2003-04-03T11:58:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://thylmann.net/blog/2003/04/03/power-authority-and-influence</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&lt;p&gt;(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Influence occurs when a person or a group affects what another person or group does and/or thinks.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Power is the potential or capacity of a person or group to influence other people or groups.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Authority is one particular kind of power given to an individual or group.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Power depends on the relationship and the success of using power will depend on the values that you have to offer and the trust and respect in you.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Power also could derive from difference, i.e. a needed specialist.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Power depends on the belief and not on what you actually have at your disposal.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Power is never one sided and other peoples power should not be viewed as negative.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Power is contextual as in the fact that your potential to influence depends on the context of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sources of Power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Classic framework from French and Raven (1960). There are different power bases (sources of power):&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Position and authority: your position entitles you to do certain things, backed by rules, regulations and resources. This is mostly not over people but over tasks and functions that need to be performed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control of resources: Control of any resources is important within and between companies. To reduce peopleâ€™s power of you reduce your dependence on their resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social connections: â€œItâ€™s now what you know but who you know thatâ€™s important.â€? Your capacity to influence will depend on your ability to gather information and mobilise resources and support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertise: being an expert. This is most acceptable but your expertise needs to be recognised. Technical knowledge is about a product or service. Process knowledge is about how to get things done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control of information: people who control information are often called gatekeepers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal characteristics: colleaguesâ€™ respect, loyalty and trust. Charisma or respect for the integrity, judgement and consideration of someone who is influential behind the scenes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You are often driven by a mixture of them. Remember that your sources of power will vary from situation to situation.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Influence strategies â€“ the six Ps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The use of position: influence others by using the authority of your position. Your position to impose rules and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Push strategies attempt to influence by imposing or threatening to impose costs on your target. This will depend on your position and the resources you control and might lead to a climate of fear and distrust.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Pull (reward) strategies are the basis of theories of motivation and depends on the reward being desired and fair. Praise and recognition are often used.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Persuasion is the achievement of influence through appeals to reason. You can draw on your expertise and control of information and the delivery of the argument is important. This is the preferred option because people will do what you want because they believe in what you are trying to do. But avoid assuming that other people share your values, see things like you do and that they are wrong if they disagree.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Preparatory strategies prepare the ground for future attempts at influence possibly by trying to build a positive relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Preventive strategies are for preventing certain action, such as stopping questions being raised, holding back info or suppressing dissent. The danger is that if they are revealed they can lead to a breakdown of openness and trust.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You need to use your power responsibly and the influence you find acceptable will depend on your own values and weather those you are trying to affect find your influence strategies acceptable. You should think of your relationship and the unwritten psychological contract.
-   The nature of your authority and influence
-   Your style of management
-   Reward and punishment
-   Your contribution&lt;/p&gt;</p>

    <updated>2003-04-03T11:57:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://thylmann.net/blog/2003/04/03/working-collaboratively-across-boundaries</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is about two groups purposefully linking up to achieve something.</p>

<p>This involves negotiation of boundaries and can be strategic alliances or intra-organisation learning.</p>

<p>Failure often comes from tension and conflict. But boundaries are about difference and hence some of them have to be overcome like different ways of working or concepts of effectiveness.</p>

<p>Resource-dependency theory is one way of thinking about this as you gain power over the dependence on key resources. They need what others offer. It assumes that actions are taken only when they clearly benefit the interests of the group and that impasse results when interests of two groups are not exactly aligned.</p>

<p>Collaborative advantage is a simple rational exchange between parties, about creating joint value. 1+1 &gt; 2. This can only be achieved by building trusting, open and high-commitment relationships.</p>

<p>There are several stages of collaboration:
-   Seeking agreement
-   Selecting mode
o   Legal form
o   Number of participants
o   Duration
o   Range of joint assets
o   Range of activities
o   Intensity of co-operation
o   Distribution of rights
-   indentifying and attracting partners
-   Evaluation collaborative capability
-   Starting work
o   Structure
o   Action
o   Goals
o   Accountabilities
-   Evaluation collaborative ventures</p>

<p>You should look out at the interdependence of groups as this needs to be equal and noone should only depend on the other. (low, sequential or reciprocal)</p>

<p>There is also a culture in working in a group and you need to foster than and manage it. Policies and culture are important.</p>
