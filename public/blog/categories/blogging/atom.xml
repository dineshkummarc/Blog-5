    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boy oh boy has it been a long time since I have last blogged here. And you know what? The only reason I am writing again is the new Squarespace iPad app :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second part is that a lot of people have put out resolutions that they will start blogging again in 2011 and hell, I might just try to do that too. You can of course follow me on Twitter and all links I tweet or share elsewhere end up in <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:othylmann/">my pinboard</a> account. What I might try to do is go back to a bit deeper analysis. I see this not working already but with this nice of an app ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to reviving this blog :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

    <id>http://thylmann.net/blog/2009/01/16/please-no-conversations-on-twitter</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&lt;p&gt;I love Twitter, hell I even secured myself the wonderful username &quot;<a href="http://twitter.com/o/">o</a>&quot;, which is a naturally scarce username length for those that have not noticed. :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;But that is not what this is about. The thing is that I think there is one relatively simple thing, among others, that makes Twitter so successful: it hinders conversations. I do not mean on a grander scale. It's the wonderful enabler for long-term disconnected conversations. Maybe the more correct term for what twitter does not have so much is &lt;i&gt;chatter&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Yes do you have lots of people talking about stuff that might not be interesting to you, but it is your decision who you want to follow and there is an option to even follow a lot of people and still see what is going on. Perhaps those of us who have grown up in IRC times remember that a chat with 200 people was impossible. Thinking about it and comparing it to twitter, it's as if you had 2 million people in one chat room but you are only seeing those lines of the people you follow. That models brakes conversations over the entire space in a big way and hence keeps down the volume immensely. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The reason I am bringing it up at this point is that I really hope that Twitter will not put too much emphasis on enabling more conversation to happen. It is already happening but not real chitchat among 5 people and that should be something that should not happen. Imagine somebody asking something and then being able to go into the thread of that question and have a discussion easily by referencing that post. For all people just seeing part of that discussion it is totally useless and making the discussion easy means it will happen. So please people of Twitter, make it hard as it is now. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;And while I am at it, please remove Re-Tweets. I admit, I did it once because it is so much easier to Re-Tweet then to write your own words, but that again is the point. It gets too easy. Twitters goal should not be the highest volume of Tweets by each user, but the long term bonding of relationships. This is where possible value comes from. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So how many people that still tweet more than once a week (fully enough) have an increasing number of friends in both direction? That would be the core user group I'd say, next to the echo chamber ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

    <link href="http://thylmann.net/blog/2008/07/06/twitter-versus-friendfeed/"/>
    <updated>2008-07-06T07:46:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://thylmann.net/blog/2008/07/06/twitter-versus-friendfeed</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&lt;p&gt;This is an ongoing discussion and now Michael Arrington is at it <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/05/friendfeed-v-twitter-half-the-followers-in-five-months/">again</a>. This time it is about Friendfeed having taken 5 months for his account to have half as many friends as in twitter, where it has taken 24 months ... now read again. ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Anyway, he is comparing apples with oranges, sorry Michael. Friendfeed is something totally different than Twitter. The oh so wunderful thing about Twitter is that there are NO conversations, or only short ones. That reduces the load on your own cognitive capabilities immensely. You go to twitter to hear what people are doing and possibly ask a question which is answered by a few of them. But there is not discussion forming around that one message.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Friendfeed is a simple aggregation service, and yes, it has a few nice features but at least with the current interface, there is no way to follow that conversation. I have added a lot more people than I would on twitter to Friendfeed, including you, I think, but that is only because I value your opinion and when I search for something on Friendfeed I want your opinion to be part of the answer. I will not be following live what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So these two are totally different things. I believe Twitter can become a new communication medium if they stay true to what they are doing, meaning that they are not making discussions too easy. Friendfeed might replace Google, but not Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>no it won't. Simply as that. Scoble thinks Friendfeed will win, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/25/twitter-2/">Arrington believes in Twitter</a>, so <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/24/blame-friendfeed/">does Steve Gillmor</a>. Now Loic comes in an says <a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2008/05/friendfeed-is-g.html">Friendfeed will kill Google Reader</a>. Enough already people!</p>

<p>I do like Twitter, I do like Friendfeed and I do like Google Reader. And I don't think anyone will kill anyone here. Twitter is a communication system with a very clear focus. The noise level is way higher for Friendfeed and in terms of Google Reader, that's me desciding what to read in terms of sites. These things ar three totally different things and they will hopefully move their seperate ways.</p>

<p>I did start playing with the Friendfeed API though to see what interesting things can be done with it, so I do agree that there is a lot of power behind Friendfeed. But I have been using a similar system with Noserub for some time and I have my install at id.thylmann.net which actually allows me to stay master over my own data, which is something that is totally missed out here. The data Friendfeed aggregates is scary indeed.</p>
