<div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;It is starting to get annoying. Both Google and Apple are just too good at influencing people&#8217;s thinking that I needed to post a few <a href="http://twitter.com/othylmann/status/14546790890">more than 140 characters</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Google just started to push the newest release of Android, 2.2 or Froyo for Frozen Yogurt, to owners of the Nexus One. Sadly <a href="http://twitter.com/teemow">@teemow</a> is currently on holiday so I cannot take a closer look at it in the office, but it is surely nice.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To start off here are the two amazing posts I have read on Android 2.2, Google I/O and the iPhone/Apple:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/techtonicshifts/archive/2010/05/20/sayonara-iphone-why-i-m-switching-to-android.aspx">Sayonara, iPhone: Why I&#8217;m Switching to Android</a>&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/05/post_io_thoughts">Post I/O Thoughts by Gruber</a>&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to start of by commenting on a few of the points from these posts.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Let&#8217;s start with Flash. As I already sent on Twitter, Google is a quasi Adnetwork. Their business is in pleasuring agencies and advertisers in general. Pleasuring consumers is just something they have learnt is the best way to get to the more important point. Agencies are using Flash for ages. They have the right people internally. Those are Flash Designers/Flash Developers and they do not know HTML5 and actually have the wrong skill set in many cases to learn HTML5 efficiently. Google NEEDS flash to work on Android and they couldn&#8217;t care less about draining battery there. If they go to an agency and say: &quot;Let&#8217;s do a million dollar deal for some campaigns via Admob.&quot;, the client answers: &quot;But I really like the idea of iAd.&quot;, they now say: &quot;Sure, you can do that, needs a bit of training, might be interesting, but while you do that, just use us because you can just use your Flash Developers because we know Flash.&quot; Easy sell. Done.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Power drain can be dealt with over time. Actually it just a temporary problem and Google is doing that for the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Tethering is supported by the iPhone too but the network does not want it. Did you ever tether your laptop to your iphone and look at the bandwidth usage? Just Dropbox starting a sync will pull down megabytes that are not happening on the phone. It is absolutely clear that networks do not want Tethering enabled by default. And everybody that complains about AT&amp;T network problems should shut up about Tethering very quickly because it would surely not improve the situation! I would be surprised if the Mifi functionality would arrive anywhere outside of the Nexus One, meaning on the network specific phones.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Still, the Mifi bit is wonderful and Apple should do that. Especially with the iPad they should. I do believe that they don&#8217;t to keep good relations to networks. This is actually also the problem with OTA iTunes, meaning streaming your library. This puts strains on the network. I actually do believe that while it is super geeky and fun, it is three years away to being really usable. For now the priority (if you do not need the press buzz) should be low. Especially if DLNA is continuing its growth, you will have DLNA Harddisks at Home and just need to open up your DLNA device to the outside and you can stream from your home. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;But .. Apple is chasing Google. At the same time, Apple and Google are chasing Nokia in many things! There is one and only one reason why Android sells so well. It is the best touch screen open source thing that can be licensed free by the carriers who can then adopt it to their liking. That&#8217;s why the Nexus One didn&#8217;t sell. Carriers sell phones. Not manufacturers. Carriers/Networks will push them through all the channels they control and make it sell no matter what is on there. Google has noticed that and changed how they sell their phones.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;As for the advertising platform. Come on people. Steve Jobs is just protecting his own market because you know what, GOOGLE IS TAKING OVER THE ADVERTISING WORLD AND CANNOT BE STOPPED! At least hardly by one player alone, which is why we are using a more distributed model at <a href="http://adcloud.com/">Adcloud</a>. It&#8217;s just economies of scale. But that&#8217;s another post. I do believe Apple is delusional though in how they approach it. But let&#8217;s see how it goes. I applaud them for doing it themselves and not caving in to Google.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;On the other side, of course Apple is doing stuff for their own good. That&#8217;s the point in being a business. You can just hope that you can align your own good with that of your other stakeholders. For Google that seems to be working. For Apple it works in the sense that people want great stuff that works without a flaw.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;While Google&#8217;s Cloud-to-Device system is nice, I do see security experts drooling about getting fun stuff into Android and taking it over. But still, the entire cloud thing needs to be dealt with by Apple. I presume they will, but not sure how, especially keeping it easy.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;But there is one positive note to leave at the end. There are two companies at the moment that are almost printing money that are in the phone space: Google and Apple. As Gruber said Microsoft seems to be left in the dust but would have the money. Back to the two big ones. Google bleeds cash via it&#8217;s advertising systems and with Admob it quasi owns the Display (Doubleclick), Text (Adsense) and Mobile (Admob) Market. They just need to make sure that everything is connected to the internet to make more money. As we love stuff on the internet, this is good and good for the mobile ecosystem. Apple on the other side gives us amazing products that just work, asking for a premium for them. See something? Nobody is killing anyone here? Google needs size. They actually need the more normal people rather than the geeks that are raving now. Geeks don&#8217;t click on Ads. But it&#8217;s the first step. Apple needs to remain focussed on their closed system that works.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;As the first article said, Jobs is becoming a bit draconian but I do believe that is what is needed for the iPhone. As much as a love the Android as a Geek, I do know the new iPhone will work and work really well. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;On top of that, both Google and Apple have the money to really innovate, to just hire people because they might end up doing interesting stuff. They need to and that is good. I thank Google for putting pressure on Apple and Carriers (Mifi stuff) but really hope that Apple will not cave and do the same thing they did last time: license the OS, starting copying the Windows system for distribution, &#8230; . That can&#8217;t be it. I have almost only Macs in the office and that is because they just work. Support costs are simply lower. They might not have all the features of others but they just work. I want that in my phone even more so.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
