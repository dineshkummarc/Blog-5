  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Google has <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/our-solutions-for-ad-serving.html">released</a> the <a href="https://google.com/admanager/">Google Ad Manager</a>. It&#8217;s interesting to see that they are announcing it just after their Doubleclick Acquisition closed, because in a sense, they are competing with Doubleclick for Publishers (dfp). Of course, Google&#8217;s offering is free and based on the <a href="https://google.com/admanager/login/en_US/features.html">feature lis</a>t, it is very powerful for a first release. I am currently running <a href="http://openx.org">OpenX</a> here and just submitted a request for access, which I double I will get for blog.thylmann.net as I wasn&#8217;t able to tell them more about me. The New York Times has a <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/13/googles-trojan-horse-let-the-free-ad-serving-begin/">nice article</a> about what the Ad Manager is about for those not fully aware to what the ad serving market looks like.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;d like to add one very important thing though. This is really a way to get to see more pages users view. Each page the Ad Manager is on, independent of whether Google is serving AdSense ads or not, will ping Google about the user information based on Cookies. That is a very important thing because you need to know as much as possible about surfing behaviour of people, and at the moment Yahoo!, and sepecially Microhoo, see people more often. It is not only about how  many people you see, but how often you see them. Do I see 3% of their surfing behaviour or 20%. HUGE difference for targeting systems.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing is that the system will automatically try to make you most money. So if you do not book an ad with a fixed amount of Ad Impressions to be served, Google will optimize everything. I currently don&#8217;t know, and rather don&#8217;t believe, if this will include CPL/CPO ads, in which case the system would be amazing for publishers, also bigger ones, which are missing a solution like that.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This will become one of the biggest if not the biggest ad server in a short time frame. It will be interesting to see what OpenX does with their hosted version once it is out.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;The invitation to the Nokia Idea Generation Workshop came in some time ago and I have now full confirmation as well as a list of other attendees for the event. The general idea is to generate ideas for future mobile products with a timeframe of several years out. With the development of a new phone taking something like 3 years, it has to be a few years out of course. ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Up till now I am wonderfully cared for and all things are settled for a wonderful two days with some really great people. Sadly I will not be able to blog about the contents but can blog about everything around and who is there.  That list alone will tell you that it will be ahrd for the event not to turn out great.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Mika Röykkee is one of their Nokia senior usability people coming from the S60 team and moving to the next generation products. Udo Szabo is senior product manager on the Ovi team. Urpo (Upi) Nokkonen is hardware designer and I seem to have to thank him for the N95 :). Joeske Schellen is designer at Nokia focussing on wearable electronics. Damian Dinning seems to be the oversight man in concepting and planning and is largely focussing on the imaging part of it all. Sami Oinonen is in the innovation acceleration team and is responsible for co-creation activities so I seem to have to thank him for the event (and probably <a href="http://cognections.typepad.com/lifeblog/">charlie</a> for the invitation ;)). Laura Richards is one of their category and consumer understanding people (buy does Nokia have cool department names ;)) and Jarkko Kaislasaari is a product manager that worked on the N95. Of course we can&#8217;t leave out marketing, so Eri Kuwabara is there too. But actually we all do not need to be there because Timo Veikkola is there, and he is Senior Future Specialist, systematically analyzing the world to spot trends &#8230; Our facilitator is Scott Hirsch who seems to have worked on some interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;All in all, this alone gives a great Nokia base to the meeting that will make sure that we have some very productive two days.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;But who got invited? Interesting list to say the least. Dave Green is out gaming guy who also runs <a href="http://snackspot.org.uk">Snackspot</a>, what a cool blog. Christopher Macintosh Morrison is one of the marketing people, having sold the first digital only marketing agency in London to WPP and now has a new one among others doing marketing for mobile social networks. And Mac, once you get the fire eagle beta login I&#8217;d love an invite ;) Vilhelm Sjostrom also comes from the Advertising Agency world and is also pro Photographer. Matt Brown is interaction designer at last.fm, which means lots to learn on that front. Thayer Driver was developer at <a href="http://upmystreet.com/">UpMyStreet</a>, which might lead to interesting discussions to what we are doing, and is focussed on social media, gaming and web 2.0. Dietmar Müllser is part of the ISO digital photography committee, tests cameras and <a href="http://digitalkamera.image-engineering.de/">knows digital</a>. Jim Griffin is the guy holding the talks about the future of music and entertainment delivery it <a href="http://grep.law.harvard.edu/articles/03/11/28/095219.shtml">seems</a>. Sascha Pohflepp studying design interactions and is part of the people behind <a href="http://we-make-money-not-art.com">We Make Money Not Art</a>. Rafe Blandford runs <a href="http://allaboutsymbian.com">All About Symbian</a>. Matt Hunter is Partner at IDEO and I found a fun video about <a href="http://www.designinginteractions.com/interviews/MatHunter">where digital cameras</a> are going. He is also a drummer, like I am, and not playing, because of a sun, like I am ;) Sami Köykkä is a digital services consultant, speaker and author from what I could find, and Moritz Waldemeyer seems to be another interactions designer type of guy that actually seems to have an iPhone based on his <a href="http://waldemeyer.blogspot.com/">blog</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I actually just <a href="http://seesmic.com/v/dMor6r7ZdF">posted a video on Seesmic</a> to ask the question what you think the future phone should look like. Just to possibly get a bit of feedback. :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;I just read two competing views that are actually very similar.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;First the wonderful Charlene Li from Forrester blogged that <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2008/03/the-future-of-s.html">social networks will be like air</a> in the future. She actually has a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/charleneli/the-future-of-social-networks?src=embed">few slides available</a> from a recent talk. In short, she believes that in 8 to 10 years you will look back to Facebook or LinkedIn and wonder what people where doing there because in the end, everything will be social.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The general idea is that the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2007/09/20/open-social-graphs/">Open Social Graph</a> is really something that we need and that the big players will be working on together because having one social graph is really to the benefit of everyone. It&#8217;s really what <a href="http://noserub.com/">Noserub</a>, which one of <a href="https://ormigo.com/">our</a> devs <a href="http://olbertz.de">Dirk</a> has initiated, is all about. This means that in the end the social networks that are just there to be a social network, will die. I am already filling all my social networks with my GMail address book (not inviting people just syncing and seeing how is there) and this really means that my GMail address book is my social network.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;At the same time Cringely wrote his latest piece called <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2008/pulpit_20080307_004467.html">Antisocial</a>. He argues that it is getting too much and boy do I agree. I can&#8217;t join the 50th group or add the 75th application or check who bit whom or what who rated. He really believes that there is just not enough value in all of them. The next big thing will come along faster than you think.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;It ties in wonderfully with something I think John Battelle said recently, that these sites have to start competing on features and not on data. Because in the end, Cringely is right, and Charlene is too. Most of them that are just social networks will die, because there is no reason to have them if you have a social graph underlying your life. This is really why we have built <a href="https://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a> over a social network. We are no social network as such because that is not where the value comes from, but we are a local market place and local market places of the future will have to be built on social networks, because local is inherently social.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Our value does not directly come from the social network but rather it is one of many features. The value comes from giving you the best local merchants to solve your current problem. Social connections, analysis of the life stream of user and merchant, and so on, in the long run, will be important to do this correctly. Interesting times ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Update: And yes, that means that there will be lots of features, systems, sites out there that will just use social components. This is exactly what Facebook is about. Just read <a href="http://valleywag.com/365644/mark-zuckerberg-sxsw-keynote">this</a> from Zuckerberg:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;blockquote&gt;Beacon isn&#8217;t even a part of our ad team. It&#8217;s part of our platform team. We think these large social networking sites are going from large monolithic sites like facebook.com &#8230; to social services. A lot of them aren&#8217;t even things we&#8217;re building. Some of them are going to be inside facebook.com. An increasing amount of that is going to be outside facebook.com. What we were trying to do with Beacon was taking the first step with letting people take actions on other parts of the Web and feed back into what their friends are doing. It also ties into the ad system, because it can be an endorsement &#8211; someone you care about is doing something, that&#8217;s much more effective.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is what an <a href="http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&amp;amp;art_aid=78035">article on MediaPost</a> (my <a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/3/google__buying_doubleclick__still_not_an_ad_agency">source</a>) talks about. In the article Google&#8217;s President of Advertising and Commerce for North America, Tim Armstrong talks about Google&#8217;s future Ads Dashboard at the American Association of Advertising Agencies Media Conference. And that&#8217;s a cool crowd to talk about what the biggest threat to Agencies will be doing, especially when they really want the agencies on their side &#8230; at least until they don&#8217;t need them anymore.</p>

<p>What they want to bring out is a kind of dashboard that helps Agencies to plan, buy and manage all their advertising, be it search, display, radio, tv or anything other that comes. The integration helps show agencies how different parts of the mix influence each other. That is actually what GroupM from WPP is working on. Of course Google is saying that they want to help agencies, and GroupM is obviously mostly helping it&#8217;s connected agencies. I need to write a bit about GroupM in the future, seems to be an amazing place!</p>

<p>While I do believe that Google has nothing against the agencies because they will not be able to hire enough sales guys to do it alone, they will not be needed in the end. You might need a Creative Agency, but that will be the only ones still making a margin and not being replacable. Now already, the big clients will milk an agency for it&#8217;s last cent, knowing exactly what they pay for advertising, and being a hard bargainer. When all the agencies out there use one Dashboard to manage the ads, management, buying, and so on becomes a no brainer. They can only distinguish themselves via being more creative and being more knowledgeable to build a great integrated campaign. Trafficking is an art form (it is what GroupM does) and the thing is that the big publishers will not let a Google rid them of their direct access to the agencies and customers.</p>

<p>But if you will not be able to use Google&#8217;s tool to directly bid on big publishers (you might be able to use it to track them due to their Doubleclick ownership, think Doubleclick for Agencies which they already use anyway, now it will be free) where do you book? Google needs somewhere for automatic booking, especially for image ads.</p>

<p>That is really a threat for all the networks forming at the moment. I am talking about an AdJug, AdScale, AdBrite and so on. Either they need to develop an API to hook themselves up to the Google Dashboard, or they will have a real problem. Because Google does need all the same small to mid publishers to fill their booking engine. And with all the Agencies connected, they will be able to pay better. One thing that Google AdSense is missing now is an option to say &quot;only accept ads with CPM over X&quot;, which things like AdScale do. Of course, nobody has yet been able to explain to me how they do it with CPC Ads, but ok, I think it is something Google could do if they do want to reach beyond being the back fill.</p>

<p>Of course continuing down that line of thinking, the next extension then might mean that the big publishers will need to open up for Google&#8217;s Dashboard. And then suddenly it is all automated and then you don&#8217;t need Agencies anymore. Creative Agencies yes, but that might be it.</p>

<p>Yes, Google does need the agencies, but they will make sure that their tools are so easy that the agencies are easily replaced and ad management is not a margin business &#8230; not for anyone but Google that is.</p>

<p>Or it just stays a wining-and-dining business for a long time to come. ;)</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is actually <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2008/03/07/how-to-save-money-running-a-startup-17-really-good-tips/">Jason Calacanis&#8217; list</a>, but because I am reading lots of good stuff from him in recent times, I thought I&#8217;d see how we score at <a href="https://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a>.
&lt;ol&gt;</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Every employee uses their own computer, so we actually do not have lots of windows systems. I actually think we score very well here especially with several macs and lots of ubuntu machines :)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Everybody gets a second monitor. Score. Very important actually.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We don't do the buying lunch bit ... need to think about that.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Cheap tables and expensive chairs ... yep. Check.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We have a phone system, but it's an asterisk system and with a call center, and thousands of local market customers that need caring, you need a phone system. I think I can safely say this point does not apply to us ;) And yes, the devs do have one phone between them and their Ormigo number is forwarded to their mobile phone.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We don't rent out extra space, because our contract allows us to block the extra space without paying for it, so I do not need to rent it out. Too much hassle anyway.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Accounting and HR is outsourced.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Yes only the people that really really need it have MS Office.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Yes we have Google Hosted with Docs, eMail and more. For now we actually use the free version.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;All employees actually get a laptop. It really does not make such a difference if you believe everyone should have two monitors and you don't need a huge amount of CPU power. But did I say I hate designers? Huge Monitors, Photoshop, + + + ... it ads up ;)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We hire only passionate people, and that is very close to workaholics. It pays having people not being able to not think about stuff they do. (Update: but we actually encourage people to have a life!)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Yes we do have a good coffee machine ... and a Wii actually ;)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We don't have sodas at this time, only water.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;People choose when they want to come to work and they can have home office time if they think it will help them achieve their goals. The devs like it when they have very clear work backlogs that need implementation focus.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We do get special deals at our vendors already, but I will put this on my focus list.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We didn't use recruiters yet, and hey, we are looking for some people again. Actually a system admin, a producer, and another php developer. The last one is not [posted](http://blog.ormigo.com/jobs/) yet.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We haven't put a focus on PR yet actually. The consumer focusing part of the system is not far enough developed yet.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
</code></pre>

<p>&lt;/ol&gt;
So, not bad. The only thing I need to think about is discounts from vendors, and possibly more drinks and free food. Thanks Jason.</p>

<p>Update 2: See <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/03/07/calacanis-fires-people-who-have-a-life/">this Techcrunch</a> post for some good points and some very suggested links at 37Signals and others. And Jason has a <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2008/03/07/can-you-have-a-life-and-work-at-a-startup-company/">very good follow</a> up to make is point clearer. I commented there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that is a good one! 2 hours ago <a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Robert Scoble</a> drove with Elon Musk in the first product <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/">Tesla</a> and <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/">Jason Calacanis</a> was trying to keep up in his Corvette. They streamed the entire fun on the Nokia N95 streaming live in Qik. Looking forward to chatting about stuff like that with Nokia mid next month, when I am in London to talk about the future mobile phone (3-5 years) that Nokia should bring out.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2007/07/03/we-need-a-small-little-change-to-banner-serving/">wrote about the ad market needing a change</a> in July of last year, and now Emre Sokullu explained the idea very well in his post entitled <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/plan_b_for_microsoft_split_up_the_advertising_atom.php">Plan B for Microsoft: Split up the Advertising Atom</a>.</p>

<p>He take the Microhoo deal as a starting point, thinking about how Microsoft can beat Google, but it&#8217;s not really something that is unique to Microhoo. The suggestion he has is something that is bigger than Google, bigger than any advertising system out there. Think VISA for advertising.</p>

<p>His idea is best explained via the picture below from his post:</p>

<p>&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/openad-model.jpg&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; width=&quot;543&quot; /&gt;</p>

<p>The idea is that you split everything up, and create it around a standard so that the different silos can interact. The cool thing is that this is how our AdServer at <a href="https://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a> is structured, first because it makes for an amazingly efficient ad server that runs on Amazon&#8217;s Web Services Infrastructure, and it provides for some interesting new possibilities.</p>

<p>Our products that we advertise are within different objects stored on S3 (inventory silo) and the Placement Silo is really our AdServer that holds all the information about the Placements. The very cool thing about the above model is that you can have different inventories fill the same placement, or add on top of that different parameter silos that take care of optimization. Thing content match or behavioural targeting.</p>

<p>The cool thing is that you would enable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_innovation">Open Innovation</a>. Of course there are lots of things still to be thought out to make it really open, meaning you make it a VISA model in which everybody can use everything and can do what they want with it but they will need to adhere to a set of rules and standards. This might make prices more transparent, and open up for real competition, which will not be good for everyone. But the thing is that it enables is a really open market place where different people can write a Placement Silo for TV ads that suddenly grab the right Ads from the Inventory Silo, optimized through a Facebook Parameter Silo to only show ads my Friends like. Who gets what? Who pays what? What about the wining and dining part of advertising? Lots of things not settled, but worth thinking about.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The guys from <a href="http://hitflip.de">Hitflip</a> started another <a href="http://www.blogitzeljagd.de/blogitzeljagd-2">Blogschnitzeljagd</a>. I learned about it <a href="http://dittes.info/blog/2008/02/05/blogitzeljagd-2/">here</a>. The idea is a little hunt for maps on different sites, which you then link to and can win prices. This of course leads to a very healthy page rank boost for the sites and it&#8217;s a fun little game. Based on the <a href="http://www.blogitzeljagd.de/preise">prizes</a> you can win I of course need to participate. Here are the different maps:

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The cries are going back and forth and it&#8217;s fun to watch. Of course we all know the offer done by Microsoft, being close to $45 billion for Yahoo! Google obviously couldn&#8217;t let it rest and now has an official response entitled: <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/yahoo-and-future-of-internet.html">Yahoo! and the future of the internet</a>.</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;Could Microsoft now attempt to exert the same sort of inappropriate and illegal influence over the Internet that it did with the PC?&lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>Like <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/02/03/google-cries-wolf-on-microsoft-yahoo-deal-irony-comes-up-blank-in-google-search/">Michael</a> I can more or less smile at that because with Google having a 40% market share of internet advertising revenues, something like Microhoo would only be good competition against Google, which they of course don&#8217;t like. The bigger question really is how to integrate all of them and there I am <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/003610.php">with John Battelle</a> with the idea that Microsoft should become more like GE. They are already on their way but they can push it. Let&#8217;s see how this one will continue.</p>

<p>Of course now Microsoft already did their <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/feb08/02-03Statement.mspx?rss_fdn=Press%20Releases">counterpounch</a> just if you care :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;I will now try to explain to you the cash cow that is <a href="http://telebid.com/">Telebid</a>, a new company backed by Wellington Partners. For now, I do believe, that they are all very happy indeed, even though user churn is likely high, and there is a risk of being put into the gambling pot. But let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Telebid is a new kind of auction in that you can say &quot;Bid&quot;, meaning you pay 0.50 EURs and the bid on the product increases 0,10 EURs. So yes, each bid costs. The auctions are all timed, and when somebody bids, the remaining time increases a bit, meaning that an auction can run for a very long time. Then there are some special things like a &quot;Fixed Price Auction&quot;, meaning that the last bidder remaining, with nobody bidding again, will win, and get the product for a fixed price.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;All this sounds very weird indeed but if you do the math on a few products you will be utterly amazed. All the products in the system are made available by Telebid. So let&#8217;s do a little calculation.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A nice item is an LCD TV and Telebid might be giving that one away for a fixed price of 99 EURs, even though it would normally cost 1200 EURs. Guess what, that sounds like a very attractive deal and so lots of people start bidding on the TV. In the end, the final bid is 280 EURs. Still looks very attractive. But let&#8217;s do the math.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The final bidder now paid 99 EURs, plus his bids. As each bid increases the price by 10 cents and prices start at 0 EURs, 280 EURs final bid means 2800 bids. As each bid costs 0,50 EURs, that&#8217;s a total of 1400 EURs of bids. Of course not all of those come from the winner, so she might have gotten a deal, but in total, Telebid made 1499 EURs on a TV that costs 1200 EUR (and probably less) in a standard store.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The most amazing auction I have seen a short while ago was a fixed price auction for a nokia n95 black 8gb. The winner got it for 1 EUR. The phone costs 799 EURs. The final bid price was 1161.50 EURs, meaning 11615 bids, or 5807,50 EURs&#8230; for Telebid.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;But based on the new law on lotteries, they probably need a license. <a href="http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/STK/DE/Service/Presse/PI/PDF/2007/MP/070710__stk__mp__staatsvertrag__gluecksspiel,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf">The &quot;Staatsvertrags zum Glücksspiel in Deutschland</a> will give more detail in german.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Here is a quote: &quot;Ein Glücksspiel liegt vor, wenn im Rahmen eines Spiels für den Erwerb einer Ge-
winnchance ein Entgelt verlangt wird und die Entscheidung über den Gewinn ganz o-
der überwiegend vom Zufall abhängt. Die Entscheidung über den Gewinn hängt in je-
dem Fall vom Zufall ab, wenn dafür der ungewisse Eintritt oder Ausgang zukünftiger
Ereignisse maßgeblich ist. Auch Wetten gegen Entgelt auf den Eintritt oder Ausgang
eines zukünftigen Ereignisses sind Glücksspiele.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Translation: Gambling is when the chance to win requires paying a fee and winning is largely dependent on chance. Chance is given when events in the future that are uncertain decide if you win. That sounds very much like what Telebid does.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;As they say, when something sounds too good to by true, it probably is.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;P.S.: my brother just told me that we talked about something like this 5 years ago with two friends but came to the gambling bit back then already. damn. :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Update 2009-08: Actually by now they have a new name called Swoopo and it seems to not be gambling because users decide when an auction ends, not chance alone, even though for you it might feel like chance :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
