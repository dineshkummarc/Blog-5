  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;found on <a href="http://www.fool.com/">TMF</a> Boards:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls. He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was.
So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was.
The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up the remaining space. He asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with an unanimous &#8216;yes&#8217;. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The professor then produced two cans of beer from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar, effectively filling the space between the sand particles. The students laughed.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Now, said the professor, as the laughter subsided, &quot;I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. &quot;
&quot;The golf balls are the important things - your family, your children, your health, your friends, your favourite passions - things that if everything else were lost, and only they remained, your life would still be full. The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, your car. The sand is everything else - the small stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you put the sand into the jar first,&quot; he continued, &quot;there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take your partner out to dinner. Go out with friends. There will always be time to clean the house and fix the washing. Take care of the golf balls first, the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the beer represented.The professor smiled. &quot;I&#8217;m glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there&#8217;s always room for a couple of beers.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just read an article on <a href="http://www.searchenginewatch.com/searchday/article.php/3095821">The State of the Search Engine Industry</a> at Searchenginewatch.com and was directed, again, to <a href="http://www.teoma.com/">Teoma</a> as a new an upcoming search engine. I really need to look at that a bit closer. The other site they mention is <a href="http://www.singingfish.com/">Singingfish</a>, which is devoted to multimedia search and just hit 2 million queries a day! This really shows the power of multimedia. They ended with saying that IBM is the one to watch in this space and based on what I heard about <a href="http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000911.php">Webfountain</a> up till now. If they can scale it up to personal use then that might really work out quite well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that the HipTop by <a href="http://www.danger.com/">Danger</a> is <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/68/33500.html">coming to Germany</a>. More specifically to E-Plus. As I already said some time ago in an article on <a href="http://www.infosync.no/">infoSync</a>, it will be hard for Danger to land a deal in Germany though because of the GPRS flat-rate requirement for the Danger HipTop. The thing is that the device synchronizes everything you do with a Server and therefore you need a GPRS flatrate as you cannot really control your expenses otherwise. Now E-Plus in Germany has jumped on the train and will offer a GPRS flatrate with the device. Jummy. I will have to look at this, even though I don&#8217;t really like the HipTop too much :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lots of blogging stuff today. Scobleizer has been <a href="http://www.baselinemag.com/article2/0,3959,1357817,00.asp">featured by Baseline</a>.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;The most powerful piece of software inside Microsoft may be the $40 application from a tiny vendor called Userland that Robert Scoble uses to write his weblog. &lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Good article and <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/10/20.html#a5138">Scoble feels the traffic</a> ;)</p>

<p>I agree with the article in many respects: &lt;I&gt;There are some barriers to adoption. Using weblogs means trusting your employees to speak honestly and openly. It means conversing with customers, not just marketing to them. It means even more flattening of your organization. &lt;/I&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seems like <a href="http://blog.txtsolutions.com/">blog.txtsolutions.com</a> is working on a system so everyone can post to any blog software (with the right login of course ;)). I am actually still looking at moblogging but without a camera phone it&#8217;s a little less special. I am still waiting for a good phone to come out and then I will likely enable this little baby here to let me post to it from my mobile including images. But for now, watching the above URL for updates seems like a worthwhile thing.</p>

<p>And while we are at it, you can <a href="http://telephonyonline.com/ar/telecom_beyond_photoplay_mms/index.htm">read this article</a> for a bit more info on the problems moblogging might pose to telcos. It continues to go a lot more deeper into it, including billing problems and the like, only scratching the surface but already giving you an idea of what kind of changes we are looking at.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hotspots rock. I am now in Düsseldorf with friends and we are sitting in the Hotel bar using the Isis Hotspot that is here. It is rather expensive if you go at alone, because it costs 6 EURs for 1 hour. But then again, we found out that 4 people can surf on one card, which doesn&#8217;t make it any less expensive though because these Isis people have figured out that they can just deduct four times the usage time. Damn ;)</p>

<p>In general you just have to get a card with more hours for it to be less expensive and you can use it as often as you want, until the minutes are out. Actually all pretty easy I have to say. The nice thing is that the drinks are good and the music is actually very nice, making this a pleasurable experience. We might stick out a bit though with 4 laptops on the table.</p>

<p>It showed that I love Macs though, as we had no problem logging onto the Hotspot with nocat from the Power and iBook while the two Windows machines did have some problems. Windows Networking just didn&#8217;t like this foreign hotspot and getting an IP address automatically from that Hotspot. Pretty annoying I have to say.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a great weekend though, full of deep tech talk and I am getting closer to value the importance of the XML-XSLT connection in stuff I am currently doing. This is a very powerful connection for flexibility. We are also still thinking about the entire mobile space and gaming within it, which is already rather popular for the simpler games. Phones are now getting somewhere where you can get decent games developed for them, which is obviously good. While the N-Gage might or might not be doing well for Nokia, the entire space will take off sooner or later. Nokia wants to be part of it but I am still wondering if they didn&#8217;t put too much emphasis of sticking with their general platform for the N-Gage in relation to creating something really valuable. I understand their drive for standard platforms from a business point of view. But in this case, it&#8217;s plain dangerous as they created a mediocre phone and a mediocre game platform with doing that. Let&#8217;s see how it fares out.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>
