  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> is great, and even greater is how good it gets when you add a few extensions. Here are mine.
&lt;ul&gt;</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;[Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/): While I don't have lots of scripts, things like [Download Video](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/4037) are great. I am looking forward to your suggestions.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;[Better GMail](http://lifehacker.com/software/gmail/lifehacker-code-better-gmail-firefox-extension-251923.php): Ok, this one rocks. You can get saved searches to the left, get attachment icons, conversation view and best of al, macros. I can now navigate my gmail a lot more via the keyboard. Feels like Quicksilver for the Mac. :)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;[Bluedot](http://bluedot.us): I am using Bluedot, and the add-on is obviously a must.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;[CustomizeGoogle](http://www.customizegoogle.com/): This will let you make Google better. Very cool.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;[Firefox Showcase](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/1810): Get an overview of all open windows.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;[Firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/1843): You are doing web development? You need Firebug. Period.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;[GMail Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/1320): Do you have several accounts? One on Google Hosted? Great tool to stay informed without keeping GMail Windows open.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;[Live PageRank](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2007): No need for a Google Toolbar.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;S3 Firefox Organizer and EC2 UI: Working with Amazon S3 or EC2. There you go. Great Tools to have.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
</code></pre>

<p>&lt;/ul&gt;
There you go, those are my additions. Have fun with them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One weekend you relax, and come late to the news, and <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/next-step-in-google-advertising.html">Google has bought Doubleclick</a> for $3.1 billion in cash. Cash. Not stock, cash. Boy oh boy. But it is worth it and I can explain to you why. Some time ago I was sitting in a meeting where we were looking at different banner server companies for use at a big german special interest portal. I was there just to listen in as this might be interesting for another part of the company I was responsible for. We looked at several different ones and at the end Doubleclick won, not because it was better, but because it was the standard, especially in agencies. So there you go. That&#8217;s why it is worth $3.1 billion.</p>

<p>This also becomes clear in the <a href="http://services.google.com/blog_resources/Liberty_FAQ_final_041307.pdf">FAQ</a> that Google put up. They have lots of questions they answer in great detail (especially privacy stuff ;)) and then there is one question they can answer very clearly:</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;Q. Will advertisers and agencies be able to serve ads to Google network sites through DoubleClick?&lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;A. Yes&lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>Ahhhh&#8230; there you go. That&#8217;s the reason they bought Doubleclick. Agencies get X Million USD to manage and distribute and they want to track everything via one tool. Above that, <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2007/04/13/googleclick_and.html">Paul Kedrosky thinks</a> that $1 Billion is really just to be a pain for Microsoft. Above that, this really puts Yahoo! back on the map for lots of people he thinks.</p>

<p>The competition has already cried out and wants regulators to take a close look at the deal as seen <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/16/technology/16soft.html?ex=1334376000&amp;amp;en=e67b8532cbba5ba8&amp;amp;ei=5088&amp;amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;amp;emc=rss">here</a> and <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1024_3-6176180.html">here</a>. I have to admit that the power that is building up there is immense. DoubleClick is amazingly powerful in the agency market and Google has an amazing Network of Sites. The problem is that they will not get the Top of the Fold spots and especially they will not get them as a first solution. They will get the placements that are left over, and their ads will only be shown if there is nothing else the publisher wants to show.</p>

<p>Of course stuff will change a lot on those fronts, but it will take time. With this deal Google has the power to push along integrated changes if the publisher and/or agencies don&#8217;t stop using Doubleclick or AdSense. We&#8217;ll see how it plays out.</p>

<p>Next up, <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2007-04-14-n32.html">Google acquires the Internet</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here in Germany there seems to be a little money day today. First of all, congratulations to the friends from <a href="http://sevenload.de">Sevenload</a> for having closed with <a href="http://www.burdadigital.de/ventures/strategie.html">Burda Digital Ventures</a>.Â  A great partner for Sevenload, and with mother Burda, one that truly works had to understand where the world is going! And as <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=3346">Nico already put it</a>,Â  this means that <a href="http://hebig.com/">Heiko</a> might come by Cologne a bit more often. :) Here is the <a href="http://blog.sevenload.de/2007/03/26/burda-digital-ventures-ist-unser-neuer-starker-partner/">official blog post.</a></p>

<p>It seems that the big media companies really want to make sure that they have their own stakes in the growing video market on the internet. It will be really interesting to see how all of this turn out. The biggest an most interesting thing with all of this is really cost, and I can only suggest reading the last posts from <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/">Cringely</a>. The thing is that each new viewer ads costs, and if you go with a P2P system, there is a lag involved, it only works with highly popular files and the cost is really with the ISP which they will surely not like. Check out <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070315_001831.html">this post</a> by Cringely to see another option: <a href="http://neokast.com/">Neokast</a>. Read the blog :)</p>

<p>Next up is <a href="http://blog.openbc.com/2007/03/econozco_joins_.html">eConozco joins OpenBC</a>. With the acquisition of the leading spanish social network (ok, Orkut seems to be really big in Brazil with like 20 million members, &#8230; no spain, but ok&#8230; never mind) they want to push further into their internationalization.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing is actually Experteer. It all started with me watching the interview with <a href="http://www.gruenderszene.de/?p=101">Martin Weber on GrÃ¼nderszene</a> today. I can only agree with Lukasz that <a href="http://www.holtzbrinck-ventures.com/index.php?de">Holtzbrinck Ventures</a> is one of the best, and/or most active, VCs in Germany at the moment. Truyl a great team. The interesting thing is that in the interview Martin Weber talks about <a href="http://www.experteer.de/">Experteer</a> (min 7:56), which they founded 6 months ago. It&#8217;s fully built on Ruby on Rails it seems (looking forward to seeing another scaling proof) and a little bit different take on the recruitment market. In Experteer you as a user pay to become member, and Headhunters and companies can pitch 60.000 EUR plus jobs to you.Â  Interesting. Even more interesting, now Christian posts that <a href="http://blogging.vc/2007/03/bv-capital-leads-investment-in-german-experteerde">BV Capital and Wellington Partners have invested</a>!</p>

<p>Now I don&#8217;t personally know the team behind Experteer, but with the investor team now behind them, I am looking forward to seeing a good growth curve. :)</p>

<p>So we have Xing buying stuff, Sevenload getting big cash to extend video with Burda, and then the young Experteer getting money from the big guys. This round goes to Experteer I&#8217;d say. Looking forward to what happens next.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been wondering how they do it for some time. The thing is that I can easily use a group of hacked PCs to randomly click ads through a normal IE. I am not really sure how Google would be able to find out which clicking PC is a bot and which is a real person.</p>

<p>There is one other solution though, which seems to gain credibility through <a href="http://www.webbythoughts.com/66/google-adsense-click-reporting-oddity/">this post</a> on Webby Thoughts.</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;It makes me wonder whether Google has algorithms in place to notice when certain posts get traffic spikes and consider a higher percentage of those clicks as invalid clicks. &lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>That is exactly the thing and the only thing how this can work. They will just monitor traffic over the entire network and they for one know that distribution of ads and distribution of content will remain relatively stable, so if something spikes in the distribution curve then they will presume it to be fraud and remove the spike. That seems what has happened in the above case.</p>

<p>This also means that if you suddenly have a short spike in your traffic this will probably not result in too much additional revenue, which will only come if the spike is not a spike but a real continuous growth in traffic.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Actually I should be saying <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a>, because it is really where all this is coming from. It&#8217;s an amazing start-up and the IT team at Ormigo is raving about it. I still do not get to use it because I don&#8217;t really like listening to random music at work. In comes <a href="http://slacker.com/">Slacker</a>. It&#8217;s an amazing start-up with some real talent behind it that kind of makes your last.fm mobile. They are building a portable device, and best of all a <a href="http://www.slacker.com/products.html">car stereo system</a>. That system will use something similar to last.fm. You can say if you like or hate a song, and skip 6 songs per hour and have quasi personal radio through that.</p>

<p>The device will connect to the Slacker network through Satellite and and WiFi whenever a network is available and update the available songs on the internal hard disk. This means you always get fresh songs. Great stuff. I do want that in my car. I&#8217;d need two profiles but still :)</p>

<p>The next step then is that I will have a preferred list of some podcast like some special news, some comedy, and more, and that will be played first. Only then I get some random songs. That would and actually will, totally change your radio listening experience, and the cool thing is &#8230; you will be able to buy the song with the press of a button. Oh the world is interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Deutschland sucht den Superstar, or DSDS in short, is the german equivalent to American Idol. After having been to a full show a few weeks ago, I now attended a final rehearsal. I am obviously biased, because my wife works at Grundy Light Entertainment, who run the show, but it is a cool thing to watch. Especially because seeing it in the studio is very different from TV, which I am not the only one to say. Having played drums and been to a recording studio with my bands twice, hearing the band play is great when listened to live.</p>

<p>&lt;center&gt;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliver/424084042/"> title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/174/424084042_581c01e79a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;17032007(002)&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;</a>&lt;/center&gt;The thing is that I am somebody interested in practically everything. This thirst for information and knowledge is actually what drives me in the direction I am in, culminating in the creation of Ormigo some time ago. The media landscape is an amazing thing, and seeing a little bit behind the curtains of one of the biggest shows in Germany, is really exciting. The amount of people working on this, and their dedication, are something that is truly educating. &lt;center&gt;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliver/424081902/"> title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/182/424081902_9db6ffdaf4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;17032007(001)&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;</a>&lt;/center&gt;In the studio they even have a <a href="http://www.spydercam.com/">Spider Cam</a>, which is great to watch as it zooms through the studio. Really congratulations for the entire team for running a great show.And to those that think I am a freak&#8230; this is entertainment people, and entertainment is there to entertain people and the show really does. People connect to those that are in the last rounds and that is not something that comes from nothing but is hard work. And trying to understand that, and letting yourself be entertained, is truly interesting.</p>

<p>This is really big, really expensive, and really profitable. Amazing. Especially for somebody having founded a company.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At least <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/003441.php">John thinks they should</a>.</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;It seems that currently both still have a tough time, even though <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2006/12/29/panama-to-the-rescue/">Panama seems encouraging</a>. And there are a lot of players out there that make things more interesting, like the efforts of <a href="http://wunderloop.com">wunderloop</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So John suggests for them to join forces instead of trying to kill each other in the race to catch Google. They should form a new company, name Soverture ;), throw in their search monetization and syndication plays and recruit together. They can also build a killer AdSense product he believes. All in all a good idea but not thought far enough.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are too many players out there already and for the portals, those with the best deal should win. What we need is an open market place where everyone can be plugged in. We need to be able to allow a publisher to handle ads themselves, but have a backfill from different other providers that fit best. The publisher then has to be able to decide how much share of their revenue they want to spend on optimization, taking somebody out there that does content match well, or adding somebody for demographic targeting or social targeting. We have to stop this being a walled garden, a blackbox from all sides where everybody believes they will only win if they will not tell anyone how it works. THAT will be interesting and I propose a similar corporate structure like VISA.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
