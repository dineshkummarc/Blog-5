  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Here a quote from The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran about Children:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Your children are not your children.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;They are the sons and daughters of Life&#8217;s longing for itself.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;They come through you but not from you, and though they are with you yet they belong not to you.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You may give them your love but not your thoughts, for they have their own thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You may house their bodies but not their souls, for their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and he bends you with his might that his arrows may go swift and far.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Let your bending in the archer&#8217;s hand be for gladness; For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so he loves the bow that is stable.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>We need to move all e-mail and www to another server. Ship the mail and web server to a new location and then sell the other two servers and move all of their stuff to the new server. Wonderful. The party is starting.</p>

<p>Sendmail sucks (dmail rules! :)) and I need to set up sendmail to take over mail for a few days from the mail server. Grrr&#8230;. this will be  fun. Somebody remind me why I am doing an MBA?!?!? :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A lot of things happened in the last few days and most of them were really fun :)</p>

<p>First of all I started doing <a href="http://www.taebo.com/">Tae-Bo</a>, full body workout (as they put it) through a mix of kickboxing and fitness moves, via their instruction DVD. I really suggest everyone looking into this. It is a really fun way to get a bit more fit. I mean you really have fun doing it and I went a lot further in terms of effort with this than with other methods. I mean you have to do some work obviously to get an effect but I really see this working. The main problem at the start is that you have a hard time keeping up with some things, but if you do it with some friends together then you will have a great laugh. I mean you are doing some punch, punch,  punch, kick series in slow motion and then the instructor says to speed it up and at first you are totally lost. I still have no idea how they do it in the fast version. I cannot even move my limbs that fast :) But I see myself getting there. Enough talking. Try it out or just ask something. It is hard to explain it really.</p>

<p>Of course other things happened too. I am really starting to dig php and scripting. It is getting more fun each day. I have now edited my <a href="http://thylmann.com/oliver/">homepage</a> to be total php and I really dig creating only one main file and including some others depending on variables. I might totally remove that though once it looses it&#8217;s coolness factor. I am not yet sure if it is better to create one file and include others or create the content files and include the formating files. Hmmm&#8230; live is hard once you get to use its potential :)</p>

<p>We also moved our counter site lists to php now, which you can see at <a href="http://www.counted.com/">Counted!</a>. It really rocks. And to add on that my brother just moved Counted! to the new statistics system and now we have a lot more added features in there. You have a total multi page statistics, a really advanced referrer system (which tells you if the people that come are new or old visitors from every url) and a lot more nice things. I still need to write the news items for the counters to tell people about it.</p>

<p>Grrr&#8230; we still need a mailing system to mail all webmasters though. Damn. You always need things don&#8217;t you?</p>

<p>Next to that we are close to getting our new server. We are moving hosting to <a href="http://www.likewhoa.com/">Like Whoa</a> (cool name eh? :)) who are great and are buying a new server for that. We actually decided on a Dell server now. IBM is just too damn slow. Actually we are not even dealing with IBM anymore who said that they are not selling servers (yeah right, that&#8217;s why it took them 3 days to say that) and referred us to econocom. Those are nice people but also rather slow. Especially compared to Dell. So Dell got the cut.</p>

<p>Just one problem with all of them is that we need to buy the server in Belgium, get it delivered in Belgium and then we need to ship it to the New York. So much for global corporations.</p>

<p>Oh. I am currently at Deutsche Bank 24, and my brokerage account is Brokerage 24. Good. Now they changed everything, actually for the 1st of next month. To MaxBlue. Woohooo. And I will have no fees for my brokerage account. Well not exactly. If I buy  something then I will have fees and those have just risen 33%. Aha! Well it is flat fee. Which is good if you buy stocks in 10000 EUR chunks but that is not really what I am doing (yet ;)) so it is rather bad for me. I think I need to talk to them.</p>

<p>Another tip. Always talk to companies before you cancel an account. Mobile phone providers will give you kick ass deals if you do that :)</p>

<p>Back to doing stuff. So many company ideas in my head it is sickening. I would like to form 3 other companies from the top of my head. Grrr&#8230; Oh did I tell you I need beaming?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just read an article on fastcompany.com about a very cool e-mail. Seems like the statistics represented in there are roughly correct. Very insightful.</p>

<p>If we could shrink the earth&#8217;s population to a village of precisely 100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same, it would look something like the following. There would be:</p>

<p>57 Asians
21 Europeans; 14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
8 Africans
52 would be female
48 would be male
70 would be non-white
30 would be white
70 would be non-Christian
30 would be Christian
89 would be heterosexual
11 would be homosexual
6 people would possess 59% of the entire world&#8217;s wealth and all 6 would be from the United States.
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
1 ( yes, only 1 ) would have a college education
1 would own a computer</p>

<p>When one considers our world from such a compressed perspective, the need for both acceptance, understanding and education becomes glaringly apparent.</p>

<p>Something to think about.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ahhh&#8230; I finally found a picture that is not 3 years old. This one is from 2 articles I have written for clickz.com. They can be found <a href="http://clickz.com/article/cz.2204.html">here</a> and <a href="http://clickz.com/article/cz.2233.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I actually went further with scripting which is really  cool. I now have a backup happeneing and mails sent to be once a day to tell me how big the directory is and how much space is left on the drive.</p>

<p>The one I just wrote will send me an sms message when the database crashes and I need to take a backup and copy that over. Doing that automatically is a bit too risky in my mind until I see that the system is fully working. I am not sure yet, the if statement is kind of a hack :)</p>

<p>Next thing will be a password protected wap page that will let me perform the required operations to get the database back online :)</p>

<p>This is fun. And I just started converting my homepage, which barely exists, so it is a good time, to php. Learning php is fun I have to say. Once all our domains are updated then I will go working some more with MySQL too. Woohooo&#8230; turning coder again on my old age :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow. My mother just called. Did I ever tell you that my parents are going nuts on their old age? ;)</p>

<p>They just called to tell me that they rented a place on the cost of Belgium (my parents live in Brussels) for several months this summer starting May. Right at the sea front next to the beach. It rocks! I really don&#8217;t know what went into them, but quite frankly I do not really care ;)</p>

<p>This place is just 2 hours or so by car from where I am (Aachen/Germany) and this means that I will be able to have a few days of relaxing from time to time at the cost in belgium. It is even big enough to bring some friends (some, not many ;)).</p>

<p>I really have to be very thankful to be blessed with so wonderful parents. And no this is not just because they just rented the place. I have so much to thank them for it is amazing and I will try my best to pay them back to the best of my abilitiy.</p>

<p>To quote the Dalai Lama: Live a good, honorable life. Then, when you get older and think back, you&#8217;ll be able to enjoy it a second time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok. I know the US holds their right to carry guns high but come on!!! How does an 8 year old get his hands on a gun??????</p>

<p><a href="http://dailynews.philly.com/content/daily_news/2001/03/06/local/GUNN06.htm">Here</a> is a story about an 8 year old, 3rd grader!!!, that threatened a 9 year old girl with the gun. In January a 10 year old student was arrested with an 9mm pistol in his hand bag. In a report from 1998-99 they found 39 fireamrs, 457 knives and 449 other weapons. Damn!</p>

<p>Come people, think! I know we have knives in school here too (Germany) but there is one simple thing you can do. Get those damn guns of the street. Yeah yeah, they will always find a gun if they really want to. But they will not find it in some drawer at home! And no, tighter laws on where to keep the guns is not an option.</p>

<p>I really do not get it why people still need to be able to have a gun at home. It&#8217;s not as if 70000000 people die here each day because some nut comes into their appartment and their only option would  have been to kill that person with their own gun. I actually feel quite safe here in germany.</p>

<p>And another thing. What does the world expect happens. I am a small school kid (no I am not, I am just making the assumption :)) with not enough attention. Now what do  I see on TV? These kids with 100000 cameras in their face and articles all over the news that killed somebody in school. I desperately want attention. I need attention. I want to be noticed. I can find a gun easily. If I am neglected and see no other way then I would also go into a school with a gun and start threatening people. I doubt I would shoot, I mean I just can&#8217;t imaging what these kids are thinking, but I can see that they might just see no other way at the time then to prove their point.</p>

<p>Hmmm&#8230; back to work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Woohooo&#8230; good night. I just started with scripting a bit again. This is something I started doing reading the <a href="http://www.beosbible.com/">BeOS Bible</a> from Scot Hacker and especially the Scripting part from Chris Herborth. Scot did an amazing work with that book and Chris&#8217; Scripting part is just amazing I think. Especially if you want to start learning scripting. It is very basic at the start and get&#8217;s into scripting in BeOS at the end. Very cool stuff.</p>

<p>Actually now I did a backup script on a FreeBSD box and also another one that sends me an e-mail daily about the free space on the hard disk. Not too fancy but really a cool thing if you just did very little scripting up till now and also did not do this for some time.</p>

<p>One of the great learning experiences for me was, among others, trying to alter Scot Hacker&#8217;s <a href="http://www.betips.net/TrackerBase/">TrackerBase</a> script which runs <a href="http://www.betips.net/">BeTips</a>.</p>

<p>Enough praising Scot now though :)</p>

<p>I really hate looking at the laptop running Windows as I write this on the desktop in BeOS. Grrr&#8230; Somebody code a driver for Lucent&#8217;s WaveLAN cards for BeOS! :)</p>

<p>Ok, it is after 3am, I might be a bit confused in my head. Especially after I was taken out for dinner today to a Thai restaurant and choose to eat something spicy. I actually like spicy. Really. But boy was this spicy. They had something like 6 different degrees of spicy and my brother told me that 4 would be ok as 3 is really still ok for him. I generally eat more spicy then he does. Ah well. I took 4 and I will not do it again. I mean it was <em>very</em> good, but I am only now starting to regain feeling in my tongue. :)</p>

<p>I really have to go there again. There are so many things I would still like to eat so many things, do so many things, see so many things, feel so many things, &#8230; live is good today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Actually this is a very cool game I have to say. I am part of a group beta testing a server based system and started playing today. Got of to a good start winning and then my third game (first crashed) stopped mid way. This was very challenging.</p>

<p>I will try to play this guy again, as he really seems to know what he is doing and I am looking forward to learning more about this. It is really challenging on the head and a good way to relax.</p>

<p>This is also something I was told some time ago driving from the Netherlands back to Aachen with a friend. Chess seems to be something that is used for relaxation by incubators for coders. Mostly because you need to concentrate and that gets your mind of the coding part a bit.</p>

<p>The last game was especially challenging because an advance was started on me really fast and I was mostly reacting, trying to get out of my seemingly bad position. Later I was told that my position wasn&#8217;t so bad after all :)</p>

<p>One complaint though. Ok. We have a castle/tower. In German it is called Turm aka Tower. In english they called it rook. WHY?!?!?! It is a god damn tower. Why do they need to give it other names? To confuse me? Grrr&#8230; :)</p>

<p>( that mood list is too long ;))</p>
