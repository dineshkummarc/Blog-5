  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>Groups are very powerful and you on one hand have to abide by the rules of the group and on the other hand benefits are to be gained from group membership. The idea is that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Also, people gain satisfactions, establish or confirm an identity, gain help and support, share and help in a common activity</p>

<p>Kakbadse et al. (1988) identified 4 groups.</p>

<p>Formal Groups may be departments or project teams, at least they have some formal recognition and authority.
Informal Groups might be groups of common interest, a group of friends or a network of black managers.
Primary Groups are with regular and frequent interactions and they usually have an important influence on their membersâ€™ values, attitudes and beliefs.
Secondary Groups are often larger and less cohesive.</p>

<p>There are several organisational uses of formal groups like distributing and managing work, problem solving and decision making, passing on information, co-ordination and liasing, â€¦</p>

<p>You should try to have multicultural groups which results in not having an agreed social way of behaving. This should be remembered.</p>

<p>In virtual groups interactions are hard to manage due to lack of immediacy of face-to-face meetings.</p>

<p>Factors affecting Groups</p>

<p>The group size is important and a bigger group brings more skills, knowledge but also less influence for their members. It has been shown that 5-7 members is best and a group of 10-12 should be split up to sub groups.</p>

<p>The nature of the task needs to be realistic and important to the group for it to be effective. It should also have the right degree of challenge. You should pay attention that the tasks are split up and the group does not need to perform two tasks at the same time.</p>

<p>Resources and support are needed in adequate amounts.</p>

<p>External recognition is important for members to feel that the work of their group is accepted as being important to the organisation ï¿½ motivation.</p>

<p>Group composition has to take into account the necessary competences to tackle the groupâ€™s task. But remember that a homogeneous group will have high satisfaction, less conflict and also less creativity while a heterogeneous group will have the exact opposite with the added bonus that the outcome will be more widely accepted.</p>

<p>When you contribute to a groupâ€™s discussion, it is important to attend to both the completion of the task and to the maintenance of the group.</p>

<p>Task oriented
- Proposing (â€¦ideas of courses of action)
- Building (â€¦adding to proposals)
- Disagreeing
- Giving and seeking info
- Summarising</p>

<p>Maintenance oriented
- Gate-keeping
- Encouraging
- Resolving conflict
- Giving feedback
- Recognising feelings</p>

<p>Sometimes it is difficult to see whether a particular action is maintenance-oriented or self-oriented (to satisfy personal needs).</p>

<p>There are several self oriented behaviours as of Kakabadse:
-   Attacking/defending
-   Blocking/stating difficulties
-   Diverting
-   Seeking sympathy/recognition
-   Withdrawing
-   Point-scoring
-   Over-contributing
-   Trivialising/diluting</p>

<p>Here are some common problems in groups. One of them are hidden agendas, which should be brought out into the open, and blind spots, which occur when some people know something about somebody else that the individual does not know. One of the main reasons is that people do not want to hurt others. Again, they should be (sensibly) brought out into the open.</p>

<p>Group anxiety come from stress, which grows with the size of the group. There are then fewer opportunities for immediate confirmation or feedback and you tend to fantasise about what other people think or intend. This will be dealt with as a group or on an individual level. You need to deal with this in a way that is felt to be constructive and mutually acceptable.</p>

<p>Groupthink is when, after some time and forgetting the reason, there is a sense of â€˜thatâ€™s the way to do itâ€™. Janis (1972) suggested that under certain conditions commitment to the group overrides the ability to assess situations realistically. This might be:
-   time pressure
-   cohesive group
-   isolated group
-   leader has a preferred solution</p>

<p>these are the symptoms:
-   exaggerated sense of importance of the group.
-   Unanimity
-   Rationalising away the less-preferred options
-   Appeals to morality
-   Negative stereotyping
-   Members should conform
-   Self-censorship on doubt</p>

<p>To work against groupthink try to keep up a diversity of opinion, try to aim at a moderate consensus in the group and possibly make somebody the devilâ€™s advocate or invite new members with different ideas.</p>

<p>You also need to structure group involvement and there are three systems for this.</p>

<p>With Round robins everyone in the group has an equal chance and you are focussing attention on the ideas rather than on who suggested them.
Problem -&gt; Thinking -&gt; In turn share ideas -&gt; write down -&gt; done</p>

<p>Brainstorming works in such a way that only after the group has exhausted all its ideas is evaluation carried out.</p>

<p>If you have a large group then it might be an idea to split the group up into several, smaller, buzz groups of two to five people to discuss issues in depth. A wider range of approaches to a problem may emerge than would have come from one larger group.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<ol>
<li>What does the person in the job need to be effective?</li>
<li>How is the job holder performing in relation to what is required?</li>
<li>How might the job holder develop in relation to what is required?</li>
</ol>


<p>For accessing performance standards need to be set and clarification reached:</p>

<ul>
<li>Terms and conditions and meeting contractual obligations
o   Hours of attendance
o   Procedures
o   Adherence to rules</li>
<li>Quality of work
o   Standard of written work
o   Appearance of finished items of work
o   Acceptable error rates</li>
<li>Work output and timing
o   Quantity of finished items of work
o   Production norms
o   Deadlines and timescales</li>
<li>Interpersonal behaviour and dealing with others
o   Standards of behaviour with clients
o   Appropriate behaving to colleagues</li>
</ul>


<p>Objective quantitative standards may involve numerical targets, timescales and deadlines, amounts, costs and resource usage. Non-numerical need certain verifiable descriptive statement were fulfilled. Many apparently objective measures are, in reality, quite subjective.</p>

<p>Subjective qualitative standards are needed most times. When assessing people subjectively social influence and personal preferences can come into play. You will find assessing performance easier if, at the outset, you communicate them to people and obtain their agreement and understanding.</p>

<p>Methods of assessing performance:
-   Observation and involvement
-   Questioning and discussion
-   Routine statistics and reporting
-   Own statistics
-   Other reports (regular, complaints or queries, exception reports)</p>

<p>Ask yourself weather you need extensive factual information and to increase your objectivity, the information collected should be relevant and related to an agreed standard of performance.</p>

<p>You then have to interpret the information and make a choice of:
-   continuing without change if e.g.: disparity not serious, correction would risk making things worse, not reasons for failure found, afraid of conflict.
-   Correcting performance: commit additional resources, resolve difficulties, changing procedures, training, â€¦ this might be because standards are not understood, ignored or deliberately worked against.
-   Revising the standards: changed circumstances render them unrealistic, but consider weather more problems by changing them.</p>

<p>If you need to deal with underperformers, then Armstrong (1995) has a list:
-   identify and agree on the problem
-   establish the reason(s) for the shortfall. Is the problem one of support, understanding, ability, skill or attitude?
-   Decide and agree on the action required: developing skills, providing more guidance
-   Resource the action: coaching, training
-   Monitor and provide feedback</p>

<p>You should also be giving and receiving feedback and working for a boss who doesnâ€™t care about staff is very demotivating. Well-designed jobs will allow for intrinsic feedback so that individuals can monitor and adjust their own performance. Feedback is not one-way: you will rarely have all the necessary information you need without discussing matters with staff.</p>

<p>When giving feedback, keep the following three Rs in mind:
-   Relevant
-   Right (thoughtful and logical, evidence)
-   Rapid (related to current work)</p>

<p>It should go beyond giving praise and praise should be clarified.</p>

<p>The performance appraisal is very important, normally in the form of an interview scheduled once or twice a year. There are benefits for the individual (encourage, recognition, review, new measures, career aspiration, better communication), the manager (motivate staff, reinforce goals, learn more about concerns, new course of action, improving efficiency) and the organisation (succession planning, workforce planning, ensure objectives are agreed on, improve communication, improve performance)</p>

<p>Many negative experiences of appraisal result from the lack of preparation and both the appraiser and appraisee should receive training.</p>

<p>When conducting an appraisal interview some organisations choose a 360-degree appraisal, which involves getting feedback from all aspects of an individualâ€™s performance from a variety of people, including the employeeâ€™s customers in the organisation or those whom their work affects.</p>

<p>A few guidelines should be.</p>

<p>Preparation
Give advance notice and possibly use an appraisal form which can then be used as the framework.</p>

<p>Meeting and agenda
Encourage the appraisee to talk and check your understanding and use open-ended questions.</p>

<p>Atmosphere
Avoid interruptions.</p>

<p>Evaluating the appraisal
Both need to agree objectives for the period between this and the next appraisal. Many organisations find it better for all parties if appraisal is not used in connecting with staff grading and remuneration. An appraisal should be carried out by someone who is familiar with the work of the employee.</p>

<p>There might be some problems with appraisal interviews though, which could include that the aims and benefits are not properly understood, actions agreed are not followed through, process is hurried and little significance attached to it, relationship between parties is poor, appraisee unable to discuss issues.</p>

<p>The pitfalls to avoid are:
-   Comparing an individual with other members of staff.
-   The â€˜not like meâ€™ syndrome.
-   Giving the benefit of the doubt. (never do this)
-   The history of the good or bad performer.
-   Demanding excessive evidence
-   Crediting â€˜niceâ€™ people</p>

<p>When dealing with individual development needs the organisation as a whole has a responsibility to develop policies and provide resources.  The manager also has part of the responsibility as you know the personâ€™s work, previous experience and aspiration. The individual has their own stake in their own future.</p>

<p>In many cases the manager is the role model, which means you have to take it serious or your staff will not either. And remember to mix both on the job and off the job learning.
And you need to make sure that after courses the staff has â€˜protected timeâ€™ to go over and practise what they have been taught.</p>

<p>You will notice development need through a mix of working together, formal and informal discussions and you should be continuously think about it as the purpose is to raise the skill level and standards within you team.</p>

<p>Remember that the abilities, experience and aspiration of the individual should fall nicely together with the demands and possibilities of the job as well as the prospects and future needs of the organisationâ€™s emerging priorities.</p>

<p>But development is not always the answer as the work might be too difficult or constant friction exists between two teams, â€¦ training and development cannot make people into something they are not.</p>

<p>You should also be thinking about coaching and mentoring.</p>

<p>Coaching is about giving them insights into new techniques or ways of working and generally helping them to understand and develop their abilities, and learn from their mistakes.</p>

<p>The fundamental difference with mentoring is that it should not be done by the employeeâ€™s line manager. Often older, or at least considerably more experienced people are mentoring.  They assist the development, can identify the strengths and weaknesses  and have the personal skills to build a relationship.</p>

<p>Clutterbuck (1991) suggests that there is a 4 way relationship between the Mentor, Line Manager, Protï¿½gï¿½ and the Trainer, who monitors the relationship and looks at resources for training.</p>

<p>Mentoring is more of a private option thing.</p>

<p>Remember that the balance between the needs of the individual, the job and the organisation is central to staff development.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>The benefits of supervision are the achievement of co-ordination and control. Individuals need someone to take an interest in their work, and to have access to the decision makers and resource allocators. Supervision is good communication.</p>

<p>Core functions:
-   supporting individuals and making sure they are adequately resourced and fairly treated
-   Enabling them to have some influence over their work
-   Seeing that they fulfil the organisationâ€™s objectives as well as their own
-   Ensuring that what is agreed is done</p>

<p>Supervision is partly controlling and directive as well as supportive.</p>

<p>Task-related activities:
-   shaping
-   target setting
-   explaining
-   delegating
-   guiding
-   limiting
-   negotiating
-   resourcing</p>

<p>People-related activities:
-   coaching
-   encouraging
-   facilitating
-   counselling
-   rewarding
-   representing
-   evaluating</p>

<p>The following factors may affect supervision:
-   personal style
-   the nature of the task
-   the ability and experience of the individuals involved
-   the nature of the psychological contract
-   the degree of authority
-   physical distance or proximity</p>

<p>Remember that all individuals are entitled to be treated fairly and to receive the same standard of supervision. The most valuable skill is to be able to adapt to what is needed.</p>

<p>For a relationship to be successful it needs to be founded on trust and responsibility. Remember to pay attention both to the task and the person.</p>

<p>A supervision session can be formal or informal and the underlying aims are to:
-   build up trust
-   allow space for joint negotiation
-   enable feedback
-   make clear what are the joint responsibilities
-   enable the function of control and support</p>

<p>It is best to find a private place where you and the other person can speak freely and without interruptions.</p>

<p>When you begin, agree on a shared agenda. The main purpose should be to review what has happened since the last one. Achieve this understanding and then decide what needs to happen. You should also partrol the boundaries, provide information (changes, developments, â€¦), protect and challenge/develop the individual.</p>

<p>Your ultimate aim should be to enable individuals to become relatively independent and self-supervising. This means encouraging:
-   self-reflection and analysis
-   awareness of problems or benefits
-   appreciation of the next set of priorities</p>

<p>At the end, tie up and loose ends and make notes of what has been agreed.</p>

<p>There are some common problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jobs change</li>
<li>Work seems simple</li>
<li>Not informed</li>
<li>No relation to work</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is a checklist for a supervision session:
-   arrange for a mutual convenient time
-   review the work
-   report on any developments
-   record the outcomes and agree new targets</p>

<p>Another approach is management by objectives (MBO) where managers provide staff with tasks and assignments which have targets of objectives to be reached. Employeeâ€™s accomplishments are measured by what they achieve, not by who they are or by their ability to carry out instructions.</p>

<p>MBA relies on objectives or targets being:
-   challenging
-   attainable
-   subject to measurement
-   relevant</p>

<p>Objectives should be discussed and agreed, and action plans formulated so that it is clear how they are to be carried out.</p>

<p>A potential problem is that objectives may be set too high or low, affecting the moral, employees may feel guilty if they fail to reach targets.</p>

<p>AT a simple level MBO can form a framework for supervision in the pursuit of agreed goals; carried further, it can be the basis of an organisationâ€™s way of working.</p>

<p>Supervision is also about delegation. When you delegate a task you do not stop being responsible for what happens, but for delegation to be effective you must give authority for someone else to carry out the task. There are different ways to delegate.</p>

<ul>
<li>Leave the person alone</li>
<li>Stand beside him , stopping his worst mistake</li>
<li>Give detailed instruction and then leave alone</li>
</ul>


<p>The following factors should influence your decision:
-   The quality of the result
-   The ability of the individual
-   Your relationship
-   Time</p>

<p>You can regulate a little bit by:
-   definition of the task and outputs to be achieved
-   degree of discretion over how the task is done
-   form of control</p>

<p>The two underlying themes of delegation are trust and control.</p>

<p>There are some pitfalls and difficulties, among others if you are self-managed.</p>

<p>Excessive supervision happens when the supervisor still wants to be directly involved, is anxious about the individualâ€™s abilities, fails to see the different between helping and expecting them to do it.
Infrequent supervision because of lack of time.
Inadequate supervision happens because the supervisor wants to avoid facing up to difficulties or complexity or because of major differences in the life experiences of the individual and the supervisor.
Progressive overloading happens when you delegate too much.
Inconsistent behaviour in supervision happens for example when the supervisor is a boss one minute and a colleague the next.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>How to integrate a new member of staff into the organisation.</p>

<p>There are 9 stages but the first 5 were covered with the recruitment and selection. We will not look at Adjustment, Adaptation, Attrition and Audit.</p>

<p>Induction is the tangible part of the organisational entry while socialisations my be described as the intangible, familiarising the newcomer with the often unwritten and unstated ways of working and communicating within an organisation.</p>

<p>Dessler (1988) identifies some of the problems of the initial entry stage for the newcomer as being due to the following factors:
-   Change
-   Unrealistic expectations
-   Surprise</p>

<p>To find the information and support you should provide Fowler (1996) suggested several levels:
-   Individual level: contractual issues, personal support.
-   Job / task level: work to be done, how to start; health and safety drills, rules, procedures, â€¦
-   Support and department level: relationships to employees, other jobs, other departments; meeting key contacts, â€¦
-   Organisational level: structure, objectives, wider context; policies, pension and insurance schemes, â€¦</p>

<p>The induction has 3 aspaces as of Marchington and Wilkinson, 1996:
-   An administrative exercise: info aobut job, procedures, orga
-   Welfare and employee support process: well-being, support provided as needed
-   Human resources management process: educate people about company ethos, their individ. Accountabilities and standards of performance required.</p>

<p>Remember that special groups might need special care.</p>

<p>Go slowly with the induction and here are some aspects that you might need:
-   Documentation
-   A buddy
-   Meet colleagues
-   Special projects
-   Useful task for the first day</p>

<p>It is also useful if several people start at the same time.</p>

<p>Other factors might have an effect:
-   Degree of formality
-   Individual or group induction
-   Organisational fit
-   Resources available</p>

<p>Socialisation is a four-stage process, as of Wanous (1992) :
-   Confronting and accepting reality
-   Achieving role clarity
-   Coming to terms with the context
-   Detecting signposts of successful socialisation</p>

<p>Harris and DeSimone put forward three fundamental concepts relating to socialisation:
-   Organisational roles influence how a person fits into the organisation, help them make sense of their own position, and begin to define what they must do to perform effectively.
-   Group norms need to be understood and people need to com to terms with the ways of working, rules and established patterns of behaviour. There is no universal model that the newcomer can use to help them understand the norms of the group they are joining
-   The individualâ€™s and organisationâ€™s expectations are a key aspect of induction and socialisation.</p>

<p>As of Meighan (1991) there are different roles in an organisation that have a role in the induction:
-   Human resources department
-   Managers and supervisors
-   Colleagues and other staff
-   Training staff
-   Existing staff</p>

<p>In general you have the organisation take over the formal part and possibly the person leaving the job giving over some of the knowledge and existing stuff for social support and the wider picture. The manager will do the induction, show the tasks and do the monitoring, etc.</p>

<p>The key to successful recruitment is to ensure that the criteria of suitability are overt and relevant to the job itself. =&gt; Rational decision</p>

<p>Qualities of the applicant need to match organisation requirements</p>

<p>Recruiter perception will by influenced by the halo effect (similarities to yourself). Pay attention to keep your prejudice and preferences out of it.</p>

<p>The person-job fit should be concerned with accessing and measuring personal factors which can be compared to those required for the job.</p>

<p>The person-organisation fit accesses how suited the applicant is to the organisation â€“ its style, approach, pace of change and informal ways of working, â€¦ the culture of the organisation.</p>

<ol>
<li>Specifying job and person requirements</li>
</ol>


<p>You need to look at:</p>

<ul>
<li>Job analysis
i.  Discuss with the current holder, supervisor
ii. Build a checklist</li>
<li>What, when where how are things done.</li>
<li>What responsibilities.</li>
<li>What relationships?</li>
<li>What requirements?</li>
<li>What working conditions?</li>
<li>Who needs to be consulted?</li>
<li>Organisational analysis</li>
<li>Job description
i.  Summary of main responsibilities and activities
ii. Specific responsibilities</li>
<li>staff</li>
<li>assets</li>
<li>planning</li>
<li>technical decisions</li>
<li>financial</li>
<li>confidential info</li>
<li>degree of supervision</li>
<li>contacts</li>
<li>working conditions</li>
<li>organisational</li>
</ul>


<p>All in all the job description has various uses including review of staff performance, assessing training needs and it leads to the next stageâ€¦.</p>

<ul>
<li>Person specification</li>
</ul>


<p>Here you need to be as precise as possible. Specific what is essential as well as what is desirable.</p>

<p>Next you need to look at recruiting and selecting internal candidates who should receive the same treatment as all other candidates.</p>

<p>Next you need to find sources of recruits which is a lot of things. Advertising is one of them but you need to be sure where to advertise and that you get the most effective response for your money. You can take the information for this from the job analysis and job description.</p>

<p>Fields should be title, organisation name, nature of activity and location, aims and responsibilities of the job, qualifications and experience needed, salary and fringe benefits, promotion prospects, how to apply, closing date.</p>

<p>Also make sure that application forms are there and that everything is in place for dealing with paperwork. You need to keep detailed records at every stage.</p>

<p>Next you need to shortlist your replies. 6 per position is common. You can then see where people meet the minimum and where the desirable option.</p>

<p>References need to be checked but pay attention that you are allowed to.</p>

<p>You need to treat candidates as sensitive and responsive human beings and they make decisions too.</p>

<ol>
<li>Methods of selection</li>
</ol>


<p>Interviews are useful for assessing such things as practical intelligence and interpersonal and comm.. skills.</p>

<p>Tests can actually replicate parts of the job but they are time-consuming.</p>

<p>The selection interview shows if the candidate is interested and competent. An interview needs to be well planned (What does the interviewer need, candidate need, location requirements, â€¦)</p>

<p>Requirements for a good interview:
-   could do the job
-   would do the job
-   would fit
-   a clear idea of questions
-   agreement of the roles in the interview
-   disciplined approach to timing</p>

<p>An interview should be split up in an introduction and the main body in which 70% of the time the candidate should be talking.</p>

<p>There are some essential skills:
-   Effective questioning
o   when you can zoom in do so. Probe.
o   Frame your questions to suit your purpose
o   Use questions about specific incidents in the past
o   Questions should elicit info that is relevant
o   Not random but comprehensive and grouped
o   Similar areas for all candidates
o   Allow you to compare candidates
-   Controlling the flow of the interview
o   The ability to keep a candidate talking about the things you need to know
-   Using listening skills
-   Evaluating the information
-   Drawing the interview to a close, then -&gt;
o   Invite c. to talk about anything that has not been covered
o   Let c. ask questions about job or the terms and conditions associated
-   Reaching a final decision
o   Pull together notes and impressions
o   The selection process will be the objective one but intuition should not be ignored</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>You are in a position to influence motivation of people. To look at your own motivation one should look back at particular events in the past that stand out in memory ( critical incident analysis ).</p>

<p>In the 1920s there were the Hawthorne Studies (often associated with Elton Mayo) which went into the social needs model. Their main findings were that basic social needs can be met through work and that people respond more to pressure in their own social group. This resulted in the understanding that managers need to help employees to meet their social needs.</p>

<p>This theory was further developed in 1954 by Maslow in the hierarchy of needs which were simplified by Huczynski and Buchanan in 1991.</p>

<ul>
<li>Physical Needs: working conditions, wage, housing, catering,â€¦</li>
<li>Safety: health insurance, pension provision, safety, security in job</li>
<li>Social: sports, clubs, parties, outings, open communications, â€¦</li>
<li>Esteem: Regular positive feedback, prestigious job titles, promotions</li>
<li>Self-actualisation: challenging, encouraging, can structure own work</li>
</ul>


<p>Problems are said to be that our priorities change depending on our stage in life and it was more focussed on (male) Western society.</p>

<p>Another theory comes from Herzberg et al which said that improvement in some areas remove dissatisfaction ( hygiene factors ) and some can prove to be satisfying ( motivation factors ).</p>

<p>Analogy: Good hygiene can prevent you from becoming ill but will not normally improve your health.</p>

<p>Important points:
-   responsibility grows satisfactions
-   effective policies, procedures, environment and good pay can reduce dissatisfaction</p>

<p>The problem here is that again people change over time and you do not understand the link between people and their satisfaction.</p>

<p>Expectancy theory stresses that it is not just having a reward or incentive that is important but rather the link between effort and reward. The link needs to be clear.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>The early example of job design is scientific management. In the 1960s and 70s reformers wanted to redesign work around more human principles and a number of programmes emerges focussed on the â€˜quality of working lifeâ€™.</p>

<p>Job design means that your job consists of several quantifiable characteristics which , added together, represent what you do on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p>You should review jobs periodically and proactive to see how they develop.</p>

<p>A job is made up of several parts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to look at this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-  When you understand why a person acting in a certain way, then you can better predict what they will do next.&lt;br /&gt;
-   To understand behaviour you need to understand the underlying social pressures.&lt;br /&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;br /&gt;
The individual is in charge of what they do and what it means. â€œHumans are pro-active rather than reactive.â€? (Huczynski and Buchanan, 1991)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that events do not have one fixed meaning, but a number of different interpretations. This is why Eden starting using mental models in 1988.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we think someone is arrogant before a meeting, this will shape how we interpret what he or she does. -&gt; a vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behaviour shapes thinking which shapes interpretation of behaviour. In the end this means that people construct events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly said in 1991 that these constructs actually say nothing about that person but everything about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These mental models have a structure, aka, there are higher and lower values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-  individual values&lt;br /&gt;
-   professional or occupational values (code of ethics, value statement)&lt;br /&gt;
-   group / team values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshalling people, often with very disparate agendas to work towards the overarching goals of the organisation, is at the heard of the managers role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to values we are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-  aiming at achieving goals â€“ goal directed and purposeful&lt;br /&gt;
-   or (as is the purpose of a goal) need driven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huczynski and Buchanan also said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   â€œOur society or our culture influences our motives through the values, ideals, standards are modes of behaviour of other people.â€?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ï¿½ Behaviour might be seen as a reflection of a role that generates a set of expectations that we try to conform to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, what is â€œappropriateâ€? is out of our control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is partly right as regulating our behaviour is not only expected, it is absolutely necessary for life to run smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common mistakes that people do are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-  only consider objective facts&lt;br /&gt;
-   everyone works for the same goals / values&lt;br /&gt;
-   some behaviour does not make sense and can therefore be discounted
&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;You need to transmit a message in a form that assures the recipients understand what it means and is not open to different interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On occasions, what people do not say is as important as what they do say and sometimes we communicate more by the way in which something is said.&lt;br /&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;br /&gt;
Language Terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-  locution: the set of words arranged in some order. E.g.: â€œthis is a long meeting.&lt;br /&gt;
-   Illocution: can be hidden within the literal meaning of the words. E.g.: â€œTom is very thoroughâ€? might mean â€œTim is very slow, I would have finished this hours ago.â€?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deaux et al. (1993) said that we use words for five things :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-  describe something&lt;br /&gt;
-   trying to influence someone&lt;br /&gt;
-   expressing feelings or attitudes&lt;br /&gt;
-   making a commitment&lt;br /&gt;
-   trying to accomplish something directly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language Terms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-  meta language: words take on a specific but non-literal meaning&lt;br /&gt;
-   para language: how something is said (pitch, rhythm, intensity, pauses, non-verbal vocalisation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extend to which people can control and interpret non-verbal behaviour undoubtedly influences their success in communication. Things you need to control would include: body posture, waving, facial expression, eye contact â€“ gaze, body contact, orientation, personal space, â€¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic communication develops its own jargon (meta-language) and its own hidden meanings (para-language).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several approaches to visualise the communication process and Shannon and Weaver (1949) said that there are 4 necessary components (source, transmitter, receiver, destination).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information source -&gt; message -&gt; transmitter (encoding) -&gt; signal -&gt; noise source (message interference) -&gt; signal -&gt; receiver (decoding) -&gt; message -&gt; destination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This visualises that there can be a lot of problems along the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deaux et al. (1993) improved upon this model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-  both parties are sending and receiving (one talks, other one smiles).&lt;br /&gt;
-   both bring in expectations and understandings of â€œselfâ€? and â€œcontextâ€?&lt;br /&gt;
-   individuals needs to share some common ground&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this model, which was also used by Clark (1985), the emphasis is on the importance of context and the shared set of rules and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are often unaware of this and how we sound until we hear ourselves retrospectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of your communication needs you need first of all to stay informed and keep people informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding (sharing of the believes) your audience is critical to any form of communication and a key aspect of any presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of communication climate you can have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-  Open and Supportive&lt;br /&gt;
o   Descriptive&lt;br /&gt;
o   Solution-oriented&lt;br /&gt;
o   Open and honest&lt;br /&gt;
o   Egalitarian&lt;br /&gt;
o   Forgiving&lt;br /&gt;
o   Feedback&lt;br /&gt;
-   Closed&lt;br /&gt;
o   Judgemental&lt;br /&gt;
o   Controlling&lt;br /&gt;
o   Deceptive&lt;br /&gt;
o   Non-caring&lt;br /&gt;
o   Superior&lt;br /&gt;
o   Dogmatic&lt;br /&gt;
o   Hostile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously the open ones are much more pleasant to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening is another important part of communication and there are three types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-  Support listening: your role is to show that you understand without deterring the other person from continuing&lt;br /&gt;
-   Responding listening: relationship building. The sharing aspect of the communication is more important than the information-gathering aspect.&lt;br /&gt;
-   Retention listening: listening for facts and hard information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skills for active listening include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-  listening for message content&lt;br /&gt;
-   recognising barriers, seeking clarification&lt;br /&gt;
-   identify the purpose&lt;br /&gt;
-   respond with facial expressions and gestures&lt;br /&gt;
-   check (do verbal and non-verbal cues fit?)&lt;br /&gt;
-   encourage&lt;br /&gt;
-   reflect
&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There is a potential for conflict between the interests of any and all stakeholders in an organisation.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Society and business depend on each other.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Business:
- Employment
- Wealth creation: wages, dividends, taxes
- Material needs: goods, services
- Commitment: innovation, investment&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Society:
- Means of production: labour, raw material, land
- Infrastructure: transport, services
- Means of exchange: currency, banking, credit
- Supportive environment: law and order, justice, stability&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Organisations need to achieve a balance between philanthropy and self-interest in their community activities, aiming for social responsibility and avoiding the cynical use of cause-related marketing and pure philanthropy (Cannonâ€™s enlightenment matrix)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You also need to establish priorities based on predictability, competition and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty can be assessed in terms of objectives and consequences (Earl and Hopwoodâ€™s uncertainty matrix). The greater the level of uncertainty, the more managers need to be inspirational rather than mechanistic in their approach (see organic or mechanistic organisation). If things are unpredictable, then keep your options open. Collaboration is far more widespread than you may think. But for competition one needs to consider:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;a)  objectives for customers, suppliers, resources and influence
b)  in both the short and the longer term&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In successful organisations, assets are converted into organisational capabilities which enable the organisations to survive and flourish.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;physical assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know-how&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;If you are evaluating performance then your choice of what you measure and how you measure it gives a strong signal about your strategic direction and priorities. There are several indicators for performance:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economy: How cheaply can inputs be purchases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficiency: refers to the relationship between inputs and outputs; usually expresses as a ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effectiveness: how well the final outcomes and impact of an organisation meets its objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equity: (Gerechtigkeit) fair and equal treatment of all service users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The balanced scorecard assesses performance from four perspectives: financials, customers, internal processes and innovation/learning&lt;/p&gt;</p>
