  <div class="entry-content"><p>Again one of the posts that I don&#8217;t know where to put. It&#8217;s about a business venture in web development and will effect my life in general :) I am talking about <a href="http://www.oddpost.com/">Oddpost</a>, a web based e-mail application that is truely stunning. For now I didn&#8217;t like web based e-mail because of the lack of features and lack of integration but Oddpost seems to go in the right direction. Add to that that they have an integrated RSS Reader (which is actually how I found them), I am starting to be sold. $30 per year is actually OK and with their system of donating 10% of that to charity I am actually feeling good about it (stupid me :)).</p>

<p>What I like about the company is that they seem to be open, true, honest, &#8230; call it what you want. The best idea would probably be that they achieved what the cluetrain manifesto talked about (right or wrong it might be), being that the company is talking with a human voice. You can even see how <a href="http://www.oddpost.com/photoOdyssey.html">Ethan and Iain started the company</a> spiced up with a few pictures of animals.</p>

<p>Now if they integrate SyncML to let me Sync my Mobile Phone with the contacts Database and allow WAP or IMAP access to their System so I can check my mail on the go via their servers, then I am starting to really like it. First though, I need to continue some playing with the system.</p>

<p>Update: They provide IMAP access &#8230; where&#8217;s SyncML then? ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Granted, blogging has become some kind of hype at the moment but the personal touch enabled by blogging coupled with the bigger magazines out there starts to be interesting. I just added some blogs on my list after taking a look a <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/spotlight-full.shtml">Movable Type Spotlight Sites</a>. I didn&#8217;t know that <a href="http://www.about.com/">About.com</a> uses MT to manage their links, or rather to allow their contributors to manage their links. Amazing. I would really like to know since when they do that because this seems to be one of the most immense and oldest blogs arround then. But there are other interesting ones. <a href="http://archive.infoworld.com/techwatch/">InfoWorld&#8217;s TechWatch</a> seems to be a great site to stay up to speed on various happening out there in tech world that might not be so evident based on the major news sites out there. <a href="http://blog.inc.com/">Fresh Inc.</a> is the blog by the mag Inc.com. and great for those who have found their passion in business I&#8217;d say.</p>

<p>I really desperately need to set up an online RSS reader so I can manage all those things together because I am sick of switching and maintaining different lists. I tried one already but I don&#8217;t like it anymore, so I need to switch again. Any suggestions are welcome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;em&gt;(Originally published on <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)&lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;em /&gt;The organisational paradigm are the beliefs and assumptions that make up &quot;an organisation&#8217;s view of itself and its environment&quot; (Johnson, 1988). Together with:
- stories and myths
- symbols
- rituals and routines
- control systems
- organisational structures
- power structures
- symbols
it builds the &quot;cultural web&quot; or an organisation.</p>

<p>Deal and Kennedy (1982) defined culture as &#8216;the way we do things around here&#8217;. Some of the elements of the cultural web are formal mechanism and others are informal. The meaning of those are what is significant. This is again made visible through the stories and myths, often used for sensemaking of events and hence not always accurate but more about getting the point across. Stories can be enhanced through rituals and routines.</p>

<p>A richer culture definition comes from Wilson and Rosenfeld (1990, p.229):</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;&#8230;the basic values, ideologies and assumptions which guide and fashion individual and business behaviour. These values are evident in more tangible factors such as stories, ritual, language, and jargon, office decoration and layout and prevailing modes of dress among staff.&lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>This shows that organisational culture (what the &quot;other&quot; members value) is a very difficult to define beast, with corporate culture (what the dominant members value) being a small part of it. Often the values of the dominant are more important than of other individuals or even of society.</p>

<p>Culture can also be a capability or resource, also because in case it is a strong and homogeneous one, you might need less formal systems and procedures as control. To homogeneous can also mean group think though, which combined with a limited corporate (rather than organisational) view of culture can lead to too narrow horizons. A strong culture will include commitment to a strategic intent over a long time, making subsequent strategic shifts harder. A culture is a &quot;sticky&quot; factor that locks in an organisation.</p>

<p>In the public sector it is often tried to make responsiveness to the citizen part of the culture.</p>

<p>Many of our deep routed values have been shaped when we were young, teaching us what is right and what is wrong. Not all of them have to be codified in law.  The question is whether working ethically will lead to success and Hosmer (1994) argued that equitable acts lead to trust, which leads to commitment. This commitment, when it is co-operative and innovate, can lead to success. To behave ethically you need to go above the law though, to work within norms and values in a worldwide community/society.</p>

<p>There is a close link between national cultures and organisational cultures, which can be seen in the difference between Japanese and Western way of doing things. The Japanese are using something called &#8216;simultaneous loose-tight coupling&#8217; meaning that they have tight conformity to core values with looser control systems. These differences are not only rooted in culture though, but include financial, investment and policy for example. An analysis of 116000 IBM employees in the same or similar jobs found that culture, in relation to nationality, has some distinct dimensions that influence it:
- Power Distance: Acceptance of unequal power distribution
- Uncertainty Avoidance: Tolerance of uncertainty
- Individualism: Personal over Group achievement
- Masculinity: Dominance of masculine tendencies</p>

<p>The paradigm is empirically driven, built on experiences rather than a model of how things should be. They are built on beliefs that have repeatedly been validated. How can managers use this? In a top-down system the manager only pays attention to what he or she wants to pay attention to. In a bottom-up system, the management does not interfere with data.</p>

<p>As strategy making is a collective activity, we need to share each others maps and models of the corporation and the environment to find a collective course of action. This shows again that strategy is not linear and rational but more of a social and cultural contruct. The paradigm defines environmental &#8216;reality&#8217;. This makes it a powerful tool for coping with complex situations but also something that is a liability under change conditions. When performance of a company does not work out, we can fist find tighter control of our implementation, then we might reconstruct the strategy and only then would we attack and change our paradigm.</p>

<p>A knowledge creating company needs a special kind of culture and power structure. An example in the book is the middle-up-down process of knowledge management suggested by Japanese economics (Nonaka, 1991; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995).</p>

<p>Top down management assumes that only top managers are able to create knowledge and it only exists to be processed and/or implemented. It is good for dealing with explicit knowledge. Buttom-up management makes work autonomous allowing knowledge to be created at the bottom. It is good for tacit knowledge but due to the inherent autonomy this knowledge is extremely hard to communicate.</p>

<p>In the top-down model the fate of the company might be aligned with the fate of a few top managers and bottom-up knowledge creation can be very slow as it rests on the patience and talent of the individual.</p>

<p>Japanese companies seem to create knowledge in the middle management through a spiral conversion process involving top and front-line employees. They serve as the strategic knot. Knowledge can be interpreted differently in a different context and middle-management is used to orient knowledge creation towards a purposeful end, making available frameworks to sense making of new knowledge. Top management creates a dream and middle management develops concrete concepts for the front-line.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Culture, Power and Change&lt;/strong&gt;</p>

<p>The paradigm is the outcome of all elements of the cultural web and cultural change likely needs to attack this paradigm head on, it must be challenged, discredited and devalued. This can be done by:
- use of an outsider who has little commitment to the current paradigm
- exposing the paradigm
- power reconfiguration
- advocating and legitimising dissent
- powerful advocacy</p>

<p>Senge sees leadership as culture-formation through building shared vision.</p>

<p>In terms of recovery and turnaround strategies there are a few things that generally are done (Slatter, 1984):
- change of management
- strong central financial control
- organisational change and decentralisation
- product-market re-orientation
- improving marketing
- growth via acquisitions
- asset reduction
- cost reduction
- investment
- dept rstructuring and other financial strategies</p>

<p>Important here is cash flow.  It is also important to focus on those 20 per cent of the factors involved that have 80% of the impact (Pareto principle).</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Power&lt;/strong&gt;</p>

<p>Mintzberg (1983): &lt;em&gt;Power is the capacity to effect (or affect) organisational outcomes&lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>A relationship is needed for power to be present. This relationship leads to interdependencies and then one can argue that power is about the degree of dependence on the othe part of the relationship. The power of a unit can be seen in:
- the importance of the resource
- the control over allocation
- the substitutability of the resource</p>

<p>Important relationships are your stakeholders and the most important ones as of a study chaired by Sir Anthony Cleaver are:
- shareholders
- employees
- customers
- suppliers
- community</p>

<p>The power of any of those relationships depends on your paradigm and the setting of your cultural web.</p>

<p>Remember the following about managing strategy and power:
- power is present in all ofrms of the organisation
- understand power structures and how to management them
- restructure dependencies and resource allocation to manage power
- long-term external relationships are gaining importance and shared expectations are needed here
- you need to balance power</p>

<p>Lord Acton (1887): &lt;em&gt;Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.&lt;/em&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seems that MS is sued again. This time the important thing is that MS claims that 7 distinct people, erased the exact same e-mail messages from their personal computers and the servers over a period of 35 weeks (1 week previous till one month after meetings with the company Burst). These were the e-mails concerning their negotiations of intelectual property licensing with Burst. Seriously, this cannot happen. Simply too unlikely. Period. More can be found in Cringely&#8217;s article. Watch this quote:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;So the judge ordered Microsoft to produce the missing messages. The employee PCs, the servers, and the off-site backup tapes have to be searched and soon. The Microsoft lawyers complained that would be like finding a needle in a haystack. The judge reminded them that it was they who had put that needle in the hay. &lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Too good. Go judge, go!  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20030828.html">The article</a> holds some other interesting information like keeping a lawyer at meetings to keep the information of that meeting out of the courts because its a priviledged client relationship all of the sudden. (Remember to cc the lawyer ;)).</p>

<p>The problem is that while MS might have banked on Burst.com to die, they didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;The only problem for Microsoft was Burst did not die. The company shrank to two employees, raised enough money to continue operating for two to three years, then found lawyers willing to take the case on contingency in exchange for a healthy chunk of any damage award. The lawyers are assuming all the financial risk, but they also have a chance to earn a payday worth hundreds of millions of dollars. &lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>The Burst.com CEO was wondering if MS was just needing to win. Cringely adds:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;It isn&#8217;t that Microsoft needs so much to win, but that they are desperate not to lose. The company functions in part by encouraging paranoia. &quot;Sure things look good now, but that could change in an instant.&quot; That was Microsoft&#8217;s primary defense in its case with the Department of Justice &#8211; not that it didn&#8217;t have an effective monopoly, but that it had what it thought was a fragile monopoly. That&#8217;s why Microsoft needs a war chest of nearly $50 billion because that instant could come and the cash would be needed.  &lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>I have to admit that this is a particularly good article by Cringely. Check the end:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt; E-mail is a world of distorted values where it is easy to go too far, and easier still to read things wrong and go even further.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Deep wording, maybe a bit over the top to sound cool but true none the less.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;I doubt that Bill Gates told anyone to destroy Burst.com, but I KNOW Bill Gates told the people of Microsoft that the company&#8217;s future lay in digital media and that cross-platform products were, by their very nature, a threat to Windows hegemony. It is only a short step then to erasing e-mails because doing anything less would be helping to kill Microsoft, not Burst. It&#8217;s them or us, right?&lt;/I&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>LOL. Just read this one on a message board:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;As the coals from our barbecue burned down, our hosts passed out marshmallows and long roasting forks.  Just then, two fire trucks roared by, sirens blaring, lights flashing. They stopped at a house right down the block. All twelve of us raced out of the back yard, down the street, where we found the owners of the blazing house standing by helplessly. They glared at us with looks of disgust.</p>

<p>Suddenly, we realized that we were all still holding our roasting forks with marshmallows on them&#8230; &lt;/I&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another thing in relation to Charlie&#8217;s Angels full throttle, the new movie. I have rarely seen a movie with so much branding. Boy oh boy! I mean they see a footprint on the floor and say something like &quot;That&#8217;s the Air Jordan from Nike, it&#8217;s very rare and was only sold at Foot Locker in Nebraska.&quot; or something like that. Then you suddenly see them send arround pictures for no apparent reason I can remember and you see T-Mobile huge on a notebook screen, T-Mobile t-zones actually, something that would surely be used by high tech special agents. Then you see motorcycles and BIG Yamaha prints on the side. Lots of stuff like this, amazing. I wonder how much money they made through the branding alone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0305357">Charlie&#8217;s Angels: Full Throttle</a> yesterday and boy was it a bad movie. I mean over the top action can be good but 100% unbelievable action is too much. On top of that the film has absolutely no consistent story and if there is a story it is much too hard to follow. It seems that it&#8217;s more a puzzle of several stories. In other movies the bad guy is not clear and you change your view who the bad guy is frequently with twists in the plot. Here, the bad guy simply changes from one person to the next. The Angels looked great though :)</p>
