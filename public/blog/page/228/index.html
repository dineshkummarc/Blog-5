  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two friends sat on our roof yesterday and they lit some torches attached to the railings. They could be seen all over the market which resulted in a girl and a boy who just finished school ringing the door bell because they wanted to look at the view and later another couple, close to 30, came up too.</p>

<p>This place is a real nice way to meet new people. We had some nice conversations at that time. I would have not rang a door bell though at 2300 in a place I did not know. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well time to wind it down now.</p>

<p>Friday I came back to Cologne after a short stay in Aachen. Right when I arrived we prepared to go to the Ringfest.</p>

<p>Ringfest is a yearly happening in Cologne to the time of the Popkomm. Popkomm is a music industry convention and it normally starts Wednesday (industry only). Then on Friday Ringfest starts which puts a lot of bands all over the inner ring (or part of it) of Cologne. You can find more info here: <a href="http://www.musikfest-am-ring.de/info/willkommen.html">http://www.musikfest-am-ring.de/info/willkommen.html</a></p>

<p>As you might notice these are mostly pop bands and dance acts but the entire weekend gets close to 3.000.000 people to cologne! The city is packed!</p>

<p>Now on Friday we just wanted around then entire strip where the bands are playing to get a bit of the vibe, ate some tasty food and then went on to drink a few beers in front of the Crown Plaza. They had their own beer booth and food and most of the hotel staff was there because they got 50% off of the prices. ;)</p>

<p>We had a wonderful time listening to music and talking to a lot of people. We met two of the new trainees of the hotel who both seem to be very nice.</p>

<p>When we went to bed we knew we had to get up relatively early the next day because a friend of ours had their wedding. 1 hour away by car. Far far away in the country :)</p>

<p>The church was a very nice small one on a hill which already put us in a good mood. Then they played the star wars music when the bride came in, which, I have to say, I found a bit weird, at least in the church :) But the bride looked wonderful, as it should be. When the ceremony was done and we all met ourside there was a lot of Uhhhs and Ahhhs and Ohhhs as everybody hugged them and congratulated them :) His football club and some people from his work were also there to congratulate.</p>

<p>The drive to the venue where we would be celebrating was wonderful. A huge row of cars with all drivers steering their cars with the hands on the horns :) Hell, nobody knew us there anyway :)</p>

<p>The place where we celebrated was amazing. Hard to describe really. Like several houses with a place in the middle and walls around it. Hmm&#8230; :) You felt like you had freedom to go to a lot of places but still it was very private.</p>

<p>There were a lot of kids and all the people I met were really wonderful. The food was amazing, cooked by only one woman which nobody understood how she was able to do that :)</p>

<p>Then of course there were some nice games played with the newly wed couple which were a lot of fun most of the time :)</p>

<p>The cool thing is that all this started at 12:30 and ended around 2:00 (+ drive home), and it felt like 3 or 4 hours. Must have been good ;)</p>

<p>Today was a bit hard getting up then but we wanted to go to the Ringfest another time. We met three friends at the Hotel again at 1400 and first stayed there for a bit listening to the rock bands playing next to it. But then we wanted to get some real pop/dance in our heads, just for the fun of it and went to the stage of RTL, one of the big television channels here in germany.</p>

<p>After having some food again on the way (sometimes you wonder if this festival is done for eating or listening to music) we arrived and already got in the pop mood. Woohooo! :) So we saw BB Mak, Zee, Rednex, Hermes House Band, Janette Biedermann, Wonderwall, 3. generation &#8230; all very very popish and dancish and chatish. And then came SPN-X, total punk rock :) Followed by the ultra popy No Angels, who formed via a TV show (Pop Stars, made to get a 5 girls group to together, No Angels is the result).</p>

<p>With No Angels it was <em>really</em> full. They <em>are</em> well known and you had all these small kids sitting there and screaming their heads of and singing every word of the text. You had to wonder if they know what they are singing. They could not be able to speak english already :)</p>

<p>Then, to clear my head we went back to the hotel and 10 minutes later I got my head cleared with 5 songs from Dog Eat Dog. The mood was amazing, mostly because it was one of the bigger (rock) bands that were playing on the Ringfest. It was a lot of fun. The singer got carried on the crowed and the guitarist jumped of the stage into a water pool which was there to catch the water that was let from the roof sometimes (not rain but a system that created a water wall). It must have hurt. :) I mean the stage was a bit less than 2 meters high and I doubt that the water was that deep down there. He jumped down sideways like a WWF wrestler, probably doing that after his guitare wouldn&#8217;t work right in the first two songs ;)</p>

<p>Well now we are finally back. Ahhh&#8230; my feet are very happy about that really. They can save up now to the next wedding on the 7th or 8th of next month. Lot&#8217;s of weddings at the moment around me, should maybe get me thinking. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First I have to say that this bed is killing me. Really! It&#8217;s an old bad and hangs down in the middle, which is ok. But the added bonus is that it is only 2 meters long and solid borders. That means that I have to use the diagonal to really be comfortable. Ah well&#8230; I will survive :)</p>

<p>This morning the weather actually was emm&#8230; ok. But only for a little bit when the wind started to take up so much that you could not even launch a kite. It was really hard wind and then it started to rain. Hmmm&#8230; super. :)</p>

<p>We then decided to finally go to the company that own the appartment (yesterday the weather was too bad) to exchange keys. We only have a spare one now and it stopped raining so we thought it was a good time to go. Off we go to the city to learn that Wednesday their offices are closed ;) At least we got our pizza for today from the supermarket there.</p>

<p>Now the sun has come out and one might call this good weather, the only problem is the wind, which is why there are no people on the beach either. You&#8217;d be covered with sand in a minute. We sat in front of the appartment though to read and soak in a bit of sun and this was great. Whatever happens these few days are very relaxing.</p>

<p>But this brough on a good time to take some photos. The are below.</p>

<p>So here are the photos I took.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=&quot;http://oliver.thylmann.com/photos-public/20010808-de_haan/01-bw1-small.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;Black and White picture of the sand. Looks creapy I think. I really like it.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=&quot;http://oliver.thylmann.com/photos-public/20010808-de_haan/17-bubbles-small.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;bR&gt;This is taken with the camera really close to the ground. I like this as it is a very still and silent image of a very moving situation.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=&quot;http://oliver.thylmann.com/photos-public/20010808-de_haan/20-ocean_sun_overexposed-small.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;bR&gt;I took some photos like this as I liked the sun in the corner. This one is a bit overexposed which makes for a very nice effect I think.</p>

<p>Now on to cooking dinner and finishing off the OU course. This might be the first time I am done with the first book before the tutorial. It will be interesting :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s simply raining. It&#8217;s just bad weather. And we are sitting at the coast. Damn! It&#8217;s just no fun.</p>

<p>Well that&#8217;s not quite true. We are having a lot of fun up till now it&#8217;s just that it does not involve the sun :) Interestingly enough though, the place above us is full of children and the bad weather results in these children now running back and forth without interruption. :)</p>

<p>We can still hope that the weather will get better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We just arrived at the belgium cost. The weather is not too good but at least it is not raining. There is a lot of wind though which will be fun to play with the kite. It was also nice for walking around on the sea front, especially with the wind blowing directly into you face.</p>

<p>Otherwise the place is just amazing as last time and I think the following week will be very good. I have a lot to do and read and I think I will get my energy tanks filled up well.</p>

<p>We went out for a nice dinner today too. I had scampi au facon du chef, which were great. Really nice sauce and all. Together with the hoegaarden I am totally feeling like being in Belgium again. Wonderful :)</p>
