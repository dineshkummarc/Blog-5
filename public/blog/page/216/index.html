  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday we went to the <a href="http://www.linus-talentprobe.de/">Linus Talentprobe</a> (translated it would mean something like Linus&#8217; Tallentshow) with some friends and it was a blast. It was the first show of this summer and marked 30 years of the Talentprobe. To really get an idea you have to be there but in short, this is probably one of the toughest tallentshows out there. You can send in your tape and they might let you perform. You will then try to impress a crowd of over 8000 people, a crowd that is very hard to impress. You have to be very good to impress this crowd, which everybody who performs knows. If you are just a little bit bad, everybody will shout and scream, the crowd will sing a different song, everybody will sit down and then, from the front, get up to perform a wave, or everybody turns around and parties in the other direction. At the end, the winner is found based on applaus. Always exciting, if you are not on stage that is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If anyone of you is looking for a content management system for your web site and you are using IE, you need to consider <a href="http://www.typo3.org/">Typo 3</a>, a very powerful free system. I am currently thinking about using it myself but need to look further into how  well it works for live updating pages and things. Probably very well as it is based on PHP but this might require some scripting, meaning writing the layout/interaction of the page within the Type 3 Script. The interface is just amazing though and you can do anything. I would even consider this one amazing if it cost money.</p>

<p>You can for example make different users and say exactly which kind of access they have, which is nice, but above that you can also say which different function these people will be able to use. Obviously, they will only see those functions they can use. So you can give somebody the right to write stories, edit them, but not the right to put them on the front page and viewable by everybody.</p>

<p>You have a real text editor in there with buttons for bold and several templates for sites that makes deploying your site easily. If you want to change the template you go to a screen that has a screenshot of the layout, with numbers floating above it telling you what each section is and what you can edit in that section. change the logo, the background color, the way the links appear (in automatically generated gif images for example with mouse-over effects and everything).</p>

<p>The only request the author has is emm&#8230; not using it for anything that is against the bibel, as he is a christ with all his mind and body and soul. Check it out, seriously.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google is currently testing a new service called <a href="https://answers.google.com/answers/main">Google Answers</a>, which is something that I wanted when I first came to the net. They are looking for a group of freelance research staff that answer questions. Customers will be able to ask a question, say how much that answer is worth for them (currently between $4 and $50) and the researcher will get 75% of that money. I sent in a request to become a researcher, writing a short paragraph about why I want to do this and got accepted to try my luck. This got me into the second round in which they send you 25 questions of which you need to answer 5 and send them back, which I did yesterday. They are currently being reviewed. Would be fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally Published on infoSync) Woohooo&#8230; buzz word attack! In the red corner, Instant Messaging (IM) with the likes of ICQ, AIM and MSN Messenger; all having turned into amazing success stories on the Desktop. Mirabilis, the Israeli company that brought us the first of them all, ICQ, ended up being bought by AOL in 1998, only 12 months after founding, for over 280 million USD - in cash, not counting the additional performance incentives!</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>In the black corner, Multimedia messaging (MMS), the next wave in data communications over wireless networks, replacing SMS as the next messaging standard (you can read more about MMS <a href="http://www.infosync.no/show.php?id=1301">here</a>). The Register recently <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/24190.html">revealed</a> that Nokia charges $6.3 million USD for an MMS server capable of handling 10,000 users. The messaging is where the money is. Welcome to the next big wireless fight.</p>

<p>MMS, recently introduced by Vodafone in Germany, is supposed to bring us even more, and of course better, ways of communicating with all kinds of people, which is one of the reasons why the biggest players in the wireless arena have joined forces to make MMS a reality. They want to be absolutely certain that there is one common standard in all MMS-capable devices of the future - similar to how SMS works now - in order for messaging to work seamlessly wherever you are and with whomever you&#8217;d like to exchange messages with.</p>

<p>IM, on the contrary, is already available on Desktops worldwide and helps both individuals and companies to streamline their communications, as well as reach out and get in touch with just about anyone. But don&#8217;t expect the mobile phone companies to ignore the IM space.</p>

<p>In fact, Nokia, Ericsson and a number of other manufacturers are participating in the <a href="http://www.infosync.no/show.php?id=1446">Wireless Village initiative</a>, which has as its goal to create a global standard for Instant Messaging on mobile devices. Companies in the mobile space are doing their best to avoid repeating the same compatibility mess as on the Desktop, where services such ICQ, MSM and AIM can&#8217;t talk to one another - while applications that aim to provide cross-platform IM compatibility such as Odigo, Trillian and others frequently have problems connecting to at least one of the several services. Full interoperability is something mobile phone manufacturers and carriers believe to be crucial for the success of IM on mobile devices. It will not be an option in the long run to have 3 or more different IM applications running on your phone at the same time just so you can stay in contact with your friends and colleagues.</p>

<p>This is where Microsoft comes in with the Smartphone and Pocket PC 2002 platforms. All devices running on those platforms include MSN Messenger, one of the most widely used IM clients out there. In a recent <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1033-843497.html">article</a> by C|Net, it became clear that while Microsoft might be supporting MMS in the future, the copmany has not made up its mind just yet and is currently looking into all options. If MMS will become the huge success many predict, then why doesn&#8217;t Microsoft have a firm commitment to the emerging standard? Because Microsoft is looking at putting in place a translator that will allow users to send and receive MMS messages from within MSN Messenger.</p>

<p>To understand the big picture it&#8217;s necessary to take a step back, and while we&#8217;re at it, try shutting out all of the hype and focus only at what both technologies can currently do, or promise to do. In doing so, you will see that current IM clients can largely do what MMS is said to be able to do. You can send pictures, audio, documents - anything, really. If Microsoft really adds features to MSN Messenger that will let users send and receive MMS messages and makes sure such capabilities are delivered with every Pocket PC and Smartphone device shipped, that would not only give those devices MMS capabilities but a full IM client on top of that. These features, coupled with full Exchange Server support, could be a major selling point at a sales pitch to corporations.</p>

<p>But who is MMS really designed for? Mainly the same people who are active users of SMS now, meaning the youth market and then some. The entertainment or fun aspect of SMS, which makes the youth out there use it, was a major driver for adoption and only now are businesses starting to see the interesting opportunities that SMS might bring them. Still, though, SMS is mostly an easy to use method of sending short, uninterruptive and discrete text messages to friends or colleagues. On top of that, in Europe you can send an SMS to absolutely anyone, and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to try to remember whether your friend or colleague has a supported phone - which is a direct result of the cooperation between mobile phone manufacturers and carriers. MMS will work the same way, if everything goes according to plan. If the receiving phone doesn&amp;rsquo;t support the MMS standard, then the user of that phone will be told where to get the MMS at a later date, over WAP or from a PC with an Internet connection, and a lot of effort will also be placed into making the MMS system within your phone as user friendly as possible.</p>

<p>Microsoft&#8217;s battle plan seems to have one ultimate goal; to keep the standard in their hands, which the company has a knack for doing - and seen from a purely business perspective, it&#8217;s not a bad idea. The only problem is that the mobile world has learnt that non-compatible standards are bad for their business. Just look at ring tone and logo messaging, which already works seamlessly between Nokia phones. There are numerous websites nowadays where Nokia phone users can download logos and ring tones to make their phones more personal. Other companies saw the opportunity but didn&amp;rsquo;t want to license Nokia&amp;rsquo;s system which would effectively hand over control of SMS messaging to Nokia. This has lead other manufacturers to introduce EMS (Enhanced Messaging System), which brings the same enhancements, but is incompatible with Nokia&amp;rsquo;s proprietary SMS-based system. With EMS, you can also download ring tones and logos for other phones from web sites. If a user wants to send a ring tone to a friend though, both the sending and receiving phone will either have to be Nokia phones or EMS capable phones. A message with a ring tone or logo sent between a Nokia and a Siemens phone, will come out garbled on one end. For users, this means they won&#8217;t be able to blindly send a message with a logo or a small ring tone to friends. They know that some will not be able to receive it. SMS works between all phones. Sending ring tones doesn&amp;rsquo;t. SMS is a huge success. Sending ring tones from phones to phones is not taking off because it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work at all times, and in that sense, while keeping a standard under your control could prove to be a good business idea, the wireless arena might not be the place to do it.</p>

<p>With MMS, manufacturers don&amp;rsquo;t want the ring tone and logo incompatibility mess to take place all over again, but rather to make sure MMS will work everywhere. This is easily taken care of though, since MMS relies on a special server which is able to find out if the phone can do MMS or not and react accordingly. E-Plus in Germany, for example, just recently introduced i-mode and will be using such a server to bring MMS to the mobile phones of their i-mode users even though i-mode phones don&#8217;t have native support for MMS. They just use the i-mode/SMS system to alert a user of an MMS message which can then be picked up. One a side note, it&#8217;ll be interesting to see whether - and, if so, how - they add a method for sending MMS messages to their i-mode service.</p>

<p>What Microsoft seems to be planning could be very similar to what E-Plus does. Most, if not all devices using Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s current mobile platforms, will be powerful enough to connect to the web via WAP and even access a standard HTML page. That means they can receive an SMS with a URL to the MMS message. In reality, receiving MMS messages isn&amp;rsquo;t a difficult feat as long as the device is powerful enough in the sense of containing a color display, good sound capabilities and an efficient network connection. Sending MMS messages easily will require a good interface which will most likely be easier to put directly on the phone than on some web/WAP page.</p>

<p>What Microsoft is without doubt going to make sure of, though, is that Instant Messaging is present on all its platforms - most likely because this could be important for getting into the corporate market, which is the company&#8217;s primary focus. Remember; Microsoft has approached the mobile platforms market coming from an Operating System and Office business angle, where customers usually buy a few thousand licenses at a time. The mobile phone business doesn&#8217;t really work like that, but is rather made up by manufacturers who build their own operating systems and sell directly to individual users one at a time - a lot of the time. Most people consider their mobile phone a personal gadget and do not have the same relation to it as to their corporate Desktop PC, and this is the way manufacturers such as Nokia attack the market.</p>

<p>Nokia wants to appeal to a lot of different users, all with different tastes and experience. There needs to be one system that is easily understandable and easy to use by everybody and easy to use on any phone, which means e-mail and IM in their present forms and implementations on mobile devices can quickly be discarded. On a small screen, without the capability of a full presence listing of your buddies and no option for overlapping windows, due to OS capabilities or size, IM would be overkill. On top of that, manufacturers want complete interoperability, something IM in its current state cannot provide unless a translation solution is put in place - which would be a far cry from a good solution.</p>

<p>As you&amp;rsquo;ll have noticed by now, there&amp;rsquo;s a distinct difference in the way manufacturers and Microsoft attack the mobile devices market. Nokia and other manufacturers want the entire market with an easy to use and amazingly scalable solution, while MS wants the corporate market with their own solutions no matter what. Simply put, Microsoft is going at it from an angle that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been attempted before, and there&amp;rsquo;s no clear winner as of yet.</p>

<p>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s marketing people can win this war since they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have another choice than play with the cards that have been dealt them from the top brass - unless the company suddenly changes its attitude and becomes an open player. The business guy that is on a business trip wants to be connected to the office but if there is an option to send a rich multimedia message to his wife from the future holiday spot he just found, then he will not be using MSN Messenger but MMS, if he can. It needs to be simple. Phone companies know that. Microsoft won&amp;rsquo;t be able to integrate such a solution into the company&amp;rsquo;s overall battle plan easily.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wonderful. I just got this thing set up:</p>

<p>http://www.audioline.de/telefone/schnurlo/sl08.htm</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a portable DECT phone with a headset and costs only 50 EUR, which is far cheaper than anything else on the market. It&#8217;s nice and small and seems to work like a charm.</p>

<p>On a related note I was at the Germany - USA ice hockey game here in Cologne yesterday. Over 18000 fans and 99% germans of course. It&#8217;s interesting that when the US team came in you saw them scating around on the ice and they recited the names. Then the german team came in, spotlights, music, pictures of each player on the overhead display, the crowd roaring ;) I presume it&#8217;s the same when germany plays in the US though. The cool thing is, germany won 5 to 3 and you can imagine how the crowd went wild. Intense. I think I have to go to a few more hockey games.</p>

<p>The thing I have to think about now is if I should go to the US WWF show on the first of may. Not that I like wrestling but with this being the only show in germany &#8230; it might be fun to watch the show.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the US people among you, AT&amp;T recently launched mMode which is similar to i-mode, which again, came from NTT DoCoMo, who have invested in AT&amp;T Wireless. They have also invested in KPN. KPN own e-plus. Now e-plus launched i-mode. Now I am getting the phone for a month to test it. Wopiiiii ;) Sadly I can only spend 50 EUR and anything above that I have to pay for myself. Would have liked it unlimited. Ah well, I can only keep it a month anyway ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just read this on the TMF discussion boards:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;&quot;Negotiations In Israel&quot;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister of Israel sits down with Arafat
at the beginning of negotiations regarding the
resolution of the conflict. The Prime Minister
requests that he be allowed to begin with a story.
Arafat replies, &quot;Of course.&quot;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister begins his story: &quot;Years before
the Israelites came to the Promised Land and settled
here, Moses led them for 40 years through the desert.
The Israelites began complaining that they were thirsty
and, lo and behold, a miracle occurred and a stream
appeared before them. They drank their fill and then
decided to take advantage of the stream to do some
bathing &#8211; including Moses. When Moses came out
of the water, he found that all his clothing was missing.</p>

<p>&quot;Who took my clothes?&quot; Moses asked those around him.</p>

<p>&quot;It was the Palestinians,&quot; replied the Israelites&#8211;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; objected Arafat immediately, &quot;there were
no Palestinians during the time of Moses!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; replies the Prime Minister, &quot;Now that we&#8217;ve got
that settled, let&#8217;s begin our negotiations.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;</p>
