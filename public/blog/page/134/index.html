  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a new Bloglines feature, <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/about/news#56">References</a>. What that means is that if you get an entry within your bloglines account on any feed your are reading and others have already referenced it, you will see the reference count with the story. Clicking it will show you all the references. Really nice to get the full picture in a bigger story I have to say. Great stuff.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally. I should be spam free. My wonderful brother just installed SurgeMail by <a href="http://www.netwinsite.com/">Netwinsite</a> as a replacement for Dmail, also from them, which was our previous eMail server. SurgeMail is kind of the new version, still has a few problems, but works overall. This has integrated a friends system, which makes sure that I only get eMail from people that authenticate themselves. For now, I should be spamfree. I already see the logs filling with people trying without success to eMail me. HA! Very good. This might even make me cancel <a href="http://www.oddpost.com/">Oddpost</a>, which I love but don&#8217;t really need anymore, as I mostly used it for getting rid of spam. That is taken care of now. I can likely use mail2web for getting my eMails at works, which sadly blocks so many ports that the standard web interface of SurgeMail doesn&#8217;t work out of the box. I will have to see if I can get arround that too, because the interface is really nice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>News.com has a <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1038-5198903.html?tag=cd.top">nice summary of the information arround the Google IPO</a>, which gives a few details on who they will likely go public and/or now have internal fights about doing it or not. Investors would surely love to do it, but Google likely does not want to file.</p>

<p>This ties in with the fact that new rumors are starting about what Google will eventually become. They surely started as a search engine, no questions asked, but they might be moving into become the OS of choice for the future. I find things via google, I connect to friends via Orkut, I have my email at Gmail, I get questions answered with Google Answers, I read my news via Google News, I blog via Blogger (I don&#8217;t but you get the point ;)) &#8230; this list could very well be extended.</p>

<p>If this is their goal, they would have to disclose that most likely. It would also make it a very much more viable business to invest in. AdSense is a pay-per-click network with some intelligence on top of it. Their rise or fall banks on getting higher CPM rates via their clicks on sites they need to buy traffic on. Porn sites are running their networks on a per sale affiliate basis, for a reason, because clicks can be faked.</p>

<p>I want them to go public, or rather, I just want to read the damn SEC filing. :)</p>

Technology Review has a few nice pointers about the Google Infrastructure and how it is similar to Akamai, in some aspects.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://johnporcaro.typepad.com/blog/">John Porcaro</a> links to a very nice (albeit short) analysis of the retail market and consolidation within it in <a href="http://johnporcaro.typepad.com/blog/2004/04/retail_consolid.html">a recent post</a>. It includes a very nice graphic and the trend is believable. What that means is that either you are cheap or you have some added value. This is not much else than what Porter has been saying all along if you think about it with his <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/2003/08/book_5_choosing.html">generic strategies</a></p>

<p>&lt;i&gt;- cost leadership: you set out to be a low cost provider, which gives you additional flexibility in your pricing structures
- differentiation: select attributes for your products that are perceived as important to be able to have a price premium. You still need a good cost position
- focus: using cost or differentiation you outperform your competition by focusing on a special part of the market&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>So all in all you still need a good base price. I won&#8217;t spend 20% more to get service. The question is then if there shouldn&#8217;t be place for somebody that provides services above Wal-Mart, for example. It might be hard to get in there.</p>

<p>Another thing is important: &lt;I&gt;Bowman and Asch (1996) added that in our complex world, a lot need to be kept in mind. Customers for example do not care about the input side (costs) and not all differentiators lead to a price premium. You need to pay attention that you are not forcing yourself into one box.&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>The your <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/2003/08/the_structuring.html">structure of the organisation</a> needs to fit to what kind of strategy you choose. Your entire vibe and culture too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I made the leap. I am fearless. After reading <a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/002009.shtml">Heiko&#8217;s post on Allofmp3</a>, I registered, which was a leap in itself, with the company behind it being russian and you can never be sure if that&#8217;s a good thing. But they are working with <a href="http://www.cyberplat.com/">Cyberplat</a> for billing and they seem to be big and working with Quelle, one of the biggest mail order places, at least in Germany. So what is <a href="http://www.allofmp3.com/">Allofmp3</a>? It&#8217;s a kind of music shop, with a twist. It allows you to get practically any album and pay for it. You don&#8217;t pay per song though, you pay per MB transferred and you can decide which kind of encoding method you want. I chose high quality (196kbit/s) MP3s. The files are then, potentially if they are not available yet, encoded live from the CD, in which case you might have to wait a bit. I didn&#8217;t have to as mine were available. I paid a bit of $1 for the album loading up my account with $5, which probably means that I will be billed more for using the card outside of europe than anything else ;)</p>

<p>The files came back just fine, with full ID3 tages and great sound. For now I am happy. The question might be if that is really legal outside of russia, because I am in Germany and they are paying people in Russia. I have no clue really but I do presume that it is ok. We will see how it goes, especially what will be deducted from my card. For now, a good experience I have to say.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; You can get a list of all the files you want to download from &quot;List all files&quot; in the My Downloads section. Copy that into a text file and you can use something like wget on unix/osx with the &#8211;input-file= argument to download them one by one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The source of a spam-bot/worm is out (<a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/46634">german article</a>) and virus people are already shivering. The thing is that this tool can do practically everything, from extracting Registration-Keys from Games or run on IRC-Networks. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what comes out of this. I really would like to see Google&#8217;s ideas against this type of thing, meaning simply clicking arround in AdSense.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002599.html">this post by David Weinberger</a> I just found <a href="http://www.webnevesht.com/en/weblog/">Mohammad Ali Abtahi&#8217;s Blog</a> and he is no less than the vice president (sounds weird I know ;)) of Iran! His views are amazing, e.g. from his short bio:</p>

<p>&lt;i&gt;Finally, the only way to salve Iran would be to bring about reforms that would fully democratize the Iranian society, and that would respect norms and practices of our traditions and religion. I have always held the Late Leader of Islamic Revolution in high esteem and have remained loyal to all his ideals and I treasure being in service of my Iranian people.&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>Take a look at his <a href="http://www.webnevesht.com/en/weblog/?id=1191107068">post about the coffee ritual</a> and his views on <a href="http://www.webnevesht.com/en/weblog/?id=1700103450">why the problems in Iraq help Bush</a>. I do also love the words on the side of his blog: &lt;I&gt;Let me be myself - Mohammad Ali Abtahi - in this website: regardless of my official and governmental status&lt;/i&gt;. He also has some nice photos from Iran but &#8230; I can&#8217;t find his RSS/Atom Feed! I&#8217;d like to follow that one because I like what he has written up till now (at least what I have read) and his personal openess which is rarely found in other countries and which I would have never expected in the Iran!</p>
