  <div class="entry-content"><p>Amazon has a press release out with some interesting numbers for 2007, for those interested in them. It&#8217;s already been going around the web, but here are some I really like and a few further links at the end. (Data seems to include .com, .co.uk, .de, .fr, .co.jp, .ca)
&lt;ol&gt;</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Busiest Day December 10th: 5.4 million items ordered, 62,5 per second!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I see this again and again, most recently in <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2007/12/27/dear-google-reader-use-open-social-to-figure-out-who-my-friends-are/">this post</a> about Google Reader. There VentureBeat argues that Google should use <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/">OpenSocial</a> to find out who my friends are and hence who can read my shared items. While a nice idea, this is totally not what OpenSocial is, at least not in its first incarnation. This was confirmed to my on le web 3 this year.</p>

<p>The thing is that OpenSocial is only about allowing your to write an app/widget and have it run anywhere, more or less. You will have one hock inside Ning, LinkedIn, and whoever else is a member to get the friends of the current user and then do stuff with it. I am not even sure if you can get the friends but if you do you will get the friends of the currently logged in user in the system you are on. It&#8217;s not like you can export your social graph and find your friends on LinkedIn for use inside Google Reader. That is not the point of this first verison. It is just there to give a bigger possible install base for your applications.</p>

<p>With that said, further going through my &quot;still to read and possibly write about&quot; items :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Congrats to the team over at <a href="http://kyte.tv">Kyte.tv</a>, they are developing a really nice system. I am especially thinking about the mobile part here. The app is really nice and allows me to easily send videos and pictures from my phone. I&#8217;d really like the system to allow for posting of single videos directly to my blog, because that is really what I want, but at the moment you just have a channel which is a bit of a pain. I don&#8217;t want a channel. But I do expect them doing a lot with the $15 million, especially on the mobile front. At least I hope that they do not spend it all on support people. Ever notice that whenever you post something a nice girl (most of the time) comes into your chat saying what a cool video it is? Interestingly enough these girls (if they are girls) know very well how the entire Kyte.tv system works. Interesting strategy to stress the interaction part. Here is one quote from my last video: &quot;but i think the main feature of kye is the interactivity&quot;. Now is that is not scripted ;)</p>

<p>One competition they just got though is from Qik, see my <a href="http://qik.com/oliver">Profile here</a>. Robert Scoble recently <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/12/17/justintv-watch-out/">blogged</a> about them and is <a href="http://qik.com/scobleizer">posting videos like crazy</a>. When you do a live feed on your Kyte.tv Nokia app you just send pictures, on Qik you send a video, live, from your mobile phone. Kick ass! The vision of <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2006/01/12/press-no-longer-first-on-the-scene/">everybody being press</a> gets further and further! I am lovin&#8217; it.</p>

<p>Need to play a bit more with both system and looking forward to Kyte.tv doing full streaming and allowing me to automatically post to my blog, if <a href="http://seesmic.com/">Seesmic</a> does not get their first ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jason Calcanis must be happy. Google just validated his entire business model with <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/12/encouraging-people-to-contribute.html">this post</a>. What Jason talked about at le web 3 is that we need to work together to get the spam out of the internet and work together to do that. It is obviously directly linked with his editor driven search engine <a href="http://mahalo.com">Mahalo</a>, but still a valid point. Now
his entire business model was kind of validated by Google moving into the exact same space, getting people to write special pages about a certain subject. The important thing behind it is that the author of the page is personally identifiable, meaning that that person will have a hard time spamming. It will be interesting to see what the reaction of Jason will be to this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>John Battelle <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/004150.php">posted a great list of questions</a> posed to Google by Rep. Joe Barton in relation to the Google DoubleClick buy. By now, people are <a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2007/12/googleclick-inquiry-microsoft-lobbyists-get-to-rep-barton.html">speculating</a> if Microsoft didn&#8217;t help with these questions, especially because they are really questions all of us would like an answer to. Here are just some of the questions:</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;4.    Please explain how Google uses the information or data described in Question 1(a) - (1), or any additional data, to drive or target advertisements to individual users&#8217; computers.   &lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>Those 1(a) to (1) include stuff like your web history, picasa usage, desktop search, &#8230; :)</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;5.    In particular, please explain whether Google Maps directs advertisements to IP addresses based on that user&#8217;s Google Maps search query history.  &lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>So if you search for San Francisco, do they presume your IP is from there?</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;10.   Please explain whether Google posts a link to its privacy policy on the home page or search results page of www.google.com and, if not, explain why not.  &lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>In short: why not? :)</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;11.   In Google&#8217;s privacy policy, &quot;personal information&quot; is defined as &quot;information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information by Google.&quot;     &lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;  a.  Please describe how Google interprets &quot;reasonably linked.&quot;
b.  Please explain in what circumstances Google links information
such that an individual can be identified.
c.  Please explain whether Google considers an IP address to be &quot;personal information.&quot;
d.  Please explain whether technology exists to personally identify or determine the personal characteristics, including, but not limited to, name, email address, physical address or location, age, gender, or ethnicity of an Internet user based on that user&#8217;s IP address.
e.  Please explain whether Google is capable of identifying or determining personal characteristics, including, but not limited to, name, email address, physical address or location, age, gender, or ethnicity of an Internet user based on that user&#8217;s IP address.        &lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>Hard questions these are, especially because Google will probably not want to give that answer :)</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;a.    If Google does not intend to merge or combine the data Google retains with the information or data retained or collected by DoubleClick, please describe the efficiencies of the Google-DoubleClick merger.          b. If Google does not intend to merge or combine the data Google retains with the information or data retained or collected by DoubleClick, please explain how the information will be segregated.          &lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>ohoh :)</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;24.   The House passed the Securely Protect Yourself Against Cyber Trespass (SPY ACT) in the current and prior two Congresses.  The SPY ACT, H.R. 964, sponsored by Representatives Mary Bono and Adolphus Towns, mandates an opt-in privacy regime by prohibiting the collection of personal information from a computer without a user&#8217;s notice and consent prior to the execution of any information collection program. H.R. 964 also demands that a user be able to easily remove or disable the information collection program.  Please explain whether Google&#8217;s applications are subject to H.R. 964&#8217;s consent requirements.  If the answer is no, please explain why these programs, which collect personal information, are not subject to the consent regime established by H.R. 964. &lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>boy oh boy :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found this one via <a href="http://plentyoffish.wordpress.com/2007/12/13/the-next-huge-site/">Paradigm Shift</a>, check it out: <a href="http://freerice.com/">FreeRice</a>. It&#8217;s a simple concept. For every question you answer right, they get a page view and you kind of give (via them) 20 grains of rice. They pay for that via advertising. I needed to dig a little deeper into their numbers:
&lt;ol&gt;</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;One grain of rice weighs about 20-30mg.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;20 grains of rice weigh about  0.6g&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;you need over 1660 plays on the site to play 1kg of rice&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;if I have found it correctly, [one tonne of rice](http://www.guardian.co.uk/feedarticle?id=7149821) costs roughly $340, so one kg about $0.34&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;they need a cpm of 20 cents to come out even if they can buy wholesale.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;based on their [stats](http://freerice.com/totals.html) they gave  8,294,816,130 grains of rice, so&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;414,740,806 hits on the site or 20 grain portions, however you want to see it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Based on the 1660 plays above for a kg of rice,&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;they gave away roughly 250 tons of rice already&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
</code></pre>

<p>&lt;/ol&gt;
Not bad for a site that is only for just a little time. Let&#8217;s hope they do what they do :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Fun things happening on the porn front. I&#8217;ll try to summarize and extend <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/100035">this heise.de article</a> which goes into detail on what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, Arcor, a german ISP, started blocking YouPorn because of a court order. The problem is that in germany porn sites need to do age validation to keep the kids out, which is all fine and good. We all know though, if you want porn, you can get it. One of those sources might be YouPorn which asks you via a simple button if you are over 18. Slowly all hell broke loose in the porn world, especially because what this does, is give an example on future cases that are similar. That would mean that any site running in a foreign country that does not adhere to German law can and needs to be blocked. Some say it seems a bit like the Chinese firewall. :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Well now the case just got a bit more interesting because on German company now sued Arcor to block Google, because you can get endless porn with the right searches, especially on Google Images, including searches that will give you animal porn, all but illegal in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In general the company giving the service to access the internet, needs to, when notified, block the offending site/page. This site in this case is Google and I would not be too surprised if Arcor is actually happy about the request to block Google. Who better to have on your side than Google in this case.  Theoretically any site in Germany actually needs an &quot;Impressum&quot;, a small part where it becomes clear who is running the site with their full address. As foreign sites often do not have that, a provider might have to block all of them.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;ll be fun to see how this turns out because I am pretty sure that Arcor does not want to block Google, and Google doesn&#8217;t want that either. :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Update: <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/100530/">Heise reports</a> the first verdict is out. Arcor doesn&#8217;t have to block Google. It seems that Arcor isn&#8217;t the cause of it, they don&#8217;t make money with it, and it is hard to block. The same thing now applies to YouPorn and others, which was the entire point of the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s not all art, there is a lot of science to it, or so it seems. Check out this very well commented post on Techcrunch called <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/22/the-secret-strategies-behind-many-viral-videos/">The Secret Strategies Behind Many Viral Videos</a>. So you think all of the top videos are there by accident? If you take a look at the <a href="http://youtube.com/browse?s=mp&amp;amp;t=a&amp;amp;c=0&amp;amp;l=">most viewed videos all time</a> there are a lot of brand videos on there for my taste. This made me wonder a few days ago how this happens and the article seems to be a good pointer.</p>

<p>In general, it&#8217;s simple. You spam, a quasi legal way. You have several youtube accounts and comment around, you post on forums, pay bloggers to post a video, use 5000-friends-accounts on facebook to distribute the video, &#8230; stuff like that. If the video then has a few qualities that the post talks about, you might have yourself a viral video. Congratulations :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I now have this wonderful bit in my newsstream at Facebook.</p>

<p>All in all, too flashy, too annoying but the worse thing is the targeting. I AM IN GERMANY!!! And Facebook knows that. Facebook even knows the city. They also know I have an MBA with a focus on among others Finance.</p>

<p>I have nothing against ads, hell I am in the ads business, making local merchants more successful through <a href="https://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a>, but emmm&#8230; this is so un-targeted it is annoying and it is 100% not what Facebook is talking about and where the value is supposed to be. It&#8217;s a standard UK Lead Gen business that is advertising for conversions. Really wonderful how they are doing. Clicks will likely be high, but Facebook has an advertiser there that tracks it&#8217;s campaign very well so we will see how it goes.</p>
