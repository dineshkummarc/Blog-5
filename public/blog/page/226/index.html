  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;I&gt;Posted by Donald Luskin 5:33 PM
Thought for the weekend. I&#8217;ve gotten this via email from several friends and readers: If you bought $1,000 worth of Nortel stock one year ago, it would now be worth $49. If you bought $1,000 worth of Budweiser (the beer, not the stock) one year ago, drank all the beer, and traded in the cans for the nickel deposit, you would have $79. My advice to you is to start drinking heavily.
&lt;/I&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So what situation are we in? Here is a suggestion:</p>

<p>(the first part)</p>

<p>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;
The Prisoners&#8217; Dilemma&lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>Cooperation is usually analysed in game theory by means of a non-zero-sum game called the &quot;Prisoner&#8217;s Dilemma&quot; (Axelrod, 1984). The two players in the game can choose between two moves, either &quot;cooperate&quot; or &quot;defect&quot;. The idea is that each player gains when both cooperate, but if only one of them cooperates, the other one, who defects, will gain more. If both defect, both lose (or gain very little) but not as much as the &quot;cheated&quot; cooperator whose cooperation is not returned. &lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>These are from last year by the way.</p>

<p>An interesting read ;)</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;&quot;Mars is essentially in the same orbit&#8230;Mars is somewhat the same distance from the Sun, which is very important. We have seen pictures where there are canals, we believe, and water. If there is water, that means there is oxygen. If oxygen, that means we can breathe.&quot;
&#8230;Governor George W. Bush, Jr., 8/11/94</p>

<p>&quot;I believe we are on an irreversible trend toward more freedom and democracy - but that could change.&quot;
&#8230;Governor George W. Bush, Jr., 5/22/98</p>

<p>&quot;One word sums up probably the responsibility of any Governor, and that one word is &#8216;to be prepared&#8217;.&quot;
&#8230;Governor George W. Bush, Jr., 12/6/93</p>

<p>&quot;Verbosity leads to unclear, inarticulate things.&quot;
&#8230;Governor George W. Bush, Jr., 11/30/96</p>

<p>I have made good judgments in the past. I have made good judgments in the future.&quot;

<p>&quot;A low voter turnout is an indication of fewer people going to the polls.&quot;

<p>&quot;Illegitimacy is something we should talk about in terms of not having it.&quot;
&#8230;Governor George W. Bush, Jr., 5/20/96</p>

<p>&quot;We are ready for any unforeseen event that may or may not occur.&quot;
&#8230;Governor George W. Bush, Jr., 9/22/97</p>

<p>For NASA, space is still a high priority.&quot;
&#8230;Governor George W. Bush, Jr., 9/5/93</p>

<p>&quot;We have a firm commitment to NATO, we are a part of NATO. We have a firm commitment to Europe. We are a part of Europe.&quot;
&#8230;Governor George W. Bush, Jr.</p>

<p>&quot;I have been asked who caused the riots and the killing in LA, my answer has been direct &amp; simple: Who is to blame for the riots? The rioters are to blame. Who is to blame for the killings? The killers are to blame.&quot;
&#8230;George W. Bush, Jr.</p>

<p>&quot;The Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation&#8217;s history. I mean in this century&#8217;s history. But we all lived in this century. I didn&#8217;t live in this century.&quot;

<p>&quot;Quite frankly, teachers are the only profession that teach our children.&quot;

<p>&quot;The American people would not want to know of any misquotes that George Bush may or may not make.&quot;

<p>&quot;It isn&#8217;t pollution that&#8217;s harming the environment. It&#8217;s the impurities in our air and water that are doing it.&quot;

<p>&lt;I&gt;THE WIT &amp; WISDOM OF GEORGE W. BUSH. All Quotes 100% Authentic:</p>

<p>&quot;I think we can agree. The past is over&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have learned from mistakes I may or may not have made.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was raised in the West. The west of Texas. It&#8217;s pretty close to California. In more ways than Washington, D.C., is close to California.&quot;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Terror feeds on Anger. Anger feeds on Poverty. At least partly. And I think poverty is a huge part on the climat in Afghanistan. So what if we were to send in billions of dollars of medicine, food, any non-military help? With a UN/US sticker and flag on all the packages and products to show people that we care for their suffering and that the US and the world is not trying to kill them all.</p>

<p>The thing is that lack of information is another of the big problems. These people just have no idea what the western world is really like. If our actions lead to more suffering and poverty then the anger and terror will only grow.</p>

<p>The challenge would be to do this but try to still hold those who did this responsible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(taken from: http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=15754834)</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;With sadness, I watch and listen as mothers and fathers hold the terrorists up as role models for their children.</p>

<p>I spoke with four children under the age of 10 yesterday. Three of the children told me that they were going to find the bad guys and kill them&#8230;I do believe that our country has just been the victim of children who felt the same way.</p>

<p>The fourth little guy is the one that gave me hope. As he sat in front of the television, watching the continuous reporting of death and destruction and suffering, he spoke the wisest words I had heard all day.</p>

<p>As Austin watched, he said very quietly and to no one in particular, &quot;I think those guys are dumb.&quot;</p>

<p>If little Osama&#8217;s parents and religious teachers had taught him more about dumb and less about anger and violence, Tuesday would have been just another sunny day in New York.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I seriously believe that you can only make up your own mind if you try to get the widest picture possible. All media is biased in some way and the wider the picture you get, the less biased your own opinion will be.</p>

<p>The following article, which might be said to be anti-american by some, is talking about the rejoicing of Palestinians that is seen on the TV and tries to give a few comments on a) what was seen there, b) what might have been behind those cheers.</p>

<p>http://electronicintifada.net/coveragetrends/rejoicing.html</p>

<p>A few quotes:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;Whatever a group of 20-40 Palestinian children happened to be doing yesterday morning in Nablus or Ein Al-Hilweh Refugee Camp in Lebanon is no more representative of all Palestinians than the Klu Klux Klan rally &#8211; which happened recently just down the road from where I live, in St. Paul, Minnesota &#8211; is representative of all Americans.</p>

<p>[&#8230;]</p>

<p>That Israel has used &quot;excessive force&quot; to suppress the current Palestinian uprising against 34 years of its military occupation is a fact according to the United Nations Security Council, other UN bodies, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Israeli human rights organisation B&#8217;Tselem, and the US State Department. However offensive the images of the small groups of Palestinians that were celebrating may be, the fact is that all those depicted in the images &#8211; if they are under 34 years of age &#8211; have known nothing but military occupation for the entirity of their lives.</p>

<p>[&#8230;]</p>

<p>A current figure for U.S. aid currently given to Israel is $3 billion per year, which includes $1.2 billion in economic aid and $1.8 billion in military aid.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The full post can be found here: http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=15746682</p>

<p>For some short quotes to give you an idea:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;[&#8230;]</p>

<p>We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone
Age. Trouble is, that&#8217;s been done. The Soviets took care of it
already. Make the Afghans suffer? They&#8217;re already suffering. Level
their houses? Done. Turn their schools into piles of rubble? Done.
Eradicate their hospitals? Done. Destroy their infrastructure? Cut
them off from medicine and health care? Too late. Someone already
did all that.</p>

<p>[&#8230;]</p>

<p>We&#8217;re flirting with a world war between
Islam and the West.</p>

<p>And guess what: that&#8217;s Bin Laden&#8217;s program. That&#8217;s exactly what he
wants. That&#8217;s why he did this. Read his speeches and statements.
It&#8217;s all right there. He really believes Islam would beat the west. It
might seem ridiculous, but he figures if he can polarize the world
into Islam and the West, he&#8217;s got a billion soldiers. If the west
wreaks a holocaust in those lands, that&#8217;s a billion people with
nothing left to lose, that&#8217;s even better from Bin Laden&#8217;s point of
view. He&#8217;s probably wrong, in the end the west would win, whatever
that would mean, but the war would last for years and millions would
die, not just theirs but ours. Who has the belly for that? Bin Laden
does. Anyone else?
&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>And it also talks about the fact that the URI (the United Religions Initiative) is based on the principles of the Chaordic Organisation which is an amazingly powerful concept.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had some talks with friends again recently and some things came up that even though simple, are worth really thinking about.</p>

<p>First of all, this is really not a normal war. We have to be very clear about that. Most other wars have been about land and this is about belief, nothing else. And the most dangerous thing is that at least one side of this war has no problem whatsoever of dying for their cause. They believe in their cause. With all their heart and mind. They will not stop until their last heart beat. This is not to say that everybody needs to be killed but just that this does not have a clear line of where it is over. You can&#8217;t say: &quot;Well, they are out of Kuweit now and we just have to pay attention that they don&#8217;t get in again.&quot; They are spread all over the world with the belief that until their goal is reached they will die for achieving it. Very very very scary.</p>

<p>The second thing is that if this will result in a war, a real war, then this will most likely be a war in Europe. They are spread all over the world but Europe is just the closest. Think about that.</p>
