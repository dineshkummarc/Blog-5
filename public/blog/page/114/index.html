  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here the look goes into the overall methods and frameworks within which techniques can be deployed. In general you are working to come from confusion to clarity. This can just happen because you let it, you can make it happen or you can help it happen. It&#8217;s hard to classify the different methods that can be used because they are evolving. All this goes back to Socrates (400BC). Slowly ideas were written down and with it problem solving techniques. Now lots of the techniques have matured. Some are even old and might be replaced or improved.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>A little look at history follows as the methods emerge. In the 30s to 50s Alex Osborn and William J.J. Gordon introduced the idea of brainstorming, splitting up fact-finding, idea-finding and solution-finding. System thinkers were also starting at the same time, and they saw problem solving as a technical and rational process: define, identify, develop, analyse and recommend. Overall, both where saying that you need to clarify the problem, then think up possibilities and go to selecting the best.</p>

<p>In the 60s and 70s we were moving on. The real problems were wicked. Since you can&#8217;t agree on the problem, the above methods stop to work. One option was to tweak the old method, with lots of itterations, entry and exit points, generating problems from answers and in general diverging and converging in lots and lots of phases. There is a good and long figure on page 133 about this.</p>

<p>At this time, Synectics was born, which talked about opening up the problem to find numerous solutions, through springboards for example.</p>

<p>Colin Eden&#8217;s SODA even went one step further, not only avoiding the problem definition but also avoiding the need for ideas. Just create a map that everyone agrees with, and then go from there. Causal mapping is something you can use here.</p>

<p>Mason and Mitroff&#8217;s Dialectical approaches are another option, which is about going into discussion in a controlled way with a clear thesis and antithesis. You need to be aware to manage the conflict and have a good antithesis though for this to work well.</p>

<p>Checkland&#8217;s soft systems method (SSM) is about orchestrating debate, as teh book puts it. Here you just take more alternatives than with Dialectics, which is about two people discussing it.</p>

<p>Friend and Hickling&#8217;s strategic choice approach is about mapping all the options, seeing uncertainties, removing the immpossible ones and continuing this to choose.</p>

<p>Next to looking for the problem, &lt;b&gt;facilitation&lt;/b&gt; was a real concern. You can either get a person that knows what she is doing or make the methods easy enough to do. Nominal Group Technique (NGT) and Brainwriting are easy enough to use methods for example.</p>

<p>Also important: &lt;b&gt;incorporating the non-rational&lt;/b&gt;: This got growing attention, with logic being seen as a special way of thinking. This became more acceptable as a view point in the 60s and 70s. The intuitive was more plausible, but was still routed in the clarify, think, select approach. But maybe the solution was already inside you. Emotional intelligence (Goleman) is important in this respect.</p>

<p>Some techniques here are NLP for example, neuro-linguistic programming. It helps you to become more skilled at reading yourself.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Maturity and the Future&lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>The 80s and 90s can be called maturity. Here we are repackaging and finding new paradigms. Methods are put together to form new things, adapted to special areas, software used to improve them or exploit them. The role of IT and more importance of other kinds of thinking need to be mentioned. We are starting to understand the brain better but this understanding hasn&#8217;t even started yet. Post-modernism is about the notion that there might be lots of possible approaches and agreement is more about negotiation than about objective proof.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Future Trends&lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>Maybe all of this will go to the mass user market, help busy managers by being extremely easy and swift to use, it developments might help to further them, or consultants will drive new methods to make money. There are numerous possible scenarios.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Frameworks&lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>There are different ones that are brought forward here.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;Framework 1&lt;/i&gt; Problem solving as answering
&lt;i&gt;Framework 2&lt;/i&gt; Problem solving as searching
&lt;i&gt;Framework 3&lt;/i&gt; Problem solving as cultivation
&lt;i&gt;Framework 4&lt;/i&gt; Problem solving as mapping
&lt;i&gt;Framework 5&lt;/i&gt; Problem solving as debate
&lt;i&gt;Framework 6&lt;/i&gt; Problem solving as reperception</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;(comment: As originally posted on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of different techniques you can use, and some ordering is needed. For the OUBS this is done with 12 precepts as a framework. These can be grouped together further in terms of their giving a sense of direction, or being part of Handy&#8217;s creative climate (Curiosity, Forgiveness, Love). Underpinning all of this is Schon&#8217;s idea of the &quot;reflective practitioner&quot;, meaning somebody that goes into deep double-loop learning.
I&#8217;ll now give a very short overview over these. While they are easy to grasp as a first step. Most of them have some deeper meaning that needs some thinking on your part. I highly suggest taking each part and think about what this really means for you, potentially going back to the book to get some insight.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curiosity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Precept 1: Adopt a &#8216;set to break sets&#8217;&lt;/em&gt;: Think different, get people that think different, take different perspective, different different different&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Precept 2: Explore the &#8216;givens&#8217;&lt;/em&gt;: Context is important for a problem. Maybe the context was wrong. Use Assumption surfacing or Reversals to get behind it. Get a fresh view on it. Try being very clear about your environment, trying to notice things you take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Precept 3: Broad picture, local detail&lt;/em&gt;: You can store an enormous amount of information, but only very few items at a time. Use mind maps or similar techniques to go broad and deep at the same time or rather one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Precept 4: Value play&lt;/em&gt;: Play is central to learning, just think about being a kid. You learn by trial and error. It loosens things up if you can just play with a problem. For this you need to create a special settings, choose team members that trust each other and you can simply use such techniques as a way to build a team.
&lt;em&gt;Precept 5: Build up, don&#8217;t knock down&lt;/em&gt;: Go from &#8216;Yes, but&#8230;&#8217; to &#8216;Yes, and&#8230;&#8217;. Value people.
&lt;em&gt;Precept 6: Live with Looseness&lt;/em&gt;: Things will be confusing, uncertain, contradictory, sceptical and more. Especially in whicked problems you need to live with it and let go to have a map built over time.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Precept 7: It is there already - nurture it&lt;/em&gt;: Creativity is probably already there, well below its potential. Try removing soem barriers. Delegate, make ideas welcome, schedule idea time.
&lt;em&gt;Precept 8: Involve others&lt;/em&gt;: We all have different view, and something normal for us might not be for somebody else. New ideas come from this. Enjoy the differences.
&lt;em&gt;Precept 9: Connect and be receptive&lt;/em&gt;: ideas can be triggered from your environment. These can be related to the problem or not. You need to link problems and triggers.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A sense of direction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Precept 10: Know what you really want&lt;/em&gt;: As they say &quot;if you don&#8217;t know where you want to go, you probably won&#8217;t get there&quot;. The way is not important, or rather needs to be loose, but the goal should be clear.
&lt;em&gt;Precept 11: Cycle often and close late&lt;/em&gt;: Try not to appear decisive, or stop at the first solution. Cycle a few times to allow extra deeper information to filter in.
&lt;em&gt;Precept 12: Manage the process&lt;/em&gt;: People, Place and Process. These are important and should be managed.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being a reflective practitioner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep creativity and analysis apart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand what you are doing and why&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn from the experience of others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There is a nice checklist on page 113 of the book for self-evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finished reading <a href="http://www.changethis.com/2.ThisIBelieve">This I Believe!</a> by Tom Peters and boy do I love it. I actually already ordered Re-Imagine!, after it having been suggested to me by <a href="http://bornholz.typepad.com/">Ingmar</a> about a week back and after having read the manifesto. Read to to find out what I felt were the most touching points for me.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Audacity matters&lt;/b&gt; is point number 2, was actually already part of Built-To-Last, where BHAG was coined. &lt;b&gt;Question authority&lt;/b&gt; is about hireing disrespectful people. &lt;I&gt;&quot;No Assumption should go unchallenged!&quot;&lt;/i&gt; and that &lt;i&gt;&quot;Gold Stars for all who openly challenge the status quo - day after day after daunting day.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; are Tom&#8217;s main points here and they really hit home. &lt;b&gt;Disorganization wins&lt;/b&gt;, but not undiscipline is very close to trust and to what Semco does I find. &lt;I&gt;&quot;They [good managers] know that what they know is small beer compared to what they don&#8217;t know.&quot;&lt;/I&gt; Here he splits organization which is about executing the daily chores and progress, which &lt;i&gt;depends on counterintuitive leaps into the unknown&lt;/i&gt;.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Three hearty cheers for weirdos&lt;/b&gt; is something that goes through the entire thing, making sure that you understand that different is good. I also agree 100% with his point 8, that technology change is but in its infancy. Everything is up for graps (9). &lt;i&gt;&quot;It is the foremost rask - and responsibilty - of this generation to re-imagine all of our institutions, private and public.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; is very similar to what Dee Hock said in Birth of the Chaordic Age:</p>

<p>&lt;i&gt;In times such as these, it is no failure to fall short of realizing all that we might dream - the failure is to fall short of dreaming all that we might realize. We must try. - Dee Hock&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>In point 10, Tom argues that &lt;i&gt;Upstarts will indeed become Establishment&lt;/i&gt;. His &lt;i&gt;money lies with the next generation(s) of Gateses and Waltons and Venters&lt;/i&gt;. These companies shoudl really focus on temporary glory, things that may not last but the will change the world permanently.</p>

<p>Kaizen (Continuous Improvement) is something he says is dangerous. To some extent I agree, especially with his point that it perfection gets in the way of finding the next big thing if you only focus on it. A nice quote there comes from Nichalos Negroponte: &lt;i&gt;Incrementalism is innovation&#8217;s worst enemy&lt;/i&gt;. If you are starting to get too comfortable, destruct! &lt;i&gt; A little (or more) boat burning would do many enterprises a world of good.&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>I really liked seeing Tom quote Dee Hock who said something very important (again): &lt;I&gt;The problem is never how to get new, innovative thoughts into your mind, but how to get the old ones out.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Boring begets boring&lt;/b&gt; &#8230; &lt;i&gt;If we force ourselves into constant contact with Cool &#8230; the odds are (sky) high that &quot;cool&quot; will rub off.&lt;/i&gt; Cool :) He goes further though, which puts this a bit into perspective and makes it harder: &lt;I&gt;This [disagreeing] is so central to personal growth (mine, at least) that I deliberatly micro-manage my calendar to ensure sufficient contact with&#8230; people and groups that &#8230; terrify &#8230; me.&lt;/I&gt; Now go out and do that. I put it on my calendar. :)</p>

<p>Another great point (ok, they all are, but one that I liked, maybe because I am like that ;)) &lt;B&gt;Action &#8230; ALWAYS&#8230; takes precedence.&lt;/B&gt; [&#8230;] &lt;I&gt;Do&#8230;NOW. Think&#8230;later. At the very least, you&#8217;ll have something to think about since you&#8217;ve just done&#8230;something.&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>In the space in marketing I work in this here rang amazingly true: &lt;I&gt;Plans do not make the world go &#8216;round. What does? Demos! Heroes! Stories! Tests! Palpable examples! Experiments! Prototypes!&lt;/i&gt; Here he also quotes Bob Stone: &lt;I&gt;Some people look for things that went wrong and try to fix them. I look for things that went right and try to build off them.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>I love his writing style. Period. End here. Example: &lt;I&gt;Failure is the mother (father, and uncle) of success. (Period.)&lt;/I&gt; Did that get the point across? :)</p>

<p>Some quotes for that one (rather the next point but its similar):
1. David Kelly: &lt;I&gt;Fail Faster. Succeed sooner.&lt;/I&gt;
2. Executive: &lt;I&gt;Fail. Forward. Fast.&lt;/I&gt;
3. Phil Daniels: &lt;I&gt;Reward excellent failures. Punish mediocre successes.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Then something scary, for us men. &lt;b&gt;S-H-E is the best leader&lt;/b&gt; &lt;I&gt;Women will rule. (Period.)&lt;/I&gt; Here he also cites the trend that there are two trends worth trillions. Women buy all the Stuff and We&#8217;re getting older. Oh so true.</p>

<p>Then something that will make some of my friends very happy: The next value proposition is design. Very good point. But then he goes on to say that Branding is for everyone and if it is what he says it is, which is to connect stories and myths to a company (because information and intelligence is not something that connects people anymore, in a time when machines have this) then I can buy into it. It also means that blogging will gain in power even more.</p>

<p>Then something about founding a company. &lt;B&gt;What matters is &#8230; Stuff That Matters&lt;/B&gt;, meaning that you don&#8217;t create a business but a cause.</p>

<p>Going back to technology, check this: &lt;I&gt;The IS/IT/Web Revolution&#8230; again: in its infancy&#8230;changes&#8230; POSITIVELY EVERYTHING.&lt;/I&gt; AGREED AGREED AGREED!!! :)</p>

<p>Stop doing dumb stuff, his 40th point, is actually very similar to Seth Godin&#8217;s <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/08/do_less.html">Do Less</a>.</p>

<p>Then something important: &lt;B&gt;Take charge of your destiny. (No option.) It is a Brand New, Brand You World.&lt;/b&gt; Yes, you have to build your own personal brand.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;1. I am known for [two to three things]
next year at this time I&#8217;ll be known for [one more thing].
2. My current project is challenging me in the following [two ways].
3. New things I&#8217;ve learned in the lasst 90 days include [two items].
4. My public &quot;recognition program&quot; consists of [one item].
5. Important additions to my Rolodex in the last 90 days include [one to two names].
6. My resume is &#8230; discernebly different&#8230; from last year&#8217; at this time [in one or two ways].
&lt;/I&gt;
Great list. I&#8217;ll try to add this to my time planner. &lt;I&gt;Bottom line: You are a damn fool if you don&#8217;t assume that 36 months from now you&#8217;ll be looking for a job.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Point 49 (I left out some here ;)) concludes: &lt;I&gt;Sales for breakfast! Sales for lunch! Sales for dinner! And dream about Sales as you sleep!&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Now something for all your managers out there: &lt;B&gt;Management Rule/Role No. 1: GET THE HELL OUT OF THE WAY.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;I&gt;&quot;Manager&quot; = Hurdle Removal Professional&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>As Peter Drucker said: &lt;I&gt;Ninety percent of what we call &#8216;management&#8217; consists of making it difficult for people to get things done.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>One important thing in working with people: &lt;B&gt;Respect&lt;/B&gt;. Put differently: &lt;I&gt;Don&#8217;t Belittle&lt;/I&gt;. Add to that: &lt;I&gt;The deepest human need is the need to be appreciated.&lt;/I&gt; - William James, psychologist</p>

<p>Now go DO STUFF! :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am not sure if I really want to be doing this but it&#8217;s a good experiment. I now publish my own <a href="http://www.rsscalendar.com/">RSSCalendar.com</a> on <a href="http://oliver.thylmann.com/">oliver.thylmann.com</a>, which is starting to become a real portal to my world. Is it good that people know where I am? Is it not? Will it be interesting? Will some meetings come out of it. We will see. It&#8217;s a great addition to the interconnectedness of all things. Thanks a lot to John for continuing to be some great additions to the service, as for example the option of a roling 30 days feeds which just gives you a view of the next 30 days of my life&#8230; well, there is a lot more to my life but that&#8217;s the stuff I think is fun to share. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago, Thijs post about why <a href="http://blog.taospace.com/2004/08/why_i_hate_ente.html">he hates &quot;Enterprise Software&quot;</a> and has some very good points. These things are getting awfully complex because they want to be everything for everyone. In this light, reading Jonathan Schwartz&#8217;s post on the question <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/20040825#who_picked_your_search_engine1">&lt;i&gt;&quot;Who chose your Search Engine?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;</a> is an interesting one. Jonathan argues that while CIOs have built themselves an empire, deciding which software goes where (and in the process needing to have a 3CD Oracle install to support everyone, see Thijs&#8217; post), this is coming to an end. You are starting to choose which kind of software you use for what. At least this is true for the search engine you use. It is also true for the mobile phone you use at work, for many at least. You might also want to have an IM client on your desktop that has your friends in it. Companies like Semco even allow you to buy your own hardware and decide what you need, not even having somebody in charge of the IT systems.</p>

<p>Mixing an matching all of this, I am wondering if through the power of WebServices you might be building upon existing web sites and translate them into the enterprise. Just do all your purchasing through eBay, limiting buys to &quot;Buy Now&quot; and high ratings for the seller. Store your images for design purposes on Flickr.com. Do you booking via an open API of some booking agency. In this scenario, those who haven open and documented APIs will win in the long run because once connected, you are unlikely to change. It will also do away with making most stuff internally. Maybe the ASP model will get a revival. Not sure yet. But I am thinking.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: As often Thijs has explained all of this a lot better than I did or could. <a href="http://blog.taospace.com/2004/08/the_rebellion_w.html">Check it out</a>! Thanks Thijs!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230; it&#8217;s currently falling down on me. I have just clipped tons of posts that all are more interesting than the next, all talking about &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what is on my mind, needing to be put into context. Affiliate Networks, AdSense, Marketing, Permission, Branding, APIs, WebServices, Connectedness, Blogging, Interconnectedness, Networks, Collaboration, Chaord, Semler, &#8230;</p>

<p>Sometimes it just feels too much but boy is the opportunity big. Sometimes this stuff just baffles me. Now I will need to let the feeds go and concentrate on the urgent, as much as I would love to focus on the important. But i need to keep my brain from bursting. More on all this later, no worries I&#8217;m fine, just a bit on synaps overload ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So this will be the first <a href="http://www.changethis.com/">ChangeThis</a> manifesto that I will like to. Seth Godin&#8217;s <a href="http://www.changethis.com/2.DoLess">Do Less</a>. First of all it is a very nice and short read and it is true. &lt;i&gt;Big doesn&#8217;t equal successful&lt;/I&gt;, at elast in many cases. Is your business really about volume? Volume in clients? Do you need more people or just less negative-EVA projects? We moved from huge factories to projects but do we really putthe same power into analysing which projects we do in relation to how we analyse which factories to build and run? Sure, projects are often smaller beasts, but it remains true. &lt;i&gt;We can&#8217;t have everything.&lt;/i&gt; Leaving out the worst bits improves profitability and our life! The only problem with this is that we often don&#8217;t know which projects will turn out to be the most profitable beforehand. In this case we probably have to take the leap and kill the early. Start, Test, Measure, Stop, Optimize, Test, Measure, Stop. Cancel or go on from there. And no, that&#8217;s not as easy as it sounds. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://sapventures.typepad.com/">Jeff</a> has a very nice post entitled <a href="http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2004/08/information_for.html">Information Force Multiplier</a> on his blog. He quotes an interview with General Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, from which he deducts an interesting idea. CEOs want and need to know what is happening at the front line, but often when just asking around, it&#8217;s hard to get to the heart of the matter in a reasonable amount of time, due to boundaries of trust to name just one example. Of course you should establish trust and all that but another interesting idea for blogging is that you not only aggregate the blogs, but you also summarize it, get out the basic concepts behind it. If 20 people talk about the same thing I don&#8217;t need to read all of their posts but I could see the overall idea they point to.</p>

<p>Maybe Apple&#8217;s Summary mechanism might already work here somehow. I just summed up Jeff&#8217;s post with it and it came out very nicely.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;I think, you know, when you get to the four-star level, you fight to get information from the troops and you donâ€™t want to be a victim of just getting fed what the staff brings you every day.</p>

<p>&#8230;Of course, this isn&#8217;t an entirely efficient process for an executive who probably already has too much on his/her plate, so the opportunity that exists from a tech standpoint is to aggregate blogs and apply BI techniques to sort, categorize, and apply qualitative filters to.&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>There you go. As he says, that might be what Feedster and Technorati might also be up to. This would make the $12 million valuation for Technorati too low in my oppinion, but we will see.</p>
