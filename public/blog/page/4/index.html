  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of rage about the new TOS from Facebook. In short, it gives all the rights (and I mean all of them) of what you share in Facebook (and what is connected to it it seems) to Facebook. With the new terms, this is even true if you delete things or your account. Mark now <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=54434097130">posted on the Facebook blog with a few words about the TOS</a> but I am not really happy. He says that &quot;&lt;em&gt;In reality, we wouldn&#8217;t share your information in a way you wouldn&#8217;t want.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; and that is just plain wonderful. But please, reflect that in the TOS and get your lawyers in line. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I can see how the TOS came about. The lawyers asked several people what they want to do with the content and started writing. Then they asked whether they might ever use it for advertising, and people said that sure, there might be something they could do there. Would they use it after the account was deleted, sure, for mining the data would be nice and my friends still have my mails via Facebook. And in all those things go. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Duncan from The Inquisitor actually has a <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/18225/word-of-advice-get-your-blog-content-off-facebook-asap/">great post about all of this</a>. The good thing is that he copied over the TOS from Google&#8217;s Picasa and who would have thought, the Google Lawyers managed to write something up that makes sure I remain holder of the copyright and I remain in control. And I am pretty sure that Google would be able to do anything with my content if they really wanted to, unless I delete it. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Come on Mark, you can do better than Google. Sure it makes the TOS more complicated and sure, you need to add some limits to your system, but this is what the users want.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;The bloggerati are slowly becoming the twitterati and if you ask the right people love for Twitter is all around you. For those of us who use Twitter daily, or like me have secured themselves a one letter Twitter nick (<a href="http://twitter.com/o">o</a>), we are seeing that it becomes a lot more of our social network than a emm&#8230; social network.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I actually still believe things like Xing or LinkedIn should focus on <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2009/01/11/getting-that-damn-address-book-in-sync/">syncing my addressbook</a>, instead of life streams and all else. And the power of Twitter is that there are <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2009/01/16/please-no-conversations-on-twitter/">no conversations</a> of a meaningful extent. And now the blogosphere is alight with recent news. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;First of all Facebook joined the OpenID Foundation, allowing your Facebook Login to be used on other sites, which <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/why_facebook_openid_good.php">RWW thinks is wonderful news</a>. I tend to agree and think it is a good first step in the right direction. It is still problematic that my content is locked in in Facebook. I use my mails on my own personal domain for the same reason. Still, Facebook is good and good is getting better.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The Facebook posted <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;amp;story=193">news of a new API to allow access to among others status items</a> &#8230; the twitter like stuff within Facebook. So L<a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2009/02/facebook-launches-his-own-twitter-and-opens-status-api.html">oic thinks they now compete directly with Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.allfacebook.com/2009/02/facebook-opens-status-api-say-goodbye-to-twitter/">AllFacebook already says goodbye to Twitter</a>. TheNextWeb thinks <a href="http://thenextweb.com/2009/02/07/facebook-status-updates-public-huge/">it is huge</a>, and <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_opens_up_lets_develop.php">RWW has a nice little summary and more numbers</a> and has one very good point.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Facebook is tearing down the wall. It is not trying to become the next Twitter, but it is just giving people what they feel their need to more intimately connect and are now slowly opening up the right APIs. This API is by now very rich, allowing applications to be written the upload status messages, videos, fotos, access status messages of friends, and so on. Slowly but surely Facebook is really moving where you can build a website with Facebook as a platform. If I would now want to do a focused little community I could move my video and photo storage to Facebook, do the messaging and all else.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A few good points on why this will not kill twitter <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/07/why-facebook-isnt-poised-to-steal-twitters-thunder/">can be found here on Techcrunch</a>. In all simpleness, Twitter has a different focus. It&#8217;s really a system to send short messages and not a social network. Facebook is the other way around. Above that, Twitter is messages only and Facebook will tell me everything about my friends.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;As sad as this makes me, it might be that this move allows Facebook to take the Twitter idea mainstream a lot faster than Twitter can. Twitter now has lots of apps around it and Facebook has those apps within Facebook. The problem is who wins and this is where I hope that things will slowly start to change. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There shouldn&#8217;t be the need for anyone to win damn it! I want to send all kinds of messages to all my friends. No matter where they are registered. We are still a bit of time away from this but Facebook opening up more and more and Twitter being fully stable and growing fast, the idea of openness is slowly gaining traction.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Next up I will touch on my personal social store thingie again, in which I am now using <a href="http://noserub.com">Noserub</a> to store and index all my social life at <a href="http://thylmann.net">thylmann.net</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<time datetime="2009-02-08T19:31:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 8<span>th</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;I recently read a (german) <a href="http://www.socialnetworkstrategien.de/2009/01/es-gibt-sie-die-funktionierenden-erlosmodelle-fur-facebook-myspace-studivz-co/">post on potential revenue streams for social networks</a> and I thought I&#8217;d add a few points. Of course there are lots of different ways to make money in social networks, like eCommerce, Premium-Accounts, WOM-Campaigns and more. The big question is really how much money that will be and how will it be managed. Remember, real people don&#8217;t scale, and if you need real people to handle the setup of special marketing projects or account within a social network, then that just doesn&#8217;t scale. That is where the value will really shrink in terms of what people are willing to pay for a social network from the investment side. Facebook is surely not worth billions because they can hire 20.000 people to talk to all the companies out there to set up special accounts on the network and optimize their interaction with their existing and potential customers. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The big point the post makes is that word of mouth marketing will be big in social networks and for those looking a bit behind the scenes of Ormigo, which is still very much in the beginning, we truly believe that this is something very important going forward. The problem is how to monetize it without endangering the relationship you have with your users. You don&#8217;t want a suggestion if you feel the suggesting party is making money by doing so. So saying &quot;tell your friends about your digital TV and I will pay you&quot; will not work. And I really doubt that Facebook will say &quot;if you don&#8217;t pay us the message about buying a digital TV will not appear in the friends stream&quot;&#8230; .&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The valid point is that there is potentially a lot of value to be created by being able to tab into the social network of your users to find out more about them, but we have data oozing out of our ears and we are already not able to fully exploit it because it is so complex to think about or difficult to filter out the meaningful data based on standard models. A lot of times it is just having the right offer that is the hardest. Sure it is nice to know that you had your eyes fixed in a lasik surgery but without an advertiser in the space I cannot really do anything with that information. So I need all advertisers first or a lot of money to get over the dry stretch of not having them.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt that social networks will make money, but based on the conversion rates we are seeing on social networks and on standard content portals, it is just worth A LOT less to advertise there and the content portals are already having problems working profitably. Just being the knot that ties your life together will only lead to immense server costs and not to profits. It will be highly challenging to increase your revenue ten fold through WOM or eCommerce. There is money to be made, sure, but it&#8217;s simply not enough.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;As always I believe in performance advertising and this includes WOM or other forms of advertising with the only real challenge being now to be able to measure it. What gets measured gets done, or so they say. If we find a way to measure these kind of effects that Social Networks will be good at, we can integrate them into our performance advertising measurements and true money will flow in the direction of social networks. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Lots of thinking going down that road I think, so I am looking forward to seeing measurements appear that people really understand and that are valid. An example would be that if I can run an add on Twitter, and it gets Re-Tweeted 100 times, I might pay $100 CPM for displaying that ad the first time, because I have an effective $1 CPM which might be worth-while.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;I love Twitter, hell I even secured myself the wonderful username &quot;<a href="http://twitter.com/o/">o</a>&quot;, which is a naturally scarce username length for those that have not noticed. :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;But that is not what this is about. The thing is that I think there is one relatively simple thing, among others, that makes Twitter so successful: it hinders conversations. I do not mean on a grander scale. It&#8217;s the wonderful enabler for long-term disconnected conversations. Maybe the more correct term for what twitter does not have so much is &lt;i&gt;chatter&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Yes do you have lots of people talking about stuff that might not be interesting to you, but it is your decision who you want to follow and there is an option to even follow a lot of people and still see what is going on. Perhaps those of us who have grown up in IRC times remember that a chat with 200 people was impossible. Thinking about it and comparing it to twitter, it&#8217;s as if you had 2 million people in one chat room but you are only seeing those lines of the people you follow. That models brakes conversations over the entire space in a big way and hence keeps down the volume immensely. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The reason I am bringing it up at this point is that I really hope that Twitter will not put too much emphasis on enabling more conversation to happen. It is already happening but not real chitchat among 5 people and that should be something that should not happen. Imagine somebody asking something and then being able to go into the thread of that question and have a discussion easily by referencing that post. For all people just seeing part of that discussion it is totally useless and making the discussion easy means it will happen. So please people of Twitter, make it hard as it is now. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;And while I am at it, please remove Re-Tweets. I admit, I did it once because it is so much easier to Re-Tweet then to write your own words, but that again is the point. It gets too easy. Twitters goal should not be the highest volume of Tweets by each user, but the long term bonding of relationships. This is where possible value comes from. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So how many people that still tweet more than once a week (fully enough) have an increasing number of friends in both direction? That would be the core user group I&#8217;d say, next to the echo chamber ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;John Battelle has a <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/004781.php">great post</a> with a few ideas about the death of the print industry and journalism.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Go read it and there are some very true points to it. The big problem I see is that journalists have rarely been truly measured as they can be in the internet times. You can write the best article out there, if you do not have a following and do not have something to say that people want to read, it is hard to get a good readership. Then the question only becomes about the importance of your message and somebody pushing you.</p>

<p>The big problem is that journalists were what sold magazines, or so they thought, and they have really good salaries. Really good salaries in some cases. So the newspapers have a big amount of people writing articles, with huge salaries and nobody in their right mind will tell me that my 17 month old sun will get a subscription of the local newspaper delivered to his home each morning, let alone read it.</p>

<p>You can employ all the consultancies that you want to give you the numbers you want to hear, but the problem is that you will not believe it yourself once you think about your own child. My sun might have a kindle like thingie, but not real print I would say.
&lt;p style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;There is no clear way out of this yet, especially because I want good journalism (not highly paid people reprinting AP and Reuters), and online newspapers just do not make the same amount of money as print magazines did.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>The problem is that you really need to understand the needs of the internet and you need to think about what you really are good at. Standard management stuff really and I don&#8217;t buy it that all the big publishers should become investment houses. It will be interesting to follow John in his series of thoughts and I sense a good book coming out of it, probably focussed around conversational marketing.</p>

<p>This will result in painful changes and it will be interesting to see of what becomes of the big publishing houses. I for one know that I want some of them to survive, but mostly for some good solid journalism, not reprinting AP for Google Juice. Let&#8217;s see who pulls it off. At least I don&#8217;t want to see the death of the news papers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;I still have an old MacMini at home and I really like it but it is not really doing a lot. Thanks to a few wonderful tools out there I now have a wonderful machine to deal with my downloading pleasure. I am always looking for ways to use the systems I have here and this has turned out to be something where I think the TV world can or needs to go to.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So what&#8217;s the setup?&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;First of all I have <a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> running at all times, and it is configured to watch a special directory for torrent files and start downloading whenever it finds something in that directory (deleting the torrent file while it is at it). That folder actually resides on my <a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTkwMDk">DropBox</a> account, so I can always push stuff into that directory from where I might be at the time. This comes in handy when somebody suggests a movie, which I might add directly or just create a task in <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a> to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Next up is the Series part. Here I am currently trying out <a href="http://feedmytorrents.com/">FeedMyTorrents</a> just to see how it works and it is working like a charm. What that does is uses an app called &quot;Automatic&quot; for OS X where I can add RSS Feeds and it automatically downloads the enclosures into a given directory. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Next up is running a little script that takes any series and converts it to iPod High format via the Elgato Turbo.264, which does that in really wonderful speed and without making the fan of the mac mini run at 150% ;) Also I need to find a solution to really get TV series running here in Germany into the system. Currently I am recording them live on TV with a hard disk video recorder, but what I really would like to have is just <a href="http://boxee.net/">Boxee</a> down in the living room having all those movies/series via Bittorrent automatically. I do not &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to see them live and that might be easier than making Boxee record live TV.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So what do you do to automate your television pleasures? I know I am just starting to see the pieces fall together in real life, not just in my head.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s actually a way too short post for the blog but hey, I just read that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1010048/">Slumdog Millionaire</a> won 4 Golden Globes <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/15041/slumdog-millionaire-wins-four-golden-globes/">over at The Inquisitr</a> and I need to send out my congratulations.</p>

<p>The thing is that the movie is just plain wonderful to watch, with a great story and everything. Not a lot more to say really without giving away the story so I will leave it at this and let you watch the movie. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Wired has an article about <a href="http://www.wired.com/software/webservices/news/2008/12/YE8_web">6 new web technologies of 2008 you need to use now</a> and I have to agree. It&#8217;s nothing earth shattering for most people here on this blog but it is an interesting list and I would like to add a few comments. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Identity Management&lt;/strong&gt;: They are talking about <a href="http://openid.net/what/">OpenID</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/friendconnect/">Google Friend Connect</a>, and <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php">Facebook Connect</a> here even though they are slightly different things. The thing is that Google and Facebook are trying to be the central location where your friends graph, your social graph, are stored. Whenever you log in somewhere they want to know and will allow you to use your social graph within any service, taking your friends with you. But your friends would still belong to Google and Facebook. OpenID wants to be a standard for you to log in everywhere with one identity. There is no social graph bit there. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So there is not really one solution there, but identity is an important thing and it would be best if you control it somehow. I recently wrote about <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2009/01/11/getting-that-damn-address-book-in-sync/">Address Book Sync</a> and about <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2008/12/28/self-generated-content-infrastructure/">Self Generated Content Infrastructure</a> which is connected to this. It probably warrants another post. What is your identity online and are you at risk of loosing it?&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. HTML 5&lt;/strong&gt;: Agreed, very important but I know one or two security experts that are not all too thrilled about future features in things like HTML and JavaScript. But who am I to talk. We&#8217;ll all here enough about this when things start getting more concrete. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Lifestreaming&lt;/strong&gt;: This is what my <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2008/12/28/self-generated-content-infrastructure/">SGCI post</a> was about. I am running <a href="http://noserub.com/">Noserub</a> already, but I actually need it in a little bit different form, to really log my lifestream, because like blogging, I want my stuff searchable. And you need to make sure that whatever you use to generate your lifestream, you need to be able to get it out. Changing your status via Twitter is a good thing as it can be imported into Facebook and so on, but using Facebook would mean that you can hardly get it out again, so not into Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Firefox 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, my most used browser, even though I am trying to get a bit more use out of Safari just because it is faster, but I tend to gravitate back to Firefox. I am looking forward to using Google Chrome (their point 5) on OS X though.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Location Awareness&lt;/strong&gt;: This is slowly getting into the mainstream but will really take some time to really get there in terms of people sharing their current location. I like Aroundme as an iPhone app and it is really becoming one of my favorites and I co-founded <a href="https://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a> for a reason. For sharing your location the best I found up till now is <a href="http://brightkite.com/">Brightkite</a> because they got the security part just right.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;This will likely be an ongoing problem I have to say but I really hope somebody will start building something that works. The even bigger problem is that the real problem (understand by now that it&#8217;s a problem? ;)) that likely the players that hold (part of) my address book will need to support any move for a sync.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;But let&#8217;s move one step back. I tried a beta service called <a href="http://www.soocial.com/">Soocial</a> and didn&#8217;t back up my address book. Stupid me, agreed, happens a lot of times recently because I have my head full with other stuff and I expect things to work (it&#8217;s taken care of now). It synced with my local address book (close to a 1000 contacts), then with GMail (up to 1600) and suddenly it was going up, doubling contacts left and right and I was up to close to 3000. All that happened in the background. The service provides backup possibilities meaning it should have had a backup from my first sync but that backup was empty. And it got worse and worse and suddenly all was gone. Thankfully I have a sync with GMail and long ago decided to try to bring a large part of my contacts into <a href="http://xing.com/">Xing</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So one export from GMail, fill up with Xing data, and I am moving in the right direction again. I now set up an account with <a href="http://plaxo.com/">Plaxo</a>, after I made them delete my last login. It is amazing to see what kind of diverse group of people are in Plaxo I have to say and I am now using it as a focussed system to sync address book data. I would love it if they would hook up with Xing. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough I did not find any way to export my previous address book uploads to <a href="http://linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>, which would also have been a wonderful way to get back that data.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I really would like somebody to take care of all of this. There are different backup solutions, and I might try Soocial again at a later date, who are now probably the closest of the bunch I know to solve the problem. Plaxo for example only has one way Sync into GMail.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;What I would like is something that really syncs what I have. I mean lots of people have a photo inside Facebook, Xing, LinkedIn, Plaxo, Twitter or Noserub or whatever so why do I need to add them to my address book damn it! So this would be another interesting project for all of you out there. A real sync of my personal connections. Go cracking. Thank you. :) Suggestions of course always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;I actually wrote about this in 2002, called <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2002/11/11/blogging-goes-wireless/">Blogging goes Wireless,</a> where I said: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what journalists should be worried about. In a few years, millions of people will have mobile phones with high-quality integrated digital cameras. Whenever something happens anywhere in the world, pictures and eyewitness accounts will be up there on the web for everyone to see in no time. Of course, journalists will still rush to the scene to get the scoop - but the scoop will already be long gone, and journalists will almost never be the first on the scene anymore. It might not be good spelling or reporting, and it might not be objective, but it will be diverse, real and full of emotions. That’s the new way of spreading the news fast - so welcome the wireless blog, everyone.This is exactly what journalists should be worried about.

We are getting there though, especially with every mobile phone having a good enough camera and internet flatrates getting more common, or at least big enough data plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the Next web writes that <a href="http://thenextweb.com/2008/12/23/when-twitter-gets-mainstream-we-wont-miss-anything/">when Twitter becomes mainstream, we won&#8217;t miss anything</a>, making much the same point. The point is that somebody on an airplane crash twittered it live. This is actually what was missing in blogging, because you felt you needed to give some thought to it. For Twitter, just just send a Tweet and be done with it. It has to be short so it can&#8217;t really have too much thought put into it. It&#8217;s very easy, as SMS is, just like an SMS sent to everybody. This is why adoption can become higher and we get more messages out there. It&#8217;s a mixture of more people and faster posting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love seeing that and am really looking forward to seeing this system develop.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
