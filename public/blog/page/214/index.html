  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on OS News) Many companies are trying to move to a subscription model for their software and Apple really has something going for them in that respect if you think about it. We, OS X Users, are already accustomed to the automatic updating of the OS and like it. dotMAC actually looks nice all in all, even if some might feel it is expensive. What people don&#8217;t like is unpredictability; they have nothing against change as long as they like the outcome and know where it is going.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>What some people really feel surprised about is that Apple is taking big bucks for the Jaguar release of OS X and they want money for dotMAC on top of that. Where is this going in the future? Can we not trust anything to be part of the Apple package we have grown to like in the future? iTunes 3 was advertised to be free as if this would be out of the ordinary and while it might be in the general software world out there, it&#8217;s likely not in the eye of OS X users. The iApps are part of our OS X experience and while iCal is free, the synchronization features with other people need a dotMAC account, giving non dotMAC users nothing more than a crippled iCal.</p>

<p>In Q2 of this year, Apple had sales of 1.495 billion USD and came out of the quarter with 40 Million in profit. Their net operating cash flow was also positive with 44 Million USD. Based on this one can say, relatively safely, that Apple is profitable, as they are running their ship now. What Apple is doing with their recent move is to please some of their stakeholders, including their shareholders, which is something that is without a doubt very important. You need to have an integrated approach to please all of your stakeholders or you will stumble and fall. In the future, Apple also needs more money to push into new markets and extend their R&amp;D and get a good return on investment from their activities. This charging for added features is in that sense a good one.</p>

<p>What people don&#8217;t like I believe, is this charging on several fronts for something they have taken for granted up till now. Many companies have long seen that the way of the future is services, not web services mind you, that&#8217;s just a small picture, but services in general. In short, this could be said to be giving people what they want, enabling them to do what they want or have to do. I don&#8217;t want an OS. I don&#8217;t care for the OS. I want something that will let me do what I want to be doing in the best possible way and Apple has been known for being very user friendly. Many believe this is what OS X is all about, or what MacOS was all about. A better way of doing what you do. Less hassle, more fun, more efficiency.</p>

<p>Going further into Apple&#8217;s SEC filing for the recent quarter, they had sales of $383 Million for Power Macs, $198 Million for PowerBooks, $448 Million for iMacs and $180 Million for iBooks. Peripherals, software and other sales were $286 Million, which includes things like the iPod. Even if we include all of this as software, that&#8217;s an amount that doesn&#8217;t seem to hard to beat.</p>

<p>Where does this lead me to? Services and services only. Apple has or had some 2 million iTools, now dotMAC subscribers when it was still free. Let&#8217;s play a little game. Let&#8217;s suppose Apple were to move into services with force and stop &quot;selling&quot; the OS. It is part of the service. Also part of this service is dotMAC and all iApps. On top of that, you have a community on dotMAC where everybody can go to help, with users helping each other. Apple could give some of the best people some support and special pre-release info and other things to make them happy. Companies could monitor it for questions for their own software. Think of it as a self help or P2P help network. Again, it would be part of letting me do what I want to do. It needs to be frank and peer monitoring will make it as correct as possible.</p>

<p>Would you be willing to pay $10 per month do be part of that? That would be $120 per year, $20 more than the current subscription for dotMAC, and I think a lot of people would do that. At 2 Million subscribers, that would be $240 Million each year, without interruption, predictable, certain. And 2 million subscribers is nothing. Provided Apple can grow their market share they can get several more million using the service, who would be sure they have an up to date product, online storage space, a life-time e-mail, a place for a homepage, a place to put their images and sync their computer. On top, it creates a lock-in for future hardware sales.</p>

<p>There are a lot of added benefits, besides a predictable revenue stream too. They can sell to those people directly, give them suggestions for new hardware and give them the option to kind of sync their old mac and then their new mac to continue working without lots of difficulties. In a sense they would be able to loyalty into their sales package and wouldn&#8217;t shareholders just love the notion of seeing each new customer as a customer for live?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have just seen &quot;8 Femmes&quot; and I am very sorry to say that it is one of the worst movies I have seen in ages.</p>

<p>http://us.imdb.com/Title?0283832</p>

<p>Sure. It&#8217;s special. There are probably lots of great cinematography elements. It&#8217;s out of the ordinary and I might have perceived it better if I were able to see it in french instead of the horrible german version.</p>

<p>Imagine this. There are 8 women, somebody is murdered and they could all have done it. Through all of this, I couldn&#8217;t care less who was it. I did not feel any suspense, seriously. I am wondering myself why, but that&#8217;s just how it is. And they sing.</p>

<p>Ok, in the end, there was lots to talk about and I had several good laughs. It was well played by everybody, very well even. But I seriously thought about taking out my palm to read some stuff sometimes. The plot just doesn&#8217;t hold up when you think about it from time to time.</p>

<p>Some people will love it. Others will hate it. People walked out of the cinema before the end of the film and the entire cinema seems to have been laughing at how stupid the film was getting. Sometimes you thought you were watching a parody.</p>

<p>Sorry, needed to vent.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, The Register seems to have gotten info on the number of Nokia 7650s that are coming out of the factories each month now that they reached full production. Just as a relation, Palm managed to sell 300.000 palms per month last quarter.</p>

<p>There are now 750000 Nokia 7650s coming out of the factories!!! And they didn&#8217;t even launch the US version yet!</p>

<p>So much for volume. If this continues then Symbian will simply blow the roof of any other PDA sales.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on infoSync) I&amp;rsquo;m actually very happy with my trusted old Handspring Visor Platinum, but some days ago, I received a HP Jornada 565 from infoSync HQ so I could play around with Pocket PC 2002 and familiarize myself a bit more with the platfrom. My switch from a Palm OS to a Pocket PC device prompted me to write this column, in which I thought I&amp;rsquo;d let you in on what I found to be the most troublesome differences.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>To start with, I have to admit that it&amp;rsquo;s not really a fair match. On one side, you have 8 MB of storage, a 33 MHz Dragonball processor and 16 shades of grey, while on the other side, there&amp;rsquo;s a 206 Mhz StrongARM processor, 32 MB of storage, 65,536 colors, full sound and a Compact Flash expansion slot which works wonderfully with the CF cards for my Canon Ixus digital camera. I don&amp;rsquo;t even want to mention the price of the two devices here. So this is not really a match but rather just a look at two worlds.</p>

<p>I&amp;rsquo;m currently sitting here at a table in Brussels typing this with the Jornada next to me. It&amp;rsquo;s off now, to conserve power, because it just gave me a warning that I should charge it as soon as possible to avoid data loss. I charged it Friday afternoon, right before leaving from Germany to Belgium for the weekend. I admit, it had some heavy usage, but it needs to survive a weekend in my mind. From a simple comfort side, my tech stuff has to survive a weekend without eyeing for the charger. So much for having a cool color screen.</p>

<p>I love the CF slot, period. No questions asked. I have storage cards here and can use them for MP3s or other things. With cards of 512 MB available now, this thing can replace my MP3 player, which packs 6 GB of MP3s - but I also have to say that I don&amp;rsquo;t really need that many MP3s with me for short trips (for longer trips, I bring the iBook with all the MP3s ;).</p>

<p>But now for the interface, which is the main issue of this column. When I turned the device on, I noticed the similarity to Windows right away, which is actually a good thing as you kind of know your way around. The problem is, it&amp;rsquo;s not Windows and you will soon find out. You have a Start Menu, which can only hold 9 applications. It&amp;rsquo;s actually more of a quick-start menu. There is also an additional programs folder which works similarly to Palm OS with icons for each application on the screen and folders to order those. That really makes the Start Menu a neat kind of thing, but sadly I mistook it for its Windows counterpart.</p>

<p>Next up, multitasking. On a PPC you can run several applications at the same time, which is not possible on the current Palm OS. That allows you to, for example, play MP3s in the background and/or to stay connected with MSN Messenger while doing other things. Once you get used to it, this is actually very nice. Play a short 9 holes of golf and quickly check your tasks list without needing to save the game or start all over.</p>

<p>Now comes an annoying part again though. Closing applications. Let&amp;rsquo;s presume you have the Task application open and you are currently editing a Task item. You&amp;rsquo;re done. What now? So let&amp;rsquo;s close it - but how, since there&amp;rsquo;s no &quot;Save&quot; button? Upon closer inspection one notices that there is an OK button on the top right, which when clicked will actually &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Close&quot; (when there is nothing to be saved). Color me stupid, but if I want to save, I want to save, not OK. Then, in the main window of the application, there is a little X where the OK was, which arguably stands for &quot;Close&quot;. But it&amp;rsquo;s actually not close but minimize, as the application remains running and is moved out of sight. The so-called remedy is a task switcher, which lets you easily switch between running applications or fully close them. I don&amp;rsquo;t like running apps - I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why, even though it&amp;rsquo;s nice to play MP3s in the background. But if the button means minimize, and if this is supposed to work like windows, then make it look like minimise. For all I care, put an X and a _ next to it. Then one can perform both tasks. Microsoft was really annoying the hell out of me as my entire body said &quot;I know how this works.&quot; Just to realize that I didn&amp;rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Synchronization works wonderfully, even though I was surprised why my IMAP connection to the mail server was always braking down on the desktop. This is due to the fact that if you configure an IMAP account on the PPC to check regularly, it will also do that via the cradle, which is actually very nice I have to say, but it would be good if I could somehow turn it off easily. Now, when I put the device in the cradle I need to go through the preferences, turn it off, and go into the preferences again to turn it on before taking it out (&amp;lsquo;cause I like having my mails with me).</p>

<p>Now comes the annoying part though; Notes. I have some 200 notes in Outlook, nicely ordered into categories, and when I sync them, they all end up in the My Documents folder (yeah, there&amp;rsquo;s a folder structure on the PPC including a WINDOWS directory), all 200 of them, and the Notes application couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less for the categories I set up. Mightily annoying. Creating folders under Notes in Outlook does not do any good either. In a sense, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t so bad though, because I decided to put many of these notes in one single Word file and move the Word file to the PPC. I wanted to create nested folders for it in the My Documents folder - but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible either. You can only go one folder deep. Ok. Survivable, but strangely enough looking like Windows but not acting like it.</p>

<p>In the end I got the Word files moved to the Jornada, Notes almost emptied, and am actually partly happier as the Notes length limit on the Palm greatly annoyed me. Yeah sure, there are workarounds, but these things needs to work right out of the box.</p>

<p>What I also noticed is that many things need a lot more clicks than on the Palm, such as opening applications that are not in the Start Menu (I need a Today Screen plug-in to put apps right on there), or changing a Calendar or Task item, which requires opening them and then clicking Edit.</p>

<p>In the end, after this initial one week, I am not sure if I want to go back, even though I believe that the Palm has by far the better interface for doing what you are supposed to do with a PDA. The nice thing about the Pocket PC is that it stretches the limit what you do with your PDA, partly due to the color screen, partly due to the good expansion capabilities and partly due to the different OS that allows for multitasking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally pubished on OSNews) Operating systems are all the hype in the PC world and lots of companies want to get a good market share within the wireless space, especially in the new smartphone category. Microsoft is pushing their <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mobile/phones/default.asp">Smart Phone</a> operating system, <a href="http://www.danger.com/">Danger</a> has developed a new OS for their Hiptop, <a href="http://www.palmos.com/">Palm</a> is throwing theirs into the playing field and of course there is <a href="http://www.symbian.com/">Symbian</a>. Developers have a lot to choose from.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>First, what is so special about these operating systems? The main thing here is that they are designed to run on mobile phones, powerful mobile phones but still mobile phones. In a sense, they are smaller PDAs. They are smaller, have less screen space, less memory and less CPU power. They also need wireless capabilities and mobile phone manufacturers want to be able to differentiate themselves from the competition. The operating system needs to support things like Bluetooth, WAP, EMS, MMS, SyncML, IPv6, W-CDMA, GPRS, GSM, HSCSD and probably a lot more. All that with the least memory and CPU power possible.</p>

<p>So who&amp;rsquo;s trying to conquer the market?</p>

<p>Microsoft is moving into the space with force and they are arguing that their operating system for mobile phones, Smart Phone, will give users a well known interface, favorable in the corporate market. Smart Phone has already been adopted by Sendo in the Z100, but the phone has been delayed many times and developer version have come on sale for close to $1000, which is a lot for a mobile phone, even if it has a lot of capabilities. The phone looks very powerful and will likely work amazingly well with MS&amp;rsquo; .Net platform in the future, but it is unlikely that users will see a lot of Smart Phone based phones in the market any time soon, mainly because of the lack of support by major companies in the space. MS made a reference design and platform available which should easy introduction. I see a much better market for PocketPC 2002 Phone Edition, which enables PDAs to be outfitted with mobile phone capabilities and the XDA introduced by O2 is a very good example of a PDA phone, the best I have seen as of yet.</p>

<p>Danger is short from introduction of their Hiptop device, which looks very promising and will give carriers the option to brand it for their own network. The German T-Mobile network will soon launch the Hiptop for example. Due to being based largely on Java technology, the device already has a good developer base. What surprised me, is that in a recent interview on news.com, Danger mentioned that once they have sold several millions of their devices, they will likely focus mostly on getting their operating system to the market, partnering with device manufacturers, which want to use their operating system. The java part, gives it a good leg up there, but still, it&amp;rsquo;s a not an easy task.</p>

<p>Many manufacturers already have their own operating system for phones like Nokia&amp;rsquo;s NOS, but these are not really targeted to become real Smartphones with extended capabilities. Rather, these are, and will in the future, be used in standard mobile phones with or without data capabilities.</p>

<p>Palm is already running on some mobile devices, most notably on Handspring&amp;rsquo;s Treo line, which has received a very warm welcome. Recent sales numbers revealed though, that sales are in the tens of thousands, which is a really tiny number in an industry that just surpassed a billion users. Nokia reconfirmed in their June 20th strategy update that they plan to ship tens of millions of Java enabled mobile phones this year with surpassing the 100 million mark in 2003. Interesting to note here is that there is a J2ME engine for Palm available, again, putting Java into the picture.</p>

<p>The one company that is not yet on the radar of many people is most likely Symbian, spun off by Psion. What should be noted with this company is that it already gives away the OS that will be used by many of the big players in the industry today. Symbian is owned by Psion, Motorola, Panasonic, SonyEricsson, Ericsson, Siemens and Nokia. With Nokia having a market share of 37%, Motorola 15%, Siemens 9% and Sony Ericsson 6%, you will see that the above group has something close to 70% of the current market of mobile phones. They are all banking on Symbian to be their OS of choice for future smartphones with devices like the Nokia Communicator, Nokia 7650 and the SonyEricsson P800 already having been announced. And again, all these devices are Java capable.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>Looking at the above information, if a developer needs to choose now, they should choose Java, which will, or already is, the standard for mobile phone applications. For developers favoring C++, Symbian looks like the most promising architecture and while other manufacturers might brake into this space with a different operating system, they are unlikely to be able to displace Symbian as the most widely used OS on mobile devices in the near, or even far, future.</p>
