  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am actually not even done yet, but it already proves to be a wonderful book to read when founding or thinking of founding a company. Now <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2007/02/25/the_best_book_f.html">Paul reviewed it</a> and <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007/03/founders_at_wor.html">Guy did as well</a> and and they both love it. I can only agree. Yes, it is not something that you read to learn how to attract VCs, or to get a 3 step guide to launch a successful start-up. When you are starting a company though a bell rings in hundreds of places. I remember one part where one of the founders (I think it was Joe Krauss from Excite, JotSpot). When you are starting a company you have days where you think that you will rule the world, and the next day you wake up and you think it will all fall to pieces, and nothing between those days has changed. Nothing. You still have the drive to pull this through because you really believe in it and you think it is the right thing to do. There are endless of other parts in there that are a great read so I can only suggest buying the book.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wohoo! <a href="http://www.thealarmclock.com/euro/">alarm:clock euro</a> had a <a href="http://www.thealarmclock.com/euro/archives/2007/03/alarmclock_euro_puzz_16.html">quiz</a> again recently in which they asked to name the VC firm founder who made his first fortune in modems and fax cards. As a hint they added that the firm is now on its third and largest fund. Having run around in the venture scene a bit in the last few months, I obviously knew that they ment Dr. Gottfried Neuhaus from Neuhaus Partners in Hamburg. Also knowing Valerie form alarm:clock I had to quickly write the answer over to them and hey, I was the first! You can now see my wonderful picture right <a href="http://www.thealarmclock.com/euro/archives/2007/03/alarmclock_euro_puzz_17.html">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Great video that Bob Stumpel posted on his Web 2.0 blog. You can view it <a href="http://bobstumpel.blogspot.com/2007/02/business-20.html">here</a>. It&#8217;s a panel moderated by <a href="http://www.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a> with lots of different entrepreneurs talking about how they started, what their business models were and are now, what the good and bad sides of founding a business are and why you just have to work yourself through the ups and downs.</p>

<p>Great stuff to listen too and a good mix of sites that partly didn&#8217;t or still don&#8217;t have a real business model.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;There we go, the real business model of <a href="http://mybloglog.com/">MyBlogLog</a>
is out and it is coming to you thanks to Jennifer Slegg from Jensense. In <a href="http://www.jensense.com/archives/2007/02/mybloglog_track.html">this post</a> she talks about a little bit of code in the general MyBlogLog code you put on your blog. We all know that MyBlogLog will know who comes to your site and from where, which alone is some very interesting information. But the little addition to the code, allows MyBlogLog to track your Google AdSense and Yahoo! Publisher Network ads.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Tracking in this sense means that they know how many ads you serve and how many ads you get as well as on which ads. Based on the Google AdSense click url they know for example where the click is going, the client id, the position on the ad and more. They can also find out the text of the ad. With some additional javascript they also know where on your blog the ad is.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So in the end, they know if people click more on AdSense or YPN ads in similar locations, which formats work best for AdSense, which ads work best, which wording changes for the same keywords and same clients but different ads work best and so on. And the fun thing is that Yahoo! bought MyBlogLog some time ago. Of course, the code seems to have been there beforehand, but hey, this is likely something that Yahoo! is very happy about. They should actually include it in the flicks badges!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The amount of data and the quality (or potential quality) of it is amazing. Even more congratulations on the buy from me!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Answer from the MyBlogLog people <a href="http://mybloglogb.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/02/on_mybloglogs_a.html">here</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sadly, this is in German, but it&#8217;s a great study project from 2005, in three parts, explaining the power of money. In short, you need to make people work to control the planet. To make people work, you invent money, because that makes exchanging things very easy. Of course some people have more money, and they give it to you because they are afraid to loose it. You give them a bit more money back in return, like 2% per year. Of course, because there is a law the requires a bank to only hold 2-10% of the money they lend out, you can then lend out 10 times that money for a credit of 10% per year, making you money for nothing. This goes on an on. Very well done. See it <a href="http://www.cyberbloc.de/index.php?/site/comments/so_funktioniert_geld/">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.holtzbrinck-ventures.com/">Holtzbrinck Ventures</a>, who are building up an impressive <a href="http://www.holtzbrinck-ventures.com/index.php?portfolio_de">portfolio</a> (plus Webnews.de) in Germany, have started something new called &quot;<a href="http://www.holtzbrinck-ventures.com/index.php?fast_forward">Fast Forward</a>&quot; and I really like the idea. It is something that is really needed in Germany and might push things a bit forward.</p>

<p>The idea is simple. You submit your business plan, or rather a shorter one, focussing on the market potential, the founding team and how to use the money or rather what kind of money you need in the next 12 months. The goal is to have a proof of concept with the 150k of course.Â  That obviously means that they won&#8217;t fund a biotech startup with this kind of money. :)</p>

<p>The money will be given as a loan to the company and will only convert into equity (at a discount to account for the added risk) with the first round of investment.</p>

<p>What I really like about this is that it helps Holtzbrinck Ventures get a foot in the door in a market where business angels are more and more becoming an alternative for companies that are looking for money. With a timeframe of 3 weeks until investment, a good founding team with a few good numbers and a good case might be able to move really fast with this.</p>

<p>So congratulations to Holtzbrinck Ventures. Good move! (<a href="http://www.thealarmclock.com/euro/archives/2007/01/holtzbrinck_ventures_1.html">source</a>)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was bound to happen, and now it&#8217;s a fact. <a href="http://fon.com">FON</a> gets competition in the name of <a href="http://whisher.com">Whisher</a>, which was launched at <a href="http://demo.com/">DEMO</a> yesterday. Venturebeat has a <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2007/01/30/whisher-tackles-fon-launches-its-own-wifi-nation/">good write-up</a> about it, including that <a href="http://benchmark.com/">Benchmark Capital</a> Europe with Klaus Hommels led the investment round. Interestingly enough both start-ups are starting in Spain, but that is another matter. The interesting thing is not to see who will get the better coverage. In my view FON has the upside that coffee shops and the like will get a router for free or cheap and can really earn money in the system, meaning that you are likely to find a FON hotspot in a coffee shop or hotel in the not too distant future (I actually found a small conference hotel near here that has one :)). The good side with Whisher is really that it has a very likely viral effect. I often go to friends and they have a wireless lan and I have to ask for the key and things. With Whisher we can all be part of a community that trusts each other and allows us to share each others wifi in an easy and simple manner. You simply install an application that gives you access to other hotspots that are part of the network, simple as that.</p>

<p>I will have to try it out to get a better idea but they have the money to really push it now, which is good. We need more stuff like this and it is still undecided who will win in the end.</p>

<p>P.S.: And I am starting to see some scenarios where a pub might really want to have a Whisher hotspot with community features rather than a FON hotspot. They don&#8217;t really need to earn money but can see it as a marketing expense, which they do anyway. We&#8217;ll see how this plays out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just found <a href="http://www.getafirstlife.com/">Get a First Life</a> <a href="http://adverlab.blogspot.com/2007/01/get-first-life.html">via MIT Advertising Lab</a>. It&#8217;s pretty simple. Go outside, it&#8217;s free, and there are over 6 billion members already! Got any more questions? The have an FAQ for things like:
&lt;ul&gt;</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;      Are five senses enough?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;What's this body thing, and what do I do with the dangly bits?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Why can't I build a dirigible with my mind?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Penguins, spoons and you -- what's life like among the flightless?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
</code></pre>

<p>&lt;/ul&gt;
So go there. As they say: &lt;em&gt;First Life is a 3D analog world where server lag does not exist.&lt;/em&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I received the results from the pre DLD survey and I like them. First of all, not that many people took part (228) but it is still interesting and I am happy to know that I am party of the only 25% who also have been at DLD 06 :) Congratulations also to <a href="http://www.ibrahimevsan.de/">Ibrahim</a> to having made the &quot;Other Leading Entrepreneurs of 2006&quot; list.</p>

<p>The good things for us at <a href="https://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a> is really the Important Topics for 2007 part. Obviously it starts with &lt;em&gt;user generated content&lt;/em&gt;, going on with &lt;em&gt;communities, social networks&lt;/em&gt;,Â  next up &lt;em&gt;online video content&lt;/em&gt;, and then at place 4 &lt;em&gt;performance based marketing&lt;/em&gt; with 79% saying it is very or somewhat important. This is of course wonderful to hear and something we very much believe in. Then there is the &quot;Best Business Model&quot; which in second place (36%) has providing a platform for customers&#8217; transactions which is again very close to what we do. Allowing local merchants to get new customers on a per lead (customer contact) basis, generated via ad campaigns that they could never run on their own, is really just a platform that facilitates transactions between merchants and users. This is really the mix of advertising, performance marketing, and a platform for transactions.</p>

<p>Well, we&#8217;re looking forward to rocking 2007 then :)</p>
