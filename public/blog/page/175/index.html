  <div class="entry-content"><p>Amazing concert, and amazingly loud. My ears are still ringing with my right one feeling a little weird. The place was a bit empty though with double the amount of people potentially having fit. That was probably part of the reason that the concert started a little slow. LC came on the stage in full force but the crowd was likely packed with musicians who wanted to see what the 4 guys will do in their respective fields. There was really very little movement in the crowd at that time.</p>

<p>But you just can&#8217;t keep yourself from starting to get into it. I have to say that Living Colour Live is a few notches better than on the Album. They are performing the music, they are one sound level up, playing with the song, not simply playing the song. This wasn&#8217;t so evident when I saw them last time some 8 years ago (?). I particularly liked the new songs but they had some mixes of old ones that were truely great. Core Glover amazed me this time with his voice, with Back in Black rocking the crowed. Vernon Reid most of the time looks really unemotional I have to say, which has a special charm to it though. He has his outburst but otherwise he just seems to be his guitare and himself alone, some people in front of him by pure chance. Doug Wimbish is simply amazing, a true artists and it was interesting seeing him get weird sounds out of everything including the air drums or whatever those were. Having playing drums myself, I will simply kneel in front of the mighty William Calhoun ;) The power of the band is amazing. Go see them if you are into loud, hard music with a high noise factor. I can only repeat what I said when the album came out, this is not only music, but sound, ment in a positive way.</p>

<p>For the tech adicts, it might be interesting that both doug and vernon had apple laptops which especially doug was using frequently. Oh, and <a href="http://livingcolour.com/">the official Living Colour web site</a> is now open. Enjoy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well&#8230; it seems that the power key on the Palm Tungsten T uses some kind of software to work because it didn&#8217;t work and now, after a hard reset it does. Strangely enough you need the power button for the hard reset to work, which didn&#8217;t work (the power button that is) but the hard reset worked. I don&#8217;t think that I need to understand that. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I put this in Business, because I can and because Google is ultimately about business but the thing they understood is that to ultimately be about business, you need to be about the consumer, without questioning. &lt;a title=&quot;Google News Creator Watches Portal Quiet Critics With &#8216;Best News&#8217; Webby&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ojr.org/ojr/kramer/1064449044.php&quot;&gt;OJR article: Google News Creator Watches Portal Quiet Critics With &#8216;Best News&#8217; Webby&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p><a href="http://news.google.com/">Google News</a> is often attacked to not being a news site. Here is what the man behind it, <a href="http://searchwell.com/krishna/Krishna.Bharat.html">Krishna Bharat</a>, has to say about that: &lt;I&gt;The thing I think is indicative of a news source is that some portion of the world believes it&#8217;s a news source. Who are we to tell them it&#8217;s not news?&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>And this is a very interesting point in the Interview:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;OJR: Did you wonder if you had the right to do this with other people&#8217;s sites?</p>

<p>KB: The nice thing about research is until you actually make a product, you just want to find out if it works. In the long run, the issue of rights had to be addressed. In a sense, it was a no-brainer because what we do fundamentally at Google is we take people to the content &#8211; and this is another way to take people to the content. We don&#8217;t manufacture content. We don&#8217;t substitute our content for theirs.</p>

<p>Usually when people come to Google search, they tell us what they&#8217;re looking for. In the context of news it&#8217;s unfair to ask them to tell us what they&#8217;re looking for &#8211; because it&#8217;s news. It&#8217;s new. They may not know it&#8217;s happening, so the burden is on us to tell them what&#8217;s interesting and new. &#8230;&lt;/I&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Very good writing here: &lt;a title=&quot;Weblogging (Spiked)&quot; href=&quot;http://www.spy.co.uk/Articles/Spiked/Weblogging/&quot;&gt;Spy: Writing: Weblogging (Spiked)&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing I have to object to is that Bloggers need to become more like Journalists, proofing stories and things. What is needed is that a clear and coherent picture is giving of events, taking into account different view points. That might not mean that Journalistic Standards are the ultimate answer though. Maybe there is something better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seems like the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at Cern will go online. To process the amount of data they will collect for finding out what really happened at the time of the big bang, they need a new kind of computer. Welcome &quot;The Grid&quot;. What they do is connect the computer in research centres world wide to allow them to analyse the 20 million CDs of data likely to be collected each year. &quot;This will have a profound effect on the way society uses information technology, much as the worldwide web did.&quot; &lt;a title=&quot;BBC NEWS | Technology | Huge computing power goes online&quot; href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3152724.stm&quot;&gt;BBC NEWS | Technology | Huge computing power goes online&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>Of course we already had something similar with Seti@Home, where computers donated their computing power to find aliens in outer space, but The Grid is a lot bigger in terms of computing power it can tab into and if I understand it correctly they will make these machines one big computer, not allow each one of them to crunch a little bit of data on their own.</p>
