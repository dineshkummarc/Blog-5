  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some times at talk shows, the audience has to vote for something, and when I was watching one of these shows the other day I was surprised to see how many people had to put their wallet on their lap to reach for the voting device. A wallet. You know, one of those leathery things with your credit and debit cards and lots of receipts and your driver&#8217;s license and such.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>This got me thinking about the great mobile phone and technology-savvy world we live in. Shouldn&#8217;t all they be putting down be a mobile phone or some other device? What are we doing with paper? I also have one of those wallets. There&#8217;s lots of paper in it and VISA cards and other things. Couldn&#8217;t I move this onto my Visor or better yet, onto my mobile phone?</p>

<p>To start with I need to be able to pay without the need of my wallet, just to get all the other junk out of the way. The obvious solution would be a VISA card and this is where I started my search.</p>

<p>VISA is working on something they call u-commerce, which stands for universal commerce, or commerce without boundries. This is mainly because they believe that no one system will prevail, but that you will have a lot of different payment methods to choose from and they will be usable on all, or at least most, of them. VISA&#8217;s first CEO, Dee Hock, already said that payment transactions &quot;will require communications networks reaching out to wherever a customer chooses to be.&quot;</p>

<p>VISA believes that four fundamental factors for u-commerce are needed: Simplicity, Security, Systems and Standards. I can probably agree with this, especially as it makes a nice buzz term again, the 4 S-es of u-commerce (my term, not theirs).</p>

<p>MasterCard is, of course, also looking into mobile commerce, or m-commerce in short. I first noticed this when flying back from London where the airport was full of ads with mobile phones with a MasterCard sign on them. Looking through their <a href="http://www.mastercardintl.com/newtechnology/mcommerce">site on m-commerce</a> you will see that they have several possible ventures running.</p>

<p>One of these is a smart card phone which will be fitted with a smart card reader in the phone to read the chip that will soon appear on all credit cards for security purposes. This just makes paying easier as the chip includes all your shipping information and everything.</p>

<p>Another option would be to put the credit card information directly on the chip in your mobile phone, the SIM card and yet another one to put that information at a trusted location like your bank. In the last case you will work with 3-way transactions between your mobile phone, bank and merchant. This would be a mobile phone-accessed e-wallet.</p>

<p>The fourth method they talk about is mobile phone verification, which means you do not give your credit card number at check-out but your phone number. You are then called up or sent a text message, either of which you confirm to and your payment is taken care of, with the help of your credit card provider of course.</p>

<p>Some things are starting to fall into place now. One thing that comes to mind is that all the receipts in my wallet would be in my phone. If the phone can sync with my desktop, via Bluetooth or the IR-port, then I could also import or print them there. The big picture is starting to get lot clearer now, and all of these options are viable. My wallet might be redundant in no time.</p>

<p>If you take a look at the methods in last week&#8217;s article (&lt;I&gt;Note: the article was published in two parts&lt;/I&gt;)  you will notice that only the first two will really require extensive changes in your mobile phone, as you will either need to install a chip card reader or alter the SIM card. I then remembered that Nokia actually announced a new phone for quarter 1 of 2002, the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/phones/6510/main_feat.html">6510</a>, which will have a mobile wallet installed. With this phone, your credit card information is simply stored on your SIM card. Interestingly enough there is, or was, a trial going on in Australia between VISA and Nokia with a server based wallet.</p>

<p>There are probably different factors influencing these two systems and one might be the perceived security, not to be confused with real security. While the server based wallet is probably as secure or even more secure than the SIM card based one, the general perception will be that you kind of want your credit card with you in your pocket. Storing it remotely might feel out of place for some people, and this is probably why Nokia chose the SIM card solution for the 6510.</p>

<p>But what about the last method? At this time, welcome <a href="http://www.paybox.net/">PayBox</a>, a German company that is establishing itself slowly but surely. To use the system, you register with your bank account and PayBox then acts as a link between your mobile phone and your bank account. If I would like to pay for a cab then I give the driver my mobile phone number, or alias, and he enters it into his system. I then get a phone call and a nice voice tells me that this cab driver is requesting an amount of X EUR. I can then say yes and enter my password and the money is securely deducted from my bank account. For me, the entire system is free. The system is gaining acceptance on the web, at least in Germany, but for paying in stores it is moving along at a slower pace, partly because a POS (point-of-sale) terminal is needed there.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve mostly talked about mobile phones up till now, but Palm also has some ideas. These involve proximity payment which means that you have for example a Bluetooth chip in your mobile phone and there is a Bluetooth POS at your merchant and your phone and the POS talk to each other via Bluetooth to handle the transaction. The good side with this is that it is most likely will happen a lot faster and could also be working in super markets with automatic payment once you walk out of the store. The bad side is that you need a lot more hardware to get it work.</p>

<p>Another thing needs to be remembered in all this very complicated but highly interesting field as well: Mobile phone companies want part of that beef too and what they might do is let you pay for things with your mobile phone bill. They can&#8217;t go a lot further than that though because they are not really allowed to store money for you. This is what banks can do and getting a bank license is really, really hard. The German Mobilcom said some time ago that they wanted to form a bank but didn&#8217;t mention anything about it ever since. If you handle transactions only, like PayBox, VISA or PayPal, then you do not need a bank license and can expand worldwide a lot easier.</p>

<p>What the phone companies might be handling somewhat more efficiently is micro-payments. Paying for a coke with your VISA card is not really efficient but if you pay with your phone bill then it might work a lot easier. You can already get a coke out of a vending machine with your mobile phone in Finland, and I am sure this will be something that we will be accustomed too fairly soon. An example of this can be what Europolitan Vodafone and TietoEnator are <a href="http://www.infosync.no/show.php?id=1159">launching</a> a new payment method in Sweden. I also recently learned that you can pay for drinks and subway tokens with your mobile phone in Santiago (Chile).</p>

<p>So what have we cared for now? We can possibly remove a large chunk of our money as well as some of our cards from our wallet and at the same time will get fewer receipts in your wallet. What we have not yet cared for are our licenses that we need to carry with us but still, our wallet has the potential to shrink a great deal in the not to distant future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I just returned from the lung specialist. Seems like I really had an astma attack. She is just not sure yet where it came from as I have a rather bad infection which could be a cause, or part of a cause. Now we need to get that out of the way which results in me being a walking pharmacy at the moment.</p>

<p>I am forbidden to go outside. No walks of any kind. Rest, total rest. When measuring my lungs the following appeared. Based on liters of air both breathing in and out, a normal thing is 70% of some standard amount. For my age 80-90% would actually be what would be expected. I am at the moment at 35% which seems to be very bad. This explains why walking up the 4 floors to our new place takes ages. Any 90 year old could overtake me. :)</p>

<p>So now I need to rest and get this infection out which will most likely remove most of my breathing problems. Then a new line of tests comes next monday. I am actually feeling good I have to say, as long as I don&#8217;t run around I am just fine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the last few days I have been renovating the old place in Aachen, painting and all. Starting on Thursday I got a bit of a cough, which was not too bad and I thought it was some kind of allergie because my nose had some problems too, which happens in recent times when I am in the old place. The place is very dusty and things and when I come back to Cologne my nose stops running almost the next day.</p>

<p>Anyway. The cough got a bit worse on friday evening and I had trouble sleeping because when I was in bed the coughing got worse and breathing was sometimes hard. Saturday was not too bad again but I didn&#8217;t sleep more than 3 hours to Sunday and stayed home, going back to Aachen for some final work on the place and giving it back to the landlord. This was very early and I was not feeling well at all. There was still a lot of dust and smell from the paint in the place.</p>

<p>I later came back home to Cologne but the cough was not good and it was rather hard, I didn&#8217;t cough up any green peaces or something. It was just coughing like crazy which hurt in my head each time. Breathing also got harder again which I thought was part of the cough.</p>

<p>Around 23:30 my girlfriend came back home after work and I knew that if something wouldn&#8217;t change, and the stuff from the pharmacy that I had was not really working, then I wouldn&#8217;t sleep any more than 1 or 2 hours this night and I wouldn&#8217;t be able to take it. So we decided to go to the hospital which in the end was a good decision.</p>

<p>I had to walk really slowly to be able to feel like I had enough air in my lungs and when we finally came there the person there gave me oxigen right away, which is kind of a nice feeling I have to say. But my oxigen level in my blood was ok.</p>

<p>The doctor came and she listened a bit to what I had to say and listened to my lungs and stuff and well, she said that I have some spastic simptoms in my lung, something like an astma attack, not sure if that word is spelled like this in english.</p>

<p>After the xrays and blood tests it seems that I also have a slight infection in the lungs but nothing major. They gave me some medicine and I could breath again normally which rocks. I also got something to inhale for at home.</p>

<p>I have a date with a lung specialist tomorrow morning to really check my lungs out to see if it is was a one time thing, and alergic reaction, something else, &#8230; it&#8217;s all not sure. But hey, at the moment I am feeling like I have the flue, which rocks after not being able to breath ;)</p>

<p>I will post more on this interesting experience after my doctors visit tomorrow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought Fortune magazine a few days ago and there is a really interesting article about Ricardo Semler and his company Semco in there. It is titled &quot;The Anti-Control Freak&quot;.</p>

<p>His father handed him control of Semco when Ricardo was 22 and he was quick to act. The company was not doing well and is now growing at 24% annually.</p>

<ul>
<li>He fired most top managers.</li>
<li>Got rid of most management layers, there are 3 left now.</li>
<li>He eliminated nearly all job titles. There is still a CEO but a half-dozen senior managers trade title every six months in March and September.</li>
<li>Executives set their own pay and <em>everybody</em> knows what the other one makes.</li>
<li>All workers set their own hours.</li>
<li>Every employee receives the company&#8217;s financial statements and the labor union holds classes so that they understand them.</li>
<li>Workers choose their managers themselves and evaluate them frequently posting the result publicly.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you told that to an old school manager they would freak out, but it seems to be working. Semco is now studied t Harvard and MIT&#8217;s Sloan School of Management.</p>

<p>The idea is simple. Treat people like adults and try to create a place where people want to come to work to and give up control, taking management out of running the company.</p>

<p>Some of his questions were. Why do we have job titles? Why can&#8217;t employees know all the financial details? Why do we have a headquarter? Semco has a few offices in Sao Paulo and if you want to leave home to use one - your choice - you go online and reserve a place.</p>

<p>He also touched an idea that I ask myself frequently. Why does a company have to grow? Of course for a public company the investors might want to get money out of it but hey, if they get a dividend that is good then you do not really need to grow. The best answer I had was probably that you need to try to grow because otherwise the danger of the opposite is high.</p>

<p>Why make money? Semler said something interesting: &quot;I once worked it out - after $12 million, all millionaries are the same.&quot; That&#8217;S because we&#8217;re all humans, confined to human scale. How many homes can you live in? How many meals can you eat? You can have a living room the size of a cathedral, but you won&#8217;t live in it. It&#8217;s too big.</p>

<p>The article ends:</p>

<p>&quot;Semler is as clear as ever about why he does what he does. The challenge for the rest of us is dealing with the fact that it works.&quot;</p>

<p>What I find interesting is that it seems rather close to the Chaordic Age by Dee Hock.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>T-Mobile, my mobile phone provider and sister company of Deutsche Telekom, launched a new service named &quot;Happy Digits&quot; with which you can gain points for money spent with your mobile phone. Cool service as such but the real clue comes in the rules.</p>

<p>You need to have a so called &quot;Buchungs Konto Nummer&quot; which is your account number for your <em>fixed line</em> phone! So people can only use Happy Digits if they use Deutsche Telekom as their fixed line provider :) LOL. That removes me from that list as I am using a competitor for my fixed line. LOL</p>

<p>Not bad I have to say. Not that it will make me switch, but it is nice to see that DT tries to tie their companies together ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just spent the last few days in Kiel with my gf, her mother and her brother. It was a real fun few days I have to say and they passed way too fast. Her brother just returned from the Maledives (hope I spelled that correctly) where we was a tour guide for 8 months. Nice job. Get up, great some people, rest on the beach all day, maybe go out with the boat with a few people with dolphins swimming next to you, some more work in the evening and you are done. Of course that is after mastering the task a bit and not trying to solve everything at once. But the tails he has are amazing. He was diving once and on his second trip the diving instructor pointed up and there was a 4 meter wide fish above him. Sting ray? Not exactly, something like that, you know the flat ones that sometimes rest on the floor covered by sand, but not that one but the other one, there seem to be two kinds of them. But anyway, he said he wasn&#8217;t shure at this time if he should be amazed or scared ;)</p>

<p>Nokia Game is going well but I somehow have missed some points it seems. Grrr&#8230; It&#8217;s still interesting to follow what is going on there and it should be another week until we are done. I don&#8217;t really want at Nokia 5510, which is the price for the top 50 people, anyway. There are some amazing Nokia phones coming out it seems, to be announced tomorrow in Barcelona. Once color screen one which looks cool.</p>

<p>Next weekend I will have my Management Challenge with the Open University. In Windsor near London. I should have been flying over from Brussels but now with Sabena bancrupt there were some problems with the way back. Now I switched to Lufthansa from Duesseldorf which are better times anyway. I should be meeting one or two of the people in my Tutor group at Heathrow airport and we will get a cab together. The place I am going to is some kind of old building form 1850 or something with 15 acres of land, swimming pool and everything. 100 students and 10 tutors will be there to go over last years subjects with us. As far as I have been told from other people it is a lot of fun, with almost no sleep. Ah well.</p>

<p>I also found out that one of the people from my old school is working at a security company now. He was one of the left wing kind of people, going to demonstrations, organizing them, being very scared of being listened to by the government in his appartment. Then he started getting into computers and started doing linux stuff, started doing encryption and now he is working at some security company that audits company networks. Doing speeches at conventions, running courses, auditing networks. It totally fits. Brought a smile on my face when he heard how well he is doing there.</p>

<p>Somebody else who really never seemed like somebody who wanted to study or work hard or somethig, heavy metal fan, drinking a lot, not doing anything &#8230; well now he has worked inside Nato with top security clearance and is doing is doctor in politics ;)</p>

<p>There are some very interesting people in my class I have to say. Another one is finishing has law degree now, then he wants to become an airline pilot ;)</p>

<p>A fun, have to go to the city now get a gift for a friend who is teaching martial arts here in cologne. It was his birthday yesterday. We are going out for thai food.</p>
