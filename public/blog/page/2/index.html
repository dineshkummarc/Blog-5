  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;We are all getting used to the idea of freemium but I am wondering if this will not implode because things are starting to add up. I really noticed when recently thinking (again) about how to restructure my services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$25 per year - Remember the Milk: I am definitely keeping this one as it is really cheap and a great deal especially with iPhone Integration through ToDo.&lt;/li&gt;</p>

<p>  &lt;li&gt;$59 per year - Vimeo: the service just rocks, period. I love how the videos end up and through the pro service I can really limit where videos are allowed to appear and keep my family videos sharable and save.&lt;/li&gt;</p>

<p>  &lt;li&gt;$12.60 a month - Squarespace: I just wanted to ditch servers and this is probably the first one that might have to go once I find a better solution but I didn&#8217;t yet. Squarespace is really nice and if they finally get their social integration done I am starting to be really happy. It is the most expensive point though and I could just go with Wordpress.com and the biggest problem would be that my tags are shared with all wordpress people. Ah well.&lt;/li&gt;</p>

<p>  &lt;li&gt;Stopped - Flickr: I just stopped my premium Flickr subscription as I am sharing most pictures with Family on Squarespace and that is good enough. I might actually still need that somehow.&lt;/li&gt;</p>

<p>  &lt;li&gt;$99 per year - Dropbox: I am actually not paying yet as I have a 10GB account due to an early beta membership (u 900 ;)) but this will surely stick.&lt;/li&gt;</p>

<p>  &lt;li&gt;â‚¬5.95 per month - Xing: For my networking in Germany still a wonderful thing.&lt;/li&gt;</p>

<p>  &lt;li&gt;$49.95 per year - Plaxo Premium: I want my addressbook safe and I would actually love Xing to do this but they don&#8217;t. Still really not happy in this field.&lt;/li&gt;</p>

<p>  &lt;li&gt;all the forgotten stuff: There are probably things I have forgotten as they end up coming on the bill once a year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, there will be more services like this and this is really starting to annoy me. It&#8217;s all cheap enough to not think enough but it is adding up. All the &quot;small fees&quot; currently end up to be over 200 USD, more if I ever get the Dropbox Account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what subscriptions do you have? :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: I am wondering if I should not just move to Wordpress.com, upload videos there, and so on. Anyone using Wordpress for Videos?&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;I am starting to use my Kindle more and more. Hence it was time to finally write about it. To start with, I have to say that I really like it, just so you have a frame of reference for the rest of this article. I will try to go into some of the bad things as well as things that I would categorize as weird, as well as the good sides, finishing of with some basic ideas of where this will go in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So let&#8217;s start with the bad and the weird side. This really only comes up when you use the thing for some time. First of all, you need to teach yourself that this is a book. Sadly I am a geek and this is technology. So I carry it around with me at all times. Obviously I forgot it in the office over the weekend. That would never have happened with a book because you would not carry it around with you to all places. As the Kindle has all your books you are then missing all your books. So handle it like a book and keep it at the night stand ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the second point. We all want some kind of haptic feedback with buttons, a kind of clicking sound when we press them. But for this device it might be something you don&#8217;t want. In bed with my wife, not reading something but more scanning it, can get &#8230; click &#8230; really &#8230; click &#8230; annoying &#8230; click &#8230; for my &#8230; click &#8230; wife. click. In the long run this is not a problem but for now people are not used to books clicking.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;But that is mostly it with the bad sides for me. I really like the device. The most important thing, the reading quality, is really good and on par with paper. Standby/Reading time is great. The wireless works like a charm and buying books was great. Working well is also the Amazon conversion question, though I mostly used the free system where the converted files end up in your mailbox to be moved to the Kindle via USB.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I am actually moving a lot of my &quot;Read Later&quot; items to the Kindle and used it on a recent flight to Zurich as my way to read up on all the articles I still wanted to read. I actually built myself a small Automator Script that takes the current clipboard, creates a text file, attaches it to an email and sends that to my free Kindle e-mail for conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The other great item is the sample chapter bit for books. It brings browsing back to the digital world and I am actually getting some ideas for new interfaces to Amazon that enable that on your browser. This free first chapter and general book wireless transfer to the Kindle is actually something I would want to have for any content I have to admit. Having to move text to the Kindle per USB is a pain and again makes you take the Kindle with you, which again brings you back to the problem I talked about earlier: forgetting the Kindle somewhere. I am currently not doing this wirelessly as it costs too much money for the international version, $0.99 per transfer and MB to be exact. That really needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I really think that this is the first step to a lot of things changing in the future and some things I see as a requirement for future eReaders and improvements to the Kindle, some of which I am sure will be coming.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;h3&gt;Wireless is a must&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The will need to have full wireless for all things and somebody needs to find a solution for sending stuff into the system for free or a good fee (e.g. 5 EURs a month for 100MB and unlimited amount of transfers per month). Only through this will it be something that you leave around everywhere and are sure that it is always synced. This could theoretically also be simple Wifi but &#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;h3&gt;Global Roaming&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Great treat from Amazon. I will get my books and magazines and articles wherever. On holiday. Before a flight, after a flight. You will want to get them at any time and this is why it needs to be real wireless not only Wifi. Wifi is just not available everywhere and still not easy enough to log in to.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;h3&gt;A New Browsing System&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The sample chapter bit enables digital browsing. I want an interface that allows me to scan racks of book covers, giving me a sample chapter with one click on the cover. This re-enables browsing in the digital world. Somebody build that please, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;h3&gt;Syncing of clippings back into Amazon&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I really like the clipping system and I would love it to sync back into Amazon or somewhere where I can easily get a hold of my clippings. These are a) too valuable to get lost and b) I would often like to add quotes to a Tumbler Blog or somewhere else. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;h3&gt;Better Organization Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I need an option to make folders and things, to be better able to order lots and lots of different articles and things. The defaults are just too chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;h3&gt;Webservice Integration&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I would like to send stuff I read, possibly with clippings attached and everything to things like Evernote. I just don&#8217;t want to loose these things. I think this is the same for other people. Due to the natur of this things you will want to have further interactions around the book. Looking at comments and clippings from my friends would obviously be nice. Imagine a corporate clipping service running on this.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;All in all there is still a long way in front of us for the perfect device. The Kindle is better than good enough for my taste though. It provides the basics that are needed to get me to change my habits and adapt a new way to read written words. This is what this device does very well and having taken a look at others, and looked at the entire package they offer, the Kindle is the only one that really delivers the goods.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So yes, I would buy it again.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;I just ordered an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?tag=olivthylsthou-20">International Kindle</a> and boy am I looking forward to it. There has been some discussion going on about the prices for Books in the USA and for example here in Germany. Just <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/oct/09/kindle-charges">read this on the Guardian</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then comes <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/german_chancellor_tells_google_you_cant_just_go_ar.php">our Chancellor talking about book scanning and digital books</a>. Seems like she does not believe that eBooks will ever replace real books.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;As there is too much to say to both these points to put them on Twitter I am blogging again ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Number 1: Hell digital books will put a huge dent into print books. Of course there will still be printed books but they will go the way of vinyl, even though not as drastically and in a longer timeframe. Just listen to Amazon saying that for books that are available digitally and in print, almost 50% of sales are digital! Thinking that the digital revolution will stop at print is nuts.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Number 2: Prices are cheaper in the USA. Yes, they are. It&#8217;s $9.99 for a NYT best seller. Amazon already stated in the country specific information that e.g. for Germany you pay $11.99 to $13.99 per book, which cheaper ones being available. The thing is that the extra charges might seem steep but you know what? For Germany it is still very cheap. It is actually what is touched upon in the article on RWW above: We have fixed book prices here, and I will have to buy my digital books in the USA for the Kindle, where this is not the case and hence they are way cheaper. This will turn out to be interesting ;) &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So yes, I think they are adding a bit much to the price of the books, but it still makes the books cheap by German standard. You need to remember that they are launching this in 100 countries though AT&amp;T and AT&amp;T is not in Germany. What AT&amp;T does have is so called roaming agreements which are normally really expensive. Hence, downloading a book is more expensive. The added benefit from this comes to us in point Number 3.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Number 3: I can use the Kindle anywhere. Boarding a flight to London, download a few samples, buy the book when in London before flying back. All possible, with no price changes, as this is already prices in through global roaming fees. Just think about the changes coming with that. You no longer need to decide which books to buy before holiday and which to take with you. You load up samples wherever you are, buy whenever you want, and thinking about news papers &#8230; they come to your Kindle no matter which country you are in!!! &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This thing will sell like hot-cakes and change the way you consume news and books. Period. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So here again is my affiliate link ;) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?tag=olivthylsthou-20">Buy the Kindle International Version</a>!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;P.S.: I am not even talking about the social aspects that are surely coming to the device soon.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;This is getting really scary. First caught Nokia&#8217;s latest acquisition via Martin&#8217;s post: <a href="http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/general/nokia-buys-plum.html">Nokia buys Plum</a>. Actually that headline is not really true though as once again Nokia is buying certain assets from Plum, as visible in <a href="http://www.nokia.com/press/press-releases/showpressrelease?newsid=1340931">Nokia&#8217;s press release on the Plum acquisition</a>. To quote: &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nokia and Plum today announced that Nokia has acquired &lt;strong&gt;certain assets&lt;/strong&gt; of Plum Ventures, Inc, a privately held company which &lt;strong&gt;employed approximately 10 people&lt;/strong&gt; with main offices in Boston, Massachusetts. Plum will complement Nokia&#8217;s Social Location services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So Nokia only buys certain assets and the company employed (past tense) 10 people. As Martin notes already at least the Founder will move to Berlin. Plum themselves note that their <a href="http://pluminc.com/blog/archives/2009/09/nokia-to-acquire-plum.html">entire team will be part of Nokia&#8217;s Social Location Unit</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The part that links several things together is that people are moving to Berlin. In 2006 they bought gate5, who sit in Berlin, and then in 2007 bought Navteq for $8.1 billion to further complete their mapping solution. Then came the acquisition of <a href="http://www.nokia.com/press/press-releases/archive/archiveshowpressrelease?newsid=1229894">substantially all assets of Plazes</a> in 2008, followed by <a href="http://www.nokia.com/press/press-releases/showpressrelease?newsid=1288641">bit-side beginning 2009</a> and completed recently with the acquisition of <a href="http://www.nokia.com/press/press-releases/archive/archiveshowpressrelease?newsid=1330831">certain assets of cellity</a>. All those were either in Berlin or are moving to Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So what do we have. A company that has decided that location and social is a big part of their future. This is deeply routed in the fact that Nokia has always believed and learned that a mobile phone is something very personal. That in itself makes it social and makes location important. If you then need to move fast, have 50 billion USD in revenues and 5 billion USDs in profit in 2008, and a down economy, the moves are plain brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Plazes never really took off but had a huge geek following with most every self respecting geek world wide having an account. You see the follow up of Plazes now in <a href="http://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a>, which <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/09/04/union-square-ventures-injects-1-35m-into-foursquare/">just raised $1.35 million from Union Square Ventures</a>, the venture company that is slowly moving up the ranks to become one of the most respected VCs in the social revolution out there. This just proves that Stefan and Felix from Plazes knew what they were doing and Nokia has them on board now, next to some developers that were doing some very good early RoRs work if I remember correctly, as this was the Basis of the new Plazes. Bit-side I don&#8217;t know, but it seems to have been a 39 people development shop. For cellity they again had this interesting &quot;parts of the assets&quot; type of thing they also had with Plum. For me that sounds like a Team, buy which is really what Nokia needs. And cellity was again an all star founders team with deep knowledge in the social space.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;They need the people and the learnings they did in location aware applications (Plazes), Social Messaging and Networking over existing Networks (cellity) and now connecting intimate relationships (Plum). They need to not repeat the non-obvious but painful errors that these people did getting to where they are now and allow them to get a fresh start with a real budget. Remember Nokia sold 103 million mobile phones in the second quarter of 2009. That&#8217;s almost 13 mobile devices every second if I calculated that correctly. The firepower Nokia is putting together in Berlin is very credible and I just hope that they have good management, mentors, facilitators and others to bound them together as a team quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;As Tom Peters said, you need to destroy and start over sometimes. So now a group of people is starting over in something location aware, that connects you with your friends, via a device that is the most personal thing you carry around with yourself. They are attacking Facebook from the other side. Users using Facebook via their mobile phone are more engaged, and this is where Nokia is starting at.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;One tip: The best explanation I have up till now on the success of the iPhone is that it&#8217;s the first phone that I will pull out when waiting in a short line somewhere. I wouldn&#8217;t have done that previously. So that should be the focus. No feature has any importance if it is not used.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I am really looking forward to see this unfold, with first products and/or new acquisitions. It&#8217;s a good time of acquisitions if you have the money and it&#8217;s good to see Nokia building up its software development chops.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Update 20090923: <a href="http://bit.ly/11c2wY">And now Dopplr</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Matt Mullenweg has a great post called <a href="http://ma.tt/2009/08/starting-a-bank/">Starting a Bank</a> and I&#8217;d love it if he would think more about it. Of course having used Citibank some time ago, I know how much US banking interfaces must suck, at least compared to stuff like Comdirect. In Germany <a href="https://ficoba.fidor.de/">Ficoba</a> might actually be going down that route a little bit. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;What the focus should be is really a bank by the people for the people. Hell, make it a non profit if you have to. Many people would love to have somebody take care of their money in a transparent way. Possibly the system could even use other banks. e.g. if you want to trade stocks, you can do so but it will be handled via different systems wherever it is cheapest. Above that it would be all public what costs the bank what and you just carry that cost and add something like $5 per month just because you get everything very cheap and how no hidden costs.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then add the Mint way to give you suggestions on how to save money. There would be a lot of ways to make money and if it could be bootstrapped then you wouldn&#8217;t need to please investors. Can it possibly even be open source?&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Maybe you take two companies, like one building the first bank based on the second company that just has APIs and acts more like a VISA system. Creating a standard that any new bank can use. But there are most likely already banking services available somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Please continue thinking people. This is one market really in need of some radical changes.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Oh how I love what is currently coming out of Google. I mean <a href="http://thylmann.net/blog/2009/8/12/the-hubbub-about-pubsubhubbub.html">Pubsub Hubbub is already nice</a>, and now <a href="http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/">WebFinger</a>, with <a href="http://bradfitz.com/">Brad Fitzpatrick</a> again. Brett Slatkin seems to be in on it too and T<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/14/google-points-at-webfinger-your-gmail-address-could-soon-be-your-id/">echcrunch has a good rundown</a> on what this is about.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I still remember having used Finger (and Gopher to be exact ;)) in the early days. Especially when studying physics it was nice just taking a look at whether somebody was on his computer or something. So this is perfect to be extended to the web. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Here is a good <a href="http://www.hueniverse.com/hueniverse/2009/08/introducing-webfinger.html">intro</a> as well as an i<a href="http://www.hueniverse.com/hueniverse/2009/09/implementing-webfinger.html">mplementation guideline</a> on Hueniverse. Seems to be easy enough. It doesn&#8217;t allow for real portability but that is really why you should have your own domain anyway and give that one out and have WebFinger on your own Domain, so that you can move the underlying system around. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So another thing to monitor. Grrr&#8230;. fun stuff coming out.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;It does not exist, obviously, because perfect is different for everyone involved, but there is a great discussion going on at the moment how something as close as possible to perfect could look like. Thing biggest thing I agree with is that there should be a good template to use because these things are so freaking expensive, especially because lawyers from two different sides are payed to drag the talks along as they are paid by the hour, so you really have to have good lawyers and make sure they understand that this is about an easy deal.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I am very fortunate to have had good contracts, with wonderful investors, but I&#8217;d like to link you through the discussion because there is a lot to be learned here.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;It all started with Chris Dixon&#8217;s wonderful post on &quot;<a href="http://www.cdixon.org/?p=271">Ideal first round funding terms</a>&quot;. He says to make it work like this:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors get common stock or 1x non-participating preferred stock. That really means that if an investor invests a million for 20% and you sell the company for less than 5 million, they get their million plus dividends, and you split the rest, but if you sell for more, they can convert to common and get 20% of whatever the sale price was. While I still think common is best, I get the point here, because what Chris says and I agree, is that getting their million and then still 20% from the rest or even more (multiple liquidation preference of e.g. 3 giving them 3 million before anyone else get something) is just stupid. You are in one boat, or at least you should be. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro rata rights are fully ok too, meaning they can, if they hold 20%, get 20% of the next round to keep their 20%. This is just how this stuff works. Of course you have to understand that in a down round you might end up loosing a lot of shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Founder vesting with acceleration on change of control is really only valid if you have options. But you should be able to sell some of your holdings at some time, with everybody having a right of first refusal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That might end up costing your $10k, which should be the max. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The only thing that should be clear is that an investment contract is full of &quot;communicating pipes&quot; as one investor put it to me. A wonderful term. If they want preferred stock instead of common, the valuation goes up as their downside goes down for example. They might want a term you do not like, then something ends up in the contract they might not like. But as Chris said, it should just be a standard contract and then we can save all of us a lot of time and money.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Chris also suggests going with a law firm that knows startup financing and yes this is very important. As for board seats, which is more a US thing, you should have something like 1 investor, 1 founder, and 1 independent. Possibly make that 2/2/1. This is really something we agreed on here in the voting rights. The idea is that if all investors and one independent director say X, then X is something I as a founder should accept. Sounds harsh, and you can move that around to saying that at least one founder should agree, and then you are fully fine. Just make sure that not everyone has to agree :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Founders salaries should be at a level where the founder cannot really save money, but does not have to think about it either. If angels invest next to VCs they get the same rights excluding control rights. The other option here is to pool people. Because the thing is that it can be a pain to track down 10 angels just to do a small thing because they all have to agree. And these are busy folks. :) Options should be in the contract somewhere so it is sure what else will be distributed.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then discuss valuation and amount raised, so that you are relatively sure that you can beat your post-money valuation in a next round.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;All in all, very good points.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then comes Fred Wilson with <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/08/the-ideal-first-round-term-sheet.html">more points</a>, namely that he agrees (good :)) and that they are actually using something like this. he ads another good point: if your first contract is that simple, further rounds do not have to start complicated. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then comes Brad Feld with <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2009/08/terms-terms-and-first-round-terms.html">his post</a>. The good thing he points out is that what would be even better would be if we really had one set of documents that people agree on. Because even though templates might be similar they are always slightly different. I really hope this will happen as it would make things a lot more simpler. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Another thing would then be somewhere where investors and companies could say that they used that contract for their investment, editing only X and Y. This would mean that both investors and companies could point to it and say: they did it too, now stop arguing.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Oh how easy life would be ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Update: and while I am at it, check out this post by Fred Wilson on <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/08/milestone-based-investing.html">milestone based investing</a>. I couldn&#8217;t agree more. Especially because you end up discussing milestones in a much too early stage.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;I am a technology addict, and I love trying new things. One thing that has always been important to me is how they all work together to form a greater whole. Above that, some weeks ago, together with my Squarespace move, I decided to not have personal servers anymore. Not sure how long this will hold, but I will try. Servers at home are excluded, and &#8230; a never mind, you get the point. E.g. I love <a href="http://noserub.com/">Noserub</a>, but I will run it hosted by somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;But back to the main point. My Rememberall. There is so much stuff going on around you that you really need an infrastructure to keep yourself sane enough. It is probably easiest to understand how I use things by going through the day.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A) E-Mail:&lt;/strong&gt; To start of I check my mail, yeah, I still do, and make sure only stuff I have to answer remains. Things I can answer now, are answered, things that I want to answer later remain, and things that are ToDo&#8217;s are forwarded to my private E-Mail address at <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a> so they end up becoming (unsorted) ToDo&#8217;s. All else is archived directly through a Keyboard shortcut (thanks Mail Act-On). I say archived because all mails are in GMail and never deleted.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B) RSS:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, RSS is not dead for me yet. I use Google Reader and am very happy with it. I always read the &quot;All Items&quot; list, navigating through keyboard shortcuts. Especially on the iPhone, where I use Byline which syncs with Reader, I mark things as Favorite that I want to closer read later. If I already know that I like it but want to share it with the world, I &quot;share&quot; it potentially with note, which is automatically ending up in my Tumblr Blog at <a href="http://stuff.thylmann.net/">stuff.thylmann.net</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C) Twitter:&lt;/strong&gt; Some here, I use favorites to mark things I want to read later. I am switching clients on the Desktop but on the iPhone I end up using Tweetie, even though I tried several others. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D) <a href="http://readitlaterlist.com/">Read it Later</a>:&lt;/strong&gt; This wonderful service actually is used to add anything that I want to read later while in the browser. It includes an iPhone app that syncs via Nocat and hence I have lots of stuff to read later on my iPhone to read whenever I have the time. It also brings me to my next point. There also are two Bookmark lists for reading very shortly and reading some time, but let&#8217;s see where they end up at in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E) Remembering:&lt;/strong&gt; I leave that with <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> really. Whatever I have read and liked, whatever I think I would like to save, whatever I want to remember, it ends up in Evernote. Either through a forward in Read it Later, via a Bookmarklet or right from the Mac. And it ends up in Spotlight on the Mac too. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F) Friendfeed:&lt;/strong&gt; I am actually not sure what to od with this now. I was actually setting it up as my personal search engine. I ended up adding people I think are emm&#8230; intelligent and as they add all their personal feeds to their accounts, I presume in the long term it will/would have allow(ed) me to get very good search results. Sadly now they have been bought by Facebook so I will have to revisit Noserub again but that is against my idea of not having a server. Maybe just locally. ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G) What is missing:&lt;/strong&gt; I still need one thing that aggregates it all really. I&#8217;d like all that is being shared with notes to end up somewhere, full content, all items in evernote, all my twitter messages, all my blog posts, all my photos, whatever. It is still a little bit too distributed. But as distributed is the way of the future I am looking forward to using this setup now and re-integrating that. I am hoping for a few things for the new Social Timeline being developed by Squarespace. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So what are you using as your rememberall.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Ok, you have to love the name. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">Pubsubhubbub</a> is simply the best name for a technology for ages, period. And it is currently pitted as the better step towards a <a href="http://wave.google.com/">Google Wave</a> like future than Google Wave itself.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So what is PubSubHubbub:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A simple, open, server-to-server web-hook-based pubsub (publish/subscribe) protocol as an extension to Atom (and RSS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In longer terms, it is part of a system that removes the need for Google Reader to query my RSS feed every few hours to see if there is something new, instead allowing for Google Reader to be notified when something changes. The argument is that it gives us the live web and it decreases resource need. For a better into check out <a href="http://twit.tv/twig2">This Week in Google Episode 2</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I really like it and so does Anil Dash as visible in his post <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2009/08/what-works-the-web-way-vs-the-wave-way.html">The Web Way vs. The Wave Way</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There is just one thing that makes me wonder. I remember a long time ago when MovableType was it, with everyone arguing that it was better to have the blogging platform publish static HTML files when you published a blog post as you are publishing so few of them in relation to the traffic that the resources are better spent there. But servers got more powerful and Wordpress changed this around to say that you want easy and fast publishing, the possibility to change your design around, the switch things, which makes it better to have the publishing be dynamic. This is what I see again here. We had centralized systems and only a few of them but slowly we are getting more and we want to move around. This changes how the content should be put together. We have friends all over the place and hence on request we do not want them to come from one source but from several, which is starting to become possible due to server power and general infrastructure items like Pubsubhubbub. It&#8217;s push due to the underlying changes in how we interact with each other and what we say is important.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;We somehow want near-real-time communications. The problem I see though with Pubsubhubbub is how the technology scales if you have for example 1 million friends on twitter. With a centralized system this is relatively easy. If each of your posts needs to be published to 300.000 hubs, this starts to become a pain. But with a polling mechanism it would not be live. How much resources are we will to spend for live, and who will pay the bill?&lt;/p&gt;</p>
