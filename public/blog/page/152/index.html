  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that GarageBand, which is part of the iLife package from <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>, is getting very good reviews, at least based on the post &lt;a title=&quot;GarageBand in aller Munde&quot; href=&quot;http://fscklog.typepad.com/fsck/2004/01/garageband_in_a.html&quot;&gt;&lt;I&gt;GarageBand in aller Munde&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the german blog fscklog. Giving away the entire package of iLife at close to $50 does seem to be a very good deal, even though I still kind of consider iPhoto as part of MacOS X and do not believe the iApps should be charged seperately, at least not iTunes, iPhoto, and the like. If it gets really really high tech then maybe, but not for those. Based on the Reviews, GarageBand for $50 would be ok though.</p>

In total it will run on CNN from January 17th to 21st, costing as much as $300.000. MoveOn wants to run it on Super Bowl but this is currently not sure yet.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That&#8217;s the value of the Music on the 40GB iPod based on the New R.I.A.A.: <a href="http://www.thenewriaa.com/stats.php">check it out</a>:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;The MP3â€™s on a full 40GB iPod have a retail value of $10,000. An iPod weighs in at 160 grams, so thatâ€™s about $60 gram or approximately the street price of cocaine.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that Morgan Freeman will release his new movie on the net at the same time as it starts in the theatres. A long article about this can be found <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1025_3-5137972.html?">here</a> on News.com. (Thanks to Fred&#8217;s log for <a href="http://www.com-soft.de/mt/archives/000027.html">the pointer</a>). This is also interesting in relation to the problem that there seem to be copies of almost every screener sent to the Acadamy for review out there to be had on file sharing applications. At least based on <a href="http://www.waxy.org/archive/2004/01/14/research.shtml">this post</a> on Waxy.org. Making them available on the internet, with payment obviously, will increase or diminish that problem. I am not yet sure which way it will go.</p>

Brazil simply says that every Brazilian has to do that too when they travel to the US. A judge ordered that :) Good move if you ask me. Now an airline pilot made obszene gestures when his picture was taken. They entire crew was then arrested and now that the airline has to pay a 10.000 EUR penalty for that. :)

<time datetime="2004-01-14T16:18:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 14<span>th</span>, 2004</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that TAC (Traffic Acquisition Costs) for Overture (now part of Yahoo!) has been growing steadily due to increased competition in the market. This comes from <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1030-5140499.html">an article</a> about the release of Yahoo!&#8217;s new numbers, the first time with Overture included. The market we are talking about here is that of paid placement text links. Where did all this come from?</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>It started out with goto.com, now Overture, which had a paid search engine, with the idea that if somebody paid well for a given term, it would also be interesting for the user. Still, the site remained relatively small, unteil they decide to just place their top 3 search results on top of standard search results on other search engines, like Yahoo!, giving part of the revenue earned to those search engines. This was kind of the start of TAC. Then Google came and started (after Sponsored Listings which I will leave out) AdWords, which puts these ads (which they now are) to the right of their search results to make sure that they are seen as a seperate thing. They are still working wonderfully, especially because Google has a lot of traffic.</p>

<p>Then the hype started and Overture, Google, eSpotting, Find What, Kanoodle, &#8230; now have huge numbers of advertisers and they need to acquire more and more traffic to get a high number of clicks on the ads, which should in the end turn into sales for the advertiser. But search only produces that much traffic. This is where it turned out that you could start something is called contextual ads. There are different approaches here. One would be, used by Google, to read a web site automatically and then find an allgorithm to decide what the page is about, then displaying ads on it as if users searched for what the page is about. This is reasonable ok and still relatively content targetted, even though the user is not longer in &quot;search mode&quot;, which increases conversion, arguably. What others do, is simply decide what the page is about and then put links on there in relation to the keyword that was decided for that page.</p>

<p>Suddenly their reach grew immensely and you will now see Google banners all over the net, even possibly making Google one of the biggest advertisers on the internet (<a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2003/10/contextual_ads.html">more here</a>). The reach is immense, but they need more. Google now has over 150.000 Advertisers and they all want lots of (good) traffic. So everyone wants to be on the good sites (<a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2003/10/google_adwords.html">Google now even bought Sprinks</a>, arguably to get in About.com).</p>

<p>To get their placements in those sites, the good ones, they pay out % of their revenues, in different kinds of ways and this is why the TAC grows, and their margin will think to almost nothing, unless somebody is considerably better at optimizing the ads than somebody else. And then the question comes in what optimization is, for clicks or for sales? For the advertiser it&#8217;s sales but for the likes of Google and Overture it&#8217;s clicks. And this is where the quality question comes in. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s here. The Nokia 6600 has finally arrived and I am happy to say that I love it. Syncing via iSync and the iBook worked without a problem after copying the 3650 configuration files and changing the settings from 3650 to 6600. I presume it will work out of the box with the next update, especially as the 6600 seems to be selling very well indeed. So now I have all my contacts (including images!!!) on the phone, I have MMS and GPRS set and already sent out an image via eMail. More playing with the phone will be going on this evening and I will be trying to sum up some of my findings and give some pointers to cool applications out there for Series 60 and Symbian 7.0! Stay tuned!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>FastCompany has a very good article about innovation at Apple entitled: <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/78/jobs.html">&lt;i&gt;If He&#8217;s So Smart&#8230;Steve Jobs, Apple, and the Limits of Innovation&lt;/i&gt;</a>. What they are talking about is that Apple is a very very innovative company, but their innovation runs mostly in terms of technology, new products, which on its own does not create economic value. As Apple is so innovative, by normal standards, Apple should be amazingly profitable and huge, but they are not.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>In general they are correct but I have to admit that Apple seems to be going the right way in many ways in attracting the niche they are targetting. Yes, they only have a small market share, but that market share works. They control the entire idea of owning a Mac and that&#8217;s what they need. By controlling the entire value chain, especially the part touched by the consumer, they can make sure that they get a good experience. Yes, Microsoft is very profitable, but people hate the products they build (in a lot of cases, and at least in relation to Apple, so no flames please ;)).</p>

<p>Apple might not be so profitable, but that really depends on how you measure profit. If you want to build the most innovative computer company out there, that builds great products and is loved by it&#8217;s customers, then that company might just not be as profitable as the next one. But is that bad? Nope. It just needs to be clear to everyone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A big part of the entire finance course is choosing which projects to do and which not to do. A lot of why they should be done banks on the idea of ROI (Return on Investment) as measured by NPV (Net present value) or other means. Frank Scavo, The Enterprise System Spectator, has a very good post entitled <a href="http://fscavo.blogspot.com/2003_12_01_fscavo_archive.html#107255959096298847">Escaping the ROI Trap</a> about how a pitch for a project should be undertaken. This one fits very well with the course, adding another small but valid dimension to it all.</p>
