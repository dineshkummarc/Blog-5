  <div class="entry-content"><p>Again a best seller that just came to by attention again recently when <a href="http://www.hebig.com/">Heiko</a> posted about it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385504209/bizkiffer-20">The Da Vinci Code</a> by Dan Brown is an amazing book&#8230;</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>&#8230; when you start the first page you will hardly manage to stop reading. With each page you will be a little closer to the truth and want to find out more, have more answers and more question and learned more things about secret cults and societies. The characters are laid out marvelously and the plot twists and turns. I can without a doubt put this one on the same level as Neal Stephenson&#8217;s Cryptonomicon and can only suggest it to anyone, especially if you are just a tiny bit interested in church, opus dei, secret society, art, code breaking, history, &#8230; there is so much in there you can&#8217;t put it down in one page.</p>

<p>Wondering what I should write about this without giving it away, I will just stop and tell you to buy the book. Happy reading.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I heard about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743260244/bizkiffer-20">Against all Enemies</a> by Richard A. Clarke via <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/products.html">Technorati&#8217;s BookTalk</a>, which lists the books that the blogging community is currently reading. When it was introduced, &lt;i&gt;Against all Enemies&lt;/i&gt; was at the top, having already been sold out on Amazon and not even having arrived at Amazon.de. I thought it was a book I should read and so I ordered it once it came out. It&#8217;s an amazing book&#8230; following are a few more thoughts on it.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>The book is an account of Richard A. Clarke and how he saw America&#8217;s war on terror from the inside, as the sub headline already gives away. Very importantly he starts by saying that this is his personal account, written by himself and there might be other views of the things that happened. But he can only recount the things that happened how he saw it and this needs to be remembered when you read the book. This is somebody that is very knowledgable of terrorism and the inner workings of the US government and secret service organisations, but at the same time he might have been following terrorism too harshly. This isn&#8217;t a one sided thing in which you either support his cause of work against terrorism or you don&#8217;t. There are a multitude of things a state needs to do at any time and some just believed other things to be more important. He was proven right that terrorism was very important, but with hindsight that is always easy.</p>

<p>You will read some weird things that happened and you will appreciate they background to why the US is stationed where it is stationed and why they supported which state and why it was seemingly the right thing to do at the time. His words are conculsive and I agree on the big picture of it. If you are able to step back and think about potential other viewpoints then this book will be an amazing source of learning!</p>

<p>He finishes the book with some ideas of how al Qaeda might be defeated and one little sentence springs to mind as having the most importance:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;To defeat that [al Qaeda] enemy and prevent it from achieving its objectives, we need to do mor ethan just arrest and kill people. We and our values needed to be more appealing to Muslims than al Qaeda is.&lt;/I&gt; - Richard A. Clark</p>

<p>His other views are important too but I will leave those to the book for those interested. Take it as another side of the story, one that has not been told enough. There is not enough discussion about all of this and Clarke agrees it seems. He was just getting too weak to fight this war of words on his own. There was too little support in the higher ranks.</p>

<p>A sad picture of the US government is painted here and we will see where all this leads.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a previous post I looked at the <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/05/google_xls_and_.html">revenue coming in for Google via AdSense</a>.  As of that post $341 Million come in via AdSense. This is for 3 months, so let&#8217;s devide that by 3, leading to arround $111 Million, just to have a nice number. How much does Google make as CPM on those ads?</p>

<p>&lt;pre&gt;
CPM            Total Revenue             Ads Delivered
$1               $111,000,000              111,000,000,000
$2               $111,000,000              55,500,000,000
$3               $111,000,000              37,000,000,000
&lt;/pre&gt;</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s just presume $2, then that over 55 Billion Ads delivered. With 4 Text Links Average on those Banners that&#8217;s 220 Billion Text Links delivered. In one month. That&#8217;s what I call reach. It might just be half that if they really make $4 CPM or more on their entire network, but still, these are huge numbers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Where will you host your next web site? Might as well be Google! At least if you follow the reasoning by John Battelle <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/000653.php">here</a>. Google last month bought <a href="http://www.ignitelogic.com/index.php">Ignite Logic</a>, a company that allows law firms to easily set up web sites. I think they just made AdWords survivable. Hmmmm&#8230;..</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: Ah well. <a href="http://www.ignitelogic.com/">ignitelogic.com</a> now only serves an image. Nothing more. The php file linked above gives a server error. This might be a temporary problem or Google didn&#8217;t want us to know what they are doing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I might have found my harddisk video recorder. Starting May 21st, the <a href="http://www.tv-server.de/content/pvr/index.htm">Fast Personal Video Recorder PV 100</a> will be sold for â‚¬555 (â‚¬499 at Lidl) will be sold in Germany including a <a href="http://www.tvtv.de/cgi-bin/WebObjects/EPG.woa">TVTV</a> subscription for 60 days. With the subscription you can program the video recorder remotely via the TVTV website without the need for a DSL connection. It will work simply via the standard cable and that for only 55EURs per year. It can then similar to TiVo record your preferred shows and or the important bits of the European Football Championship on it&#8217;s 80gig harddisk. Very nice I have to say. And the price seems to be at least ok.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kevin Werbach&#8217;s <a href="http://werbach.com/blog/2004/05/05.html#a1477">post on VoIP</a> is making the rounds, or rather his quote of Michael Powell, chairman of the FCC, said about VoIP at a cable industry trade show:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;&quot;If you&#8217;re a big incumbent and you&#8217;ve sort of enjoyed a competitive advantage &#8230; you, in my opinion, ought to be terrified.&quot;
[&#8230;]
&quot;I think it&#8217;s going to be the very, very best and biggest breakthrough in our ambitions and dreams about competition ever.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Let me, for emphasis sake, repeat the first sentence which is just plain wonderful:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;&quot;If you&#8217;re a big incumbent and you&#8217;ve sort of enjoyed a competitive advantage &#8230; you, in my opinion, ought to be terrified.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Kevin adds a few points to this <a href="http://werbach.com/blog/2004/05/05.html#a1477">his post</a>. All in all, this is a very powerful point and something why I might even remotely think about investing in the german company <a href="http://www.freenet.de/">Freenet.de</a>. They are moving into VoIP in a big way and in a good way and with SIP phones comes out and SkyPe getting some attention, all this stuff could really take off. Could. Would. Maybe. But still. Did I already mention that there is a SkyPE client for the PocketPC? I think there is even one for my Nokia 6600. If I had a GPRS flatrate I might even be able to do some free calling. ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, stuff is getting a little bit clearer, and more scary. First of all, John has <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/000644.php">linked to</a> an <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/Google%20Model%2005.01.04.xls">XLS file of Google&#8217;s financials</a> done by <a href="http://www.nbccableinfo.com/insidenbccable/networks/cnbc/prog/people/johnson.html">Corey Johnson</a>.</p>

<p>A very interesting bit came up in the comments to his post though. Saul Hansell pointed the following bit out from the S-1 filing:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;The Company&#8217;s net revenues and cost of revenues would both have been $91.7 million and $504.0 million and $69.7 million and $262.6 million higher in 2002 and 2003, and in the three months ended March 31, 2003 and 2004, if these AdSense agreements had been accounted for on a gross basis. There were no AdSense agreements in 2001.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>This means that google is reporting only the revenues available to them, not those paid out to others. Now this got me thinking a little bit. As I just <a href="http://www.furl.net/">furled</a>, there is some discussion about <a href="http://www.seroundtable.com/archives/000415.html">revenue shares from AdSense</a> which might be in the high 70% for the partners.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at the numbers above again. But first lets look at something else.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;We provide advertising, web search and other services to members of our Google Network. The net revenues generated from the fees advertisers pay us when users click on ads that we have delivered to our Google Network membersâ€™ web sites represented approximately 15% of our net revenues in 2003, and approximately 21% of our net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2004, and we expect this percentage to increase in the future.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take the March 31, 2004 numbers. Of the &lt;i&gt;net&lt;/i&gt; revenues 21% came from partners. 95% of their revenues were from advertising. That&#8217;s about $370 Million. 21% of that is from AdSense partners. This means $292 Million comes from Google&#8217;s own sites. That&#8217;s $78 Million. As stated above by Saul, to get real revenues we need to add back $263 Million. That&#8217;s a total via AdSense of $341 Million.</p>

<p>This gives us totally different numbers:
1. Google Pockets roughly 23% of their revenue via AdSense, payout out 77% to partners. I presume that some of the big ones get more than that and the normal AdSense pulls that down a bit again.
2. 54% of Google&#8217;s Revenue come from AdSense. This really means that 54% of the power that Advertisers pay for, currently comes in via AdSense. This is likely to grow.
3. 41% of their revenue is paid out to partners. And with the above revenue share, this will grow, presumeing AdSense growths faster than Google sites.</p>

<p>Some very interesting numbers I have to say.</p>
