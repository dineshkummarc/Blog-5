  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a very good first day at Les Blogs and I had some wonderful chats with people and am looking forward to more on day two. The panels are already starting well. The party, given to us with an open bar by <a href="http://www.edelman.com/">Edelman</a> (thanks!), was at a very nice venue and I&#8217;d call it a success, even though they were out of beer at 21:30!!! They were out of beer! Ok, maybe because we are in Paris we should drink wine anyway, but that probably made it more expensive for Edelman as people started drinking Vodka Tonic and other things. Probably a supply side problem, but still very weird. Sadly the party didn&#8217;t last too long and it was emptying out around midnight, and I was thrown out with the last 2 people at 1:30 am.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/06122005043.jpg">&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; vspace=&quot;4&quot; hspace=&quot;4&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;Les Blogs 2.0 Party&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.thylmann.net/06122005043-tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;</a></p>

<p>It&#8217;s already nice to see that this day starts out with more discussion and more diverse opinions and it is not all shiny anymore. Will become a good day. Oh, and you notice that it&#8217;s a geeky crowd, with a quick scan giving me more than 20 different bluetooth devices that all have a real name. :)

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is what Jeff Clavier called this. In general the call they call their session &quot;The good, the bad and the ugly.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/05122005037.jpg">&lt;img width=&quot;133&quot; vspace=&quot;4&quot; hspace=&quot;4&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;Investing 2.0&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.thylmann.net/05122005037-tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;</a></p>

<p>It starts with the definition of Web 2.0, which is simply the next generation of the web. Easy enough really. There is a real problem with the presentation from Jeff&#8217;s laptop. Jeff really believes that Bootstrapping goes a long way now and you can go to a million users with a million of dollars. A good exit road is the GYM, which are the large buyers out there, Google Yahoo! and Microsoft. Founders he believes will make the most amount of money in this web 2.0 world, as there are a lot of companies that will possibly range money from Angel but never have to go to VCs. Angels will look for an investment of $100k to $1 million, with $5-20 million being possible with VCs.</p>

<p>Jeff needs to decrease his screen resolution and he just moved to a mac so he doesn&#8217;t know how. Technorati&#8217;s own comes for help and now we can finally see the presentation. :)</p>

<p>Om Malik can&#8217;t be here, but there is a video that is shown. The good is that companies that make tools that people want and that are providing infrastructure. The bad is that there are a lot of me too companies that are being founded and everybody is banking on being bought out. Actually very nice to see he is almost here.</p>

<p>Rodrigo Sepulveda believes the energy is back, which is good. There is some good funding going on in Europe. The bad is a lack of ambition, with a lot of people just wanting to be sold. The ugly is that there is a lot of copy and paste.</p>

<p>Jeff Clavier thinks the good is that the vibe is back and that there are lots of people in there. He has the right US mind in that lots of people will fail but they will learn and start again, which is something that Europe or at least Germany still needs to build up.</p>

<p>David Hornik says that entrepreneurs are interested in the consumer internet again, which is the great new for him. The bad news at this moment in time the GYM isn&#8217;t yet at the stage where they are paying huge and crazy amounts for companies. The ugly would be when that comes back, which is when it would turn ugly. Businesses need to work out to be a real going concern.</p>

<p>I sadly got distracted when Simon from Yahoo! was talking. Typically Yahoo!, he does say that one of the bad things is that there is not yet an universal login system, meaning that you can target your ads a lot better on blogs because you really know the user. Of course Yahoo! is really doing just that, and he believes there are not enough ambitious companies.</p>

<p>David talks about buying a new recording device to allow him to podcast. He is very excited about blogging, podcasting and videocasting and he really does look for a good group of people who have a really great long-term vision and will build a big company. He has seen that in blogging and not in the rest yet.</p>

<p>In the discussion it came up that David believes that there might be a funding bubble on the horizon as there are a lot companies out there that might not have a viable business or exit strategy. We don&#8217;t have a public market bubble yet.</p>

<p>Heiko Hebig asks what the next big thing will be, especially in light of so many me-too companies being funded. The panel seems to be pretty sure that Video will be something that will move with force to the web. Asking Simon from Yahoo! to talk about Flickr a bit, he denies to say what they paid for it. Jeff then smilies saying everyone knows and puts up a few fingers being interpreted as a 27 :), but then David seems to say it was less.</p>

<p>A million square foot in LA, is what Yahoo! rented recently based on Marc Canter and he wishes them good luck and would love to see some multimedia out of there. Marc actually asks about the new open Yahoo!, which he believes they are using this openness as their weapon against Google.</p>

<p>Next item is the question of Mechanical Turk from Amazon and what they think about it. David is a bit skeptical, and believes that people might value their time higher than what people might pay for it, especially in terms of things like Mechanical Turk.</p>

<p>Rodrigo talked about that there are companies out there that haven&#8217;t ever taken VC funding, like Spreadshirt who are now 100 people and profitable. David agrees that people don&#8217;t have to take his money, as he might be a nice guy at meetings, but not nice enough for the amount of share of the company he takes away for that. :)</p>

<p>Some more questions and answers that I didn&#8217;t write down, but all in all a great panel.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>John reports about <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002064.php">Tivo Bringing Search to Ads</a> and I think this is something that will grow a lot in the next few years. All we need is a little back channel from the TV and things are starting to be put together to enable us to do just that. <a href="http://www.visibleworld.com/">Visible World</a> is a good example on how to have variable ads shown on TV based on different inputs, and one of that might really be performance of the ads in a relatively timely manner. If you take something like <a href="http://vision.t-online.de/">T-Online Vision</a>, which allows you to get Films over your broadband connection, then you are starting to have a system where people can click links for follow ups or even give their personal data to get more information via a form. This could even be done automatically if their contact data is available in the system.</p>

<p>How could this look like? I am a big advertiser that want to give people a chance to experience my product first hand, with a nice prospectus going out before the product hits the stores and the option to buy right from my online store before public availability. The advertising backend will show me what kind of tags users use to save their shows, what they save and what they see on their TV. I might even know what they search for in general or what they have booked for their next viewing pleasure. Through this I can find my most fitting customers. A targeted ad to those people, with an easy way to give their contact data to be called and sent further information, will likely work very well. I could even adapt the ad over time to only have those ads running that perform really well based on Taguchi and other analysis. This is how all this will evolve and I am looking forward to it indeed. Now we analyse click streams, in the future also view streams.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Great article on Web Guerrilla entitled <a href="http://www.webguerrilla.com/checkbook-seo/click-fraud/">The Truth About Click Fraud</a>. In general the idea is good and I am looking forward to the numbers but the click-bot thing points at something even more scary. Imagine coupling that with a virus that replicated along thousands and thousands of machines. It could be set-up to give out a perfect IE header info when clicking, and run clicks on random sites by surfing around and simply clicking from time to time. The bots could even talk to each other telling themselves what kind of sites to target, at best the biggest sites out there which it could even find via Alexa for example.</p>

<p>Due to its randomness, and the problem that it ends up to be not any different than a normal user, I  really don&#8217;t know how it would be filtered out. This would not really make anyone money, but it would just bring down the providers.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>John Battelle has a very nice article entitled <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002072.php">Thinking About Google and The Turning Point</a> and I can relate. I still remember when Microsoft came out with Passport and what all the rage was. Now we are a lot more quiet and it is getting weird what kind of stuff I happily have on Google. Google tracks my web site (not for long, as it&#8217;s not good for a blog, more on that another time), handles my ads, does my eMail, is my search, runs small adwords campaigns for me (did run very big ones at my previous job and will likely again), has my account at Google Answers (and even gave me a blanket for being a researcher from the start :)), a bit of my network in Orkut, tracks me wherever there are AdSense ads, &#8230; the list could go on. Remember DoubleClick? When they bought a company that would potentially connect their clickstreams to personal identifiable data, all hell broke loose. HELLLOOOOOOO!!! Google has AdSense, the biggest advertising network ever invented, because it is a sales network and because its integrated effortless and works to a good degree.</p>

<p>Whenever they you see a Google ad, they know what it should be about, what the time of day is, what your country and provider is, what kind of conversion some of the ads have in the ad, what you search for when not surfing around, that you get lots of eMails (they likely don&#8217;t &quot;know&quot; what you get as eMail), and lots more stuff. So all in all Google is really approaching a size that makes it sound like the player out there but hey, you can switch. Go somewhere else. Things are hotting up out there and it will only get more interesting.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We haven&#8217;t really announced our company yet, and already people searched for the company on <a href="http://www.openbc.com/">OpenBC</a>. I got somebody on my profile from <a href="http://www.quotatis.com/">Quotatis</a> via a search for &quot;Ormigo&quot;, the name of the new company. Quotatis is a french site that allows individuals to get offers from 3 different merchants on a given subject allowing you to choose the best one. Congratulations for the <a href="http://www.pme.gouv.fr/mde/e_tic/tic3/quotatis.html">2 Million in funding</a>. Also, <a href="http://www.henninglange.com/">Henning</a> got called already by another entrepreneur to ask what we are doing based on his blog post. (Update: 2 people ;))</p>

<p>Ormigo is the name of our company we are currently setting up by the way, but you probably have guessed that already.</p>

<p>(Update: That person seems to have searched for some subjects, probably dropped by one of Henning&#8217;s posts, then searched on OpenBC, found the company name, &#8230; :))</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; technorati tags start &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Technorati Tags: &lt;a rel=&quot;tag&quot; href=&quot;http://www.technorati.com/tag/OpenBC&quot;&gt;OpenBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;tag&quot; href=&quot;http://www.technorati.com/tag/Ormigo&quot;&gt;Ormigo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;tag&quot; href=&quot;http://www.technorati.com/tag/Quotatis&quot;&gt;Quotatis&lt;/a&gt;</p>
