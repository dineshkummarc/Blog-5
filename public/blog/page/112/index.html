  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently got introduced to <a href="http://mgoldberg.typepad.com/occams_razor/">Marc Goldberg&#8217;s Blog</a> via <a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/">Loic</a> and soon came to ask a question how some of the higher values, especially of companies that are barely profitable, in take-overs comes from. Soon thereafter he he posted the folloing: &lt;a title=&quot;Where are company valuation coming from ?&quot; href=&quot;http://mgoldberg.typepad.com/occams_razor/2004/09/where_are_valua.html&quot;&gt;Where are company valuation coming from ?&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a great insight and again shows that you need to do your valuations in context. For VCs that means that they need an exit strategy and that&#8217;s what the valuation is geared to. Very nice indeed. Thanks Marc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Heiko <a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/002494.shtml">posted about</a> <a href="http://www.shell.de/drive/">Shell Drive</a>, which is very similar to the DB Bikes you see in lots of cities in Germany really. The idea is that you get a special keycard, simply call a special number to get a car, pick it up (with your keycard), drives an hour around town to pick something up, give the car back, done. You pay by the hour and kilometer and it seems that it&#8217;s cheaper than having a car as long as you drive less than 10k Kilometers per year. All insurance and petrol are of course included. It&#8217;s a very nice idea I&#8217;ll look forward to using. When I recently wanted to pick up a car at Sixt, it took 1 hour because their PCs kept on crashing.</p>

<p>Heiko goes on with an interesting idea though. Petrol to cars is like ink to printers. You make money on the ink, not on the printers. The problem with this that you will have to make sure that the car can only pick up gas at that exact station chain. You might get stuff like Cash Group in banks here where you can get money out of cashing machines for free in a group of banks&#8230; that might be the direction. What you do is you sell gas cheaper at Shell for people who have a Shell Car.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to the new TypePad styles, I now have a new moblog which is no longer a TypePad photo album but a real blog. You can find it at <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/moblog/">owt.typepad.com/moblog/</a> and it even has an RSS feed. Now that it&#8217;s so much cleaner and better working I no longer have to decide where to moblog to, which means I will likely do it more often. That means I am not at three blogs really. This one, the <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a> (summaries of my MBA studies) and my <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/moblog/">Moblog</a>. Another one is in the works but that takes some time :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This weekend is bound to be interesting. I just <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/002552.html">read on Jeremy Zawodny&#8217;s blog</a> that FOO Camp 2.0 is starting this weekend. Next to Web 2.0 another one I&#8217;d like to be at. Thank god for bloggers ;)</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: The wonderful Russel Beattie has set up <a href="http://3gp.us/">FooTV</a>, which will be a moblogged video feed of the event &#8230; kind of. Cool :)</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update 2&lt;/b&gt;: We need directional mics on mobile phones or stuff like FooTV won&#8217;t make it. You can&#8217;t understand a thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been playing with <a href="http://www.21publish.com/">21Publish</a> for a bit now, after I got a mail from <a href="http://www.tjacobi.com/">Torsten Jacobi</a> some time back to have a go at it. What is it? It&#8217;s a self-serve hosting platform I&#8217;d say. You can get your blog platform based on <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a> or <a href="http://www.blogg.de/">Blogg.de</a> (not sure, I presume) and others, but the difference with 21Publish is that you get it in a self-serve manner. You sign up, and get a management interface for an entire platform, which allows you to give other people the option to sign-up for a blog within your platform easily. The first six months at the moment are free, so try it out. In the end, 100 users with 25 MB will be under $90, a very reasonable price I&#8217;d say (but I admit that I don&#8217;t know the others services prices).</p>

<p>The interface seems to be very powerful, with things like moblogging for users, hosting of pictures, and the option for templates for the management blog as well as for user blogs, limitable to those you want to allow (system set or your own). You also have a nice nested category system for all the stuff you will post to the management blog as well as statistics. You can also easily send a mail to all your users in a newsletter type system. Of course, RSS can be enabled for all users and you of course can point everything to a domain of your choosing.</p>

<p>Overall, a nice feature set for groups who want to set up their own blogs. I can already see this as a very nice thing for a football club to setup their own blogging platform, or for smaller companies to get their employees or customers to blog.</p>

<p>You could probably do all that with MovableType or a lot of other apps, but this one is a hosted and supported service. If you are thinking about getting a group of people blogging, I suggest you give it a look. There is also a German version at <a href="http://www.21publish.de/">21Publish.de</a> and sadly the admin login is dependent on the domain you choose, but that shouldn&#8217;t be a real problem unless you want to put multilanguage systems on there.</p>

<p>I suggest you take a look and decide for yourself if this is for you. It&#8217;s really worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The next <a href="http://www.changethis.com/">ChangeThis</a> Issue came into my inbox recently, and one thing I started reading swiftly was Al Gore&#8217;s speach entitled <a href="http://www.changethis.com/3.UnbalanceOfPower">Unbalance of Power</a>. It&#8217;s an interesting perspective of what is currently going wrong in the US, with war and things only being symptoms.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;&quot;I am calso convinced that they [the founders] would warn us that democracy itself is in grave danger if we allow any president to use his role as commander in chief to rupture the careful balance between the executive, legislative and judicial branche of government.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>In relation to terrorists he adds &quot;&lt;I&gt;their overall numbers seem to have grown considerably because our invation of the country that did not pose any imminent threat to us was perceived in their part of the world as a gross injustice.&lt;/I&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>An interest fact comes from him in relation to Abu Ghraib. He tells a story about a kid on a kind of student exchange in Spain, who called his dad asking if the stuff about what happened in the prison was correct. The father said that it&#8217;s not true and that he does not know what is on the TV over there in spain, but it&#8217;s not true. He later, yes later, when it finally appeared on TV in the US, that he was wrong. He couldn&#8217;t be believe it. &lt;I&gt;&quot;But the fact that others around the world saw these pictures before we did is itself an issue that runs to the core of important concerns about the course of our democracy.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Interesting read all in all.</p>
