When studying the last two courses, Certificate and Diploma in Management, I found out that I would probably not have done as well if I would have started two years earlier. Now I just read that you &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to be 27 to start the MBA at the OU. Well, good luck for me that I now am 27 then. It really felt good to be 27 just now ;)</p>

There are three more parts it seems. Let&#8217;s what they bring.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Up until now I was using <a href="www.feedreader.com">Feedreader</a> to keep up to date with lots of different sites via their rss/rdf feeds (e.g. <a href="http://www.ennead.de/blog/index.rdf">mine</a>). I love it, because it makes &quot;surfing&quot; so much less time consuming and just tells you when there is something new going on somewhere. I also think that it is very good for the sites themselves as they keep me as a potential visitor by letting me automatically check for updates. I would go to the 30 or more sites I now check each day. Having their feeds makes it easy to stay up to date about what they say, both in terms of news sites and the many interesting blogs out there.</p>

<p>The thing is though, that feedreader seems to be killing my <a href="http://nocat.net/">nocat</a> connection, most likely because it is sending oodles of requests out when it updates 30 sites at once. At least that&#8217;s my guess because since I stopped using it, the connection to the D-Link wireless router works just fine. This would explain why it did not crash when I was using the mac. ;)</p>

<p>I was looking for a new way to get my daily, or hourly, newsfix when I found <a href="http://www.jmagar.com/">MyHeadlines</a>. It&#8217;s a web-based system that let&#8217;s me make a set list of rss feeds available to anyone with a browser. Everybody can then add their favorite feeds to their personal page and check the news from there. All feeds are updated once an hour at the moment, which isn&#8217;t too frequent but I want to check the bandwidth usage first. I also still need to add some more sites to the list. I am not too happy with the categorisation with of the available feeds at the moment but that will improve. The list will also grow and it will enable me to always have those feeds with me.</p>

<p>Some other nice features of the system are that you can search over all the feed data you have, as well as display the most clicked items and the most recent updates. Plain wonderful. Now I am just wondering why I can&#8217;t get e.g. <a href="http://joi.ito.com">joi ito&#8217;s blog</a> in there. Some sites just seem to not work. Blocking on their part? Error in the rdf file? Problem in MyHeadlines? Not sure yet.</p>

<p>And before I forget, if you want to check it out (and keep using it of course ;)), go <a href="http://www.ennead.de/rss/">here</a>. I didn&#8217;t design anything arround it yet but that will come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just got this from the TMF Boards. As they are only for paying members, I&#8217;ll paste this here instead of linking to it.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;True Story At Denver Airport</p>

<p>A crowded United Airlines flight was canceled. A single agent was
re booking a long line of inconvenienced travelers. Suddenly an angry
passenger pushed his way to the desk. He slapped his ticket on the counter and said &quot;I HAVE to be on this flight and it has to be FIRST CLASS.&quot; The agent replied, &quot;I am sorry, sir. I&#8217;ll be happy to try to help you, but I&#8217;ve got to help these folks first, and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be able to work something out.&quot;</p>

<p>The passenger was unimpressed. He asked loudly, so that the passengers
behind him could hear, &quot;DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO I, AM&quot; Without hesitating, the agent smiled and grabbed her public address microphone, &quot;May I have your attention please, &quot; she began, her voice heard clearly throughout the terminal. &quot;We have a passenger here at Gate 14 WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHO HE IS. If anyone can help him find his identity, please come to Gate 14.&quot;</p>

<p>With the folks behind him in line laughing hysterically, the man glared at the United agent, gritted his teeth and swore &quot;F*** You!&quot;. Without flinching, she smiled and said, &quot;I&#8217;m sorry, sir, but you&#8217;ll have to get in line for that too.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I now completed a first simple step to be able to read this blog with an xHTML compliant mobile phone. Going to <a href="http://www.ennead.de/blog/mobile.php">mobile.php</a> will give you a simply formated output of the last 5 posts. You will also be able to use this with <a href="http://www.avantgo.com/">Avantgo&#8217;s Consumer Service</a> in case you want to stay about to date about my life on the go. What I need to see is how I can get MovableType to build dynamic content, so I could do stuff like &quot;back 5 posts&quot; without needing a template for it. But I am just at the start of abusing MovableType.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just caught this on Joi Ito&#8217;s blog. &lt;a title=&quot;Joi Ito&#8217;s Web: Shure E5c - I&#8217;m in sound heaven&quot; href=&quot;http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/01/shure_e5c_im_in_sound_heaven.html&quot;&gt;Shure E5c - I&#8217;m in sound heaven&lt;/a&gt;. After looking at their <a href="http://www.shure.com/earphones/eseries_e5c.asp">web site</a> I have to admit that it sounds very reasonable. Having played the drums I know how wonderful it can be for the sound to cancel out all sound coming not from the music you hear via the headphones. Shure knows what they are doing in this field. The only thing is, they cost $499!!! A little steep for headphones for me at the moment. But I am very happy to know that the little brother costs $100 and that music technology is going in the right direction. And mind you, this means you can turn up the music less, not more. It&#8217;s not needed anymore as you don&#8217;t need to cancel out the sound coming from outside with more volume on the headset.</p>
