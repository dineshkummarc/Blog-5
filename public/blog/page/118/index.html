  <div class="entry-content"><p>that&#8217;s a term that Dan Gillmor used at a session at OSCON and Jeremy Zawodny summarised it a bit <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/002289.html">right here</a>. There are some very interesting things in there. For one, it is starting to become true that digital cameras and video cameras are everywhere, and there seems to have been a picture on some blog of debris coming back down to earth after the shuttle brake-up, that the mainstream media never carried. SARS got first published through SMS and then the story just spread. You can&#8217;t kill a story anymore. You can&#8217;t control PR. Interesting stuff. Thanks for the summary Jeremy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are some books that get your thinking going on business and this is definitely one of them, especially because it is very well balanced. Thomas W. Malone tries to push the boundaries of your thinking in the book while agreeing that not all we did previously is bad. I am now done with the book, loved it and am almost 4 pages of small writing richer, both on the book and of other subjects that popped into my head while reading this book. In short, it is highly suggested reading. If you want further info on what kind of ideas came into my head when reading the book, read on.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>First, I need to check out AES Corporation. I already learned about them some time ago, even checked out the shares, but forgot about it again. They are one of the biggest energy producers out there and are highly decentralised. Rank and file employees decide about multi-million dollar acquisitions and a group of workers invested 12 million of cash that the company had after getting some training on money markets from a consultant, even beating the internal department that does nothing else.</p>

<p>Malone argues that &quot;&lt;I&gt;When most people think about decentralization, they stop at loose hierarchies {&#8230;} decentralization as delegation of many decisions {&#8230;}. What if, instead, it [power] originated there [lower levels]?&lt;/i&gt;&quot; This sounds a bit weird, but if you really think about it, this is a totally different mind set.</p>

<p>The film industry is already very decentralized in that a film is normally made up of a big group of freelancers that just come together for a film. Some might work together more often, but that&#8217;s that. With this move to more decentralization, there was some safety that was lost though, job security if you want, and that needs to be dealt with, for which he has some suggestions which I really like.</p>

<p>Where does all this about decentralization come from? In the last few hundred years the move to centralization in countries, via kings and other things, have been reversed and democracies were born. People started to believe that they could get the economic and military benefits of centralization without giving up their freedom. Warren Bennis seems to have written an article entitled &quot;Democracy is inevitable&quot;, in which he argues that they are more efficient in surviving conditions of chronic change. This alone should give you an idea why corporations might move towards things similar to democracies.</p>

<p>The average size of firms if already declining, but then there are real giants like Manpower Incoroporated who &quot;employ&quot; (if you can say that they really employ anyone) 2 million people (2002).</p>

<p>What AES does, and this is where I mostly agree, is that they employ people as adults that can handle responsibility, are creative and trustworthy. Hireing is key here, especially with a cultural fit. Everyone can make decisions, but the twist at AES is that they need to get advice! This is the key part. You as a manager would not really make the decision, but you would give advice as needed. That means that there would be a lot more &quot;doers&quot; in relation to managers though, which is great. Google for example has something like 160 developers on one manager, which works as they can work freely and have very clear and simple goals. &quot;Make the search engine faster.&quot; doesn&#8217;t really need a lot more information or guiding. But in both cases, what is important is that information runs freely. Companies need to open up in some cases. Everyone sees the numbers. Everyone knows (almost) everything. AES has the &quot;problem&quot; that everybody is considered an insider in terms of stock trading now at the company, as everyone knows the key parts of the business. Employees need to know the real goals, the real monetary condition and the results of the decisions to make the right ones.</p>

<p>Managers have a different role at AES. These are:
- Advisory role
- Chief guardians of the core principles
- Giving Structure
- Picking decision makers in unclear situations</p>

<p>Salaries and advances are still in the managers hands, even though some are experimenting with letting people set their salaries themselves. But if you have both in your hand, then you still have some control. You make strategy and evaluation mechanisms clear and then you can quasi guide people in the &quot;right&quot; direction.</p>

<p>Another interesting company that I have heard about again and again is W.L Gore &amp; Associates. It is continuously one of the best to work for in the US and they have no job titles (ex secretary and president who are needed for legal reasons), everyone is an associate. To become a manager you find people that will work for you. Employees are not accountable to their manager but to their peers. These are very interesting and in my mind important ideas. I especially like the no jobtitle one, even though I am not sure how these can be implemented easily in a german company. We somehow need titles I feel.</p>

<p>Prato Textile Industry in Italy has the impannatori, a system of brokers/merchants that put together temporary mixes of corporatives for jobs that are too big for any one company. This is a really good idea I think. If you have a sales person, they can give the general specifications of a project to be done and can then kind of choose which employee to work with. Everyone knows how much time they have and if you have the right specifications and standards for describing a project, you can get everyone going on it. It would also create a filter for the seemingly interesting projects to work out. How to do that will require some rewards for working on a project, maybe the EVA of each project could be attributed to an employee and have an effect in their bonus calculation. Resources could be attached to people. Somebody could manage a given marketing potential and again, get an EVA on that and a bonus in relation to it.</p>

<p>This brings me to security again, even though shortly. Guilds might revive and this will be something some friends of mine will love to hear. Malone even mentions the potential for always open club houses for mixing and mingling with different people for whatever reason. Boy do I love that idea.</p>

<p>A nice suggestion Malone has is that you have both Project and People managers. So for a project, the Project Manager would need to talk to the People Manager to try to get the right people for the job. The only reason for existance of the people manager would be to make sure that the people are happy, prodictive, on the best jobs, performing well, &#8230; .</p>

<p>Internal capacity markets could potentially take into account priority of customers needs and wants and the importance of them. This is highly interesting for me here and I will have to explore this some more. The idea is that somebody might pay more in an internal market than what he gets, clamping something off of another customers, in belief that this will be good for his EVA in the long run.</p>

<p>Judging from all this writing I really need to get down to the EVA bit to see how it can be applied on a per-person basis.</p>

<p>But it goes on. With all those self-optimization, market like management, what do you do? You focus on who to hire, who to promote and how to reward them.</p>

<p>If you let everyone run on their own, then they will need to know the dependencies of the business though, their own and the entire one. Malone has found three basic types of dependencies in his research. The most common is the move from activity to resource to another activity, being a flow. But you can also have sharing (one resource going to two activities) and fit (two activities become one resource). In the end, you need to make sure that the right thing gets done in the right place and at the right time. This is an overarching thing that is amazingly important as simple as it sounds. Right thing, right place, right time. Important. Remember. :)</p>

<p>To get the dependencies drawn up you need to creative activity maps and people will have to have a shared higher goal, which makes me wonder if this EVA bit is really good. The EVAs probably need to be independent of each other and the resulting bonus be based on the entire company profit with the EVAs being ranked among like groups of people. Still some thinking to do.</p>

<p>To get the real dependencies down, drawing up a so called deep structure is really important. This lets all the tiny steps out. Make Cars - Sell Cars. That&#8217;s all there is. This could be done on inventory or made to order or in any other way and would still have the same deep structure. You might get some examples though their <a href="http://ccs.mit.edu/ph">Process Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>Now we move on to almost the end: cultivation. Instead of controlling you need to cultivate. You don&#8217;t control what happens but you create an environment where the right things are more likely to happen than the wrong ones. You don&#8217;t exactly need to know what they are, but you are sure that it is getting in the right direction.</p>

<p>In an age of distributed leadership (as he points out) you need: visioning, sense-making, inventing, relating. All terms I have come across through the MBA and am seeing as more and more important. Especially story telling seems  to be important to get the big picture clear for everyone.</p>

<p>In a really decentralized company you will also not only appeal to what people value economically, but also to what truely matters to them. You need to put human values at the center of doing business. Especially the really good people will be able to choose where they want to work and it will then no longer be about money for them. Yes, ultimately you will need to make a profit to survive, but as long as your shareholders agree with your goals, you can make those anything you please.</p>

<p>To finished, a quote from Dennis Bakke, co-founder of AES:
&quot;We never set out to be the most efficient or most powerful or richest company in the world - only the most fun.&quot;</p>

<p>What a wonderful goal!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;I am not totally thrilled. Maybe my expectations of this book were too high, but it&#8217;s not my problem he wrote Cryptonomicon ;). Don&#8217;t take it wrong, I really like the book, but at over 900 pages, it is far too long and only the first installment of three books. Actually, it is three books, and it is volume I of the baroque cycle, which will have three volumes, each likely being 3 books again, bounding to become one. I already have volume II and make no mistake, I will read it.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>But I will just read it in steps and not try to read it in one go, and will not try to keep everything in my head. The thing is that the general story is good, the main characters are wonderful, the settings are interesting, but &#8230; there are far too many characters in general to even remotely come to grips with in a leisurely way and sometimes he goes too far in describing the surroundings or other things.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I am torn between thinking that he goes into too much detail in the book and that this level of detail is needed to go this deep into the story. Reflecting a bit on this I feel that the depth is needed indeed and he does well in doing that, but maybe I took it for too much of a leasurely book, which it really isn&#8217;t. The amount of characters would really have warranted a piece of paper where one could write down a short who&#8217;s who and who knows whom to be able to fall back on it from time to time. There were tables of the royal families of the times in there but they do not really help with all the non-noble, not-yet-noble, soon-to-be-noble, or maybe-noble people and to get them into perspective. On top of that they have too many different names and titles that keep changing and keep being added on.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Another thing that I don&#8217;t like is that while he says that it is a historical book, it is also a novel, so some things didn&#8217;t really happen as they did, meaning that you are often not sure if this is now really how things happened in history or of it isn&#8217;t. I mean he talks about Newton and other scientiest. He talks about different royals. So it&#8217;s a mixture of half-truths, that isn&#8217;t too wonderful. I likely have to do a further read into that before continuing with volume II. Somebody can gladly enlighten me as to how much is real in the book. Who really founded the MIT for example?&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I can&#8217;t really give a final verdict yet, and I will likely have to get a different mind set for reading the next book. I will also take a pen and paper next to me to keep all the characters untangled. If I then can settle how much of the books is real and how much isn&#8217;t, then I will be a happy camper. For now, it&#8217;s merely a good book but this might change once I got through all the volumes.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002932.html">this post</a> by David Weinberger I now know that Dan Gillmor&#8217;s book &lt;i&gt;We the Media&lt;/i&gt; is available <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/wemedia/book/">online as pdf</a> for free under the Creative Commons license. This is wonderful and I just downloaded the book. I will buy it in the next shop I see it in but the thing is that I am on the move and like this I already have something to read until the book is available here in Germany. It has already been put into HTML from the PDF form by the way, which you can find via David&#8217;s post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How could you save Microsoft 329000 EURs per year? <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0704e.shtml">Jeffrey Zeldman links to an article about saving Microsoft 329 terabytes of data transfer on their web site through a move to CSS layout</a> away from tables and 1x1 position pixels. Now of course the monetary number is a guess and it is likely lower because I doubt that MS pays 1EUR per GB of data transferred, but it just shows that we are talking about relatively high numbers, not that they would make a dent in Microsofts pockets, which is probably why they simply won&#8217;t change the homepage design as the hassle would cost for more than that. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sixtus <a href="http://www.sixtus.net/index/P226/">posts about</a> David Weinberger&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002909.html">video blog post</a> about the convention bloggers in relation to a <a href="http://news.com.com/2010-1028-5289475.html?tag=nefd.acpro">recent CNet article</a> that stated that they didn&#8217;t live up to all the hype. As Sixtus says, it&#8217;s great to watch and I agree with him that it is wonderful to take a look into David&#8217;s work place :) But the reasoning is also very nice and gives further insight into what blogging is about. Little things make a difference might be a good term for it. It&#8217;s not about having huge readerships but its about talking with your own voice, as is the really thing you can do when you want to do a blog really, and potentially attrackting some people and spreading an idea. The problem is that it&#8217;s beyond control. The PR department can no longer try to press a certain kind of image about their company towards journalists, as somebody will see through it and post a counter view and if it is seen as correct it will spread. Welcome to the blogging world, where we talk about the things that really matter to us.</p>

It talks about a mechanism that will allow you to get all the citations of a blog post you are currently reading. Just drag and drop this link: <a href="void(location='http://www.bloglines.com/citations?url='+escape(location.href">Bloglines Citations</a>);) to your bookmarks and you can click it to get all the citations within Bloglines tracking database of the page you are currently reading.

It&#8217;s a nice and easy read and with Japanese seeming to be a few steps in front of us in terms of mobility, some things in there could be taken as a trend for us. Where I agree with the article, and Erwin, already, is that with social meetings, or even meetings in general, being late is no longer such a problem (it&#8217;s still nice to be on time though :)) as long as you call and say that you will be late and by how many minutes.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.jamieoliver.com/">Jamie Oliver</a> is opening up a new restaurant in Amsterdam as part of his &quot;Fifteen&quot; chain, if you can call it a chain already. There is another one in London that I know off. If I remember the system correctly, then it is more or less a place for people to learn how to cook and it&#8217;s more or less run by a group of fifteen (now you know where the name comes from ;)) students who were more or less collected off the street (homeless or at least jobless).</p>

<p>Jamie has a few pictures from the graduation night of the last group of 15 from London and a quest for a general manager for the new place in Amsterdam, just if somebody is looking for a new interesting and challenging job: <a href="http://www.jamieoliver.com/diary/2004/08/02/graduation_night.php">Check it out.</a></p>
