  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, my birthday is almost over. Ahhh&#8230; here in germany that is. In the US, if I were there, I would still have my birthday for some time. Then again, in Japan it is already over. Hmmmm&#8230; :)</p>

<p>Anyway. Thank you all the people for wishing me a good birthday and also thank you to LiveJournal for their automated birthday gratulations :)</p>

<p>The day was very good. It started out nice at my girlfriends place where I got some very cool gifts including a very nice cake just for me :). And I did not expect the gifts, which are always the best. The backpack is something I really needed and I got some very cool pizza plates. Very very nice. /me very happy.</p>

<p>One of the fun things to start with was that I got a card which was for people born under my star-sign (hope that&#8217;s the right name). And it said that Monday was a good day for me (cool!) and the numbers 2 and 7 are my lucky numbers! WAY COOL! I am not into this kind of things but hey, this is just too good. And it was not a card for people born on the 2nd of July being a Monday :)</p>

<p>So the day continued very well and I even got a parking space directly in front of the house. This is <em>very</em> rare! So much for luck eh?!</p>

<p>The other gifts I got were also wonderful and especially mostly not something I expected. And this turning out so good is not something that happens every day. Again I had a wonderful time with my brother and his girlfriend and later went to dinner with them a new restaurant which was also amazing.</p>

<p>I had some kind of very tasty chicken with a spizy-tomato-jogurt sauce. Now you had small pieces of bread, in the sauce (so all filled with sauce) and the chicken above that. Really interesting. Together with the salad it was really amazing.</p>

<p>Next we played Siedler, a very cool game which my brother gave me with two extensions. We started simple without the extensions though. I WON! TWICE! Well actually not twice. Just the first time I would have won I blew it by only having won if the illegal thing I did were allowed. :)</p>

<p>In the middle some of my friends called and said he could come to the party on Saturday.</p>

<p>I really have to use the last 45 minutes of this wonderful day.</p>

<p>Hmmm&#8230; what am I doing here? :)</p>

<p>Talk to you soon.</p>

<p>Yes, you might have guessed it. The sound check for Pur (not BAP as I said yesterday) has started and the first fans have arrived. It&#8217;s still 7 hours till the concert starts though.</p>

<p>Going out to look around a bit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well. Aachen is the center of the music world (in Aachen :)) these days. Today the german singer Sasha should have been coming but he has a cough. Blah! Not that anyone in our house here really loves any of the artists comeing with all their heart, it is still fun to have these open air gigs right behind our house.</p>

<p>Sadly we cannot see the stage but only hear it.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will have BAP, another german band and only if they do not get a cold too :) We will probably barbeque on the roof to listen.</p>

<p>Thursday will be nice with Vonda Shepard, which is nice even though I already saw her in Cologne a short time ago. But this is one of the groups that will interest me the most.</p>

<p>Friday will be Scorpions. :) Boy this will be a blast and probably a lot of fun people to look at wondering around :)</p>

<p>The interesting thing is that Saturday is some weird band that I have no clue about. Hmmm&#8230; I will report back to the world and to keep my thoughts here.</p>

<p>The cool thing is that we have a beer tent in front of our window too :)</p>

<p>Oh, and I tried out skyscraper ads on Counted! today. Actually looks ok but sadly Flycast, emm.. Engage, does not have paying ads for those yet. Bummer. Would be nice. Other than that I will put Tribal Fusion on Counted! too, like I did with BeNews.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well it seems, Unisys is sorry. Really sorry for inventing the UNIVAC 1 in 1951. The full press release can be found here:</p>

<p>http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/010614/2170.html</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;Specifically, Unisys apologized for:</p>

<p>*Making it impossible for anyone to do more than five minutes&#8217; worth of work without being interrupted by an emailed joke, Top Ten list, or chain letter.</p>

<p>[&#8230;]</p>

<p>*Relegating to obscurity the smell of fresh-cut flowers because the only flowers you ever get to smell nowadays are the ones you see in online pictures when you&#8217;re ordering them to appease an irate spouse, who&#8217;s feeling neglected because you&#8217;re spending every spare minute online.</p>

<p>[&#8230;]</p>

<p>*Ending that great morning tradition of newspaper and coffee, because by the time your coffee is hot, the &#8220;news&#8217; in your newspaper is already two generations behind the online edition.</p>

<p>[&#8230;]</p>

<p>*Getting you so used to receiving responses in nanoseconds that you can no longer wait the ten seconds it takes for your microwave oven to warm up your bagel.</p>

<p>*Making it impossible for you to justify that trip to a training workshop in Cancun because all the training you&#8217;ll need is now available on your desktop.</p>

<p>*Making it possible for you to vacation in Cancun without ever losing touch with your boss back at the office.</p>

<p>*Forcing you to go through a five-minute startup routine every time your computer crashes while you&#8217;re creating a three-minute memo.</p>

<p>[ WE NEED A NEW VERSION OF BEOS DAMN IT! ]</p>

<p>*Giving SPAM a bad name.</p>

<p>[&#8230;]</p>

<p>*Making it easier for the IRS to spot discrepancies between your tax return and objective reality.</p>

<p>*Reducing your life and everything in it to a series of counterintuitive acronyms.</p>

<p>*Giving you a false sense of security regarding the spelling and grammatical accuracy of your next memo.</p>

<p>*Increasing your volume of in-mail to the point where you have to devote significant time outside of regular working hours to get through it all.</p>

<p>*Eliminating the concept of regular working hours.</p>

<p>*Providing you with the means to lose money in the stock market at an unprecedented pace.</p>

<p>*The half-dozen keystrokes you need to press for the privilege of being put on hold.</p>

<p>*All those Monday morning deadlines you didn&#8217;t know about because they were emailed to your laptop at 10:00 p.m. on Sunday.</p>

<p>*All those theater tickets you can no longer buy at the door because every seat has already been sold online.</p>

<p>*The dot.com bubble.</p>

<p>*The bursting of the dot.com bubble.</p>

<p>*The concept of multitasking.</p>

<p>*The avalanche of press releases that any company with a media directory and access to email can now generate at a moment&#8217;s notice.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once again I was woken up by:</p>

<p>&quot;Test. 1.2.3. Test. Test&#8230;&quot; today.</p>

<p>I went to club from 1am to 5:30 am yesterday and around the nice time of 10am the 3 student bands that are playing on the market today (in front of my window) started testing the sound system. at 12am the first band started and sleeping was no longer an option. What I really hate is the introduction from the singer (translated from german):</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning Aachen. If it is too loud for you, then go somewhere else.&quot;</p>

<p>Asshole! :)</p>
