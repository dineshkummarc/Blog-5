  <div class="entry-content"><p>So you are building a company? You do not have a real clue on how search engines work? You want to be able to follow the chatter about it and pitch in? &lt;a title=&quot;In the Click&quot; href=&quot;http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/0,4621,316408,00.html&quot;&gt;In the Click&lt;/a&gt; is a nice article on entrepreneur.com about Search Engine Optimization and how powerful it can be. I would like to caution a little bit because the amount of traffic greatly depends on the amount of traffic the keywords you target generate. If noone searches for the keyword then that&#8217;s that. If they do, congratulations.</p>

But the density of amazing people in relation to all the speakers is probably higher at the &lt;a title=&quot;World Business Forum&quot; href=&quot;http://www.wbfeurope.com/&quot;&gt;World Business Forum&lt;/a&gt;. They start October 19th to 20th in Frankfurt/Germany and here is the list of the speakers: Rudy Giuliani, Michael Porter, Jack Welch, Philip Kotler, Tom Peters, Stephen Covey, Helmut Kohl.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That&#8217;s what IT Facts is reporting <a href="http://www.itfacts.biz/index.php?id=P1764">here</a> and some things are especially interesting I have to say. For one with the increasing importance of a vision and strategy that everyone can buy into, the lack of capability in getting this across is frightening. The other thing that is shown there is that people want to be developed, they want to learn and get on in their lives and managers will have to find a way to develop them and potentially let them go, because there aren&#8217;t as many steps in the ladder any more. Also important is that honesty and decisiveness are valued highly in good managers. The decisiveness bit is crucial here. You have to tell the truth and tell it correctly and not wiggle yourself through things. Bad things are bad and can be said to be bad if they are really bad and not good the next day. Think of it like raising children. If you tell a kid that something is bad and how things should be handled, then they know how to behave to be valued and that will make them feel good. It&#8217;s really about creating an eco system where the ground rules are clear and relatively fixed and consistent. If you value creativity you can&#8217;t punish somebody for talking a walk or resting on the green grass in front of the office in the sun during the day. It&#8217;s a weird world out there for managers and it will only become weirder.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That&#8217;s what most people do judging by a study from <a href="http://www.thedrg.com/">Dieringer Research Group</a>, which has looked at how many of your money goes out of your pocket in the offline world only after having been influenced by something that happened online. This can be finding product information or comparing products online or something else. All in all it looks like for every $1 spent on the internet, the same person spends another $1.70 in the real world. Needs to be looked at a lot in perspective, but this becomes important if you go into performance marketing and think about who is your referred customer, because offline is likely not trackable. A little bit more about the study can be found here: <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?1003080">From Online to Offline - and &quot;On Line&quot;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Meet <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/">Jeremy Zawodny</a>! Ok, Yahoo! Search Blogger might be too little info but <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/002808.html">Jeremy desribes his new job very well himself</a>. Congratulations to the move Jeremy, and it sounds like a wonderful challenge, that can get you lots of interesting places.</p>

<p>What I really like about it is that it&#8217;s not a move to become corporate blogger. Sure, the blogging bit played a big role, but he can move a lot further beyond this and that&#8217;s something that rocks. Yahoo! seems to really go the full way to get the most out of people, fitting them to their tasks based on their preferences. This one just shows that this is true at least in some cases.</p>

<p>Looking forward to reading a lot more great posts, more searchy or not.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is actually a personal note to Jonathan Schwartz from Sun. He posted about thinking that <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/20041011#kangaroo_is_delicious">Kangaroo is Delicious</a> yesterday and I wanted to comment on that one with a short notice that Crocodile is something he has to try. Seriously, just check out <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/09/crocodile_tasts.html">my post about trying it</a>. Sadly, I can&#8217;t comment on Jonathan&#8217;s blog, which I partly understand and which partly just drives me nuts. Somehow I am growing accustomed to Blogs being a two way street and I love giving feedback to some things and be it just a simple note. There should be at least some kind of contact form on the site. But please if you read this, continue blogging Jonathan, even though you can&#8217;t enable comments at this time. And taste crocodile, it&#8217;s even better than kangaroo!</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: He does use Technorati or similar things to know who talks about him ;) Thanks Jonathan.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Very nice article in wired about changes in the distribution mechanisms that drive our economy around industries like books and cds. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html"> title=&quot;The Long Tail&quot;&gt;The Long Tail</a>and it shows that things might be changing even further than we would have thought, and that just because we suddenly can link between things, recommend based on patterns and from inventories that need not be physically there.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;With no shelf space to pay for and, in the case of purely digital services like iTunes, no manufacturing costs and hardly any distribution fees, a miss sold is just another sale, with the same margins as a hit. A hit and a miss are on equal economic footing, both just entries in a database called up on demand, both equally worthy of being carried. Suddenly, popularity no longer has a monopoly on profitability.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;A good example of this is Wal-Mart: &lt;em&gt;Wal-Mart must sell at least 100,000 copies of a CD to cover its retail overhead and make a sufficient profit; less than 1 percent of CDs do that kind of volume.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;What this means is that most CDs out there will never be sold, not because they won&#8217;t be bought, but because they don&#8217;t get shelf space. Sure, you might not be a big hit selling 5 CDs a year, but this is where the long tail comes in. The article goes on to make an example of Rhapsody, an online subscription-based streaming music service.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Not only is every one of Rhapsody&#8217;s top 100,000 tracks streamed at least once each month, the same is true for its top 200,000, top 300,000, and top 400,000. As fast as Rhapsody adds tracks to its library, those songs find an audience, even if it&#8217;s just a few people a month, somewhere in the country.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is the Long Tail.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The examples go on. Barnes&amp;Noble carries 130k books and more than 50% of Amazon&#8217;s sales do not come from these same books! I am starting to have the slight feeling that the tail might win ;)
&lt;/p&gt;</p>
