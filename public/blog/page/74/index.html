  <div class="entry-content"><p>The FeedBurner folks just <a href="http://www.burningdoor.com/feedburner/archives/001146.html">posted</a> that they will support Google&#8217;s current trials of adding AdSense Ads to your RSS Feeds directly via FeedBurner. It&#8217;s still in closed trials but will get out once Google has finished those at which time the support will be in FeedBurner. Kick Ass! Congrats people. Google is building a new market there, now like with <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/04/google_adsense_.html">their CPM Image Ads move</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;I am finally getting the time to comment a bit on the recent <a href="http://services.google.com/ads_inquiry/sitetarget?hl=en">announcement</a> of running site targetted image ads on a CPM basis through their network, which gets even more interesting in light of <a href="http://www.marketingvox.com/archives/2005/04/25/doubleclick_sale_goes_through/index.php?rss1">DoubleClick being sold</a>. Why interesting? DoubleClick started out being a network of sites and they stopped doing that in the downturn, only leasing their technology. Of course their model was different in that they only sold CPM based ads for then high prices. Google has their auction and performance system which makes Google AdSense a system that gives you access to the sales channel of lots of customers (who acquire users). That gives Google a wonderful leg up. They can fill up the rest of the ad space with their sales channel access. Google has a wonderful leg up here.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Now they are also adding Flash banners and some smaller publishers like JenSense are already <a href="http://www.jensense.com/archives/2005/04/adwords_ads_fla.html">not too happy</a> about that because they don&#8217;t really want flash banners on their site. What Google is doing is going <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001460.php">into the branding business</a>. As <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001460.php">John says</a> they are now competing with everyone out there. As I already commented on John&#8217;s post I see some problems with that.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The thing is that Google up till now allowed big web sites to get into a previously untabbed market that did not directly compete with their current offerings. These sites sold high priced CPM placements for branding purposes, requireing the high price because of the perceived value of their own brand and users. These prices might have been too high and they often were not sold out. But to not endanger their branding campaigns they would not allow low paid campaigns on their sites, which would be like selling below (their believed) value. Now Google is taking a direct assault on that market. That&#8217;s not good.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Of course Google might have the idea, possibly rightly so, that their system, which allows for the best price to be found for a performance advertisement, also can do that for a branding campaign. The problem is that it is not set up like this. In the current setup, as I understand it, the CPM based Image Ad will be run whenever it outbeats a mix of text ads that as a aggregate will earn a higher CPM. There is no way for the web site to say that an image ad should be for example 4 times the value of the text based ads for example. But they should be able to say that or something similar. Of course it is unlikely in my mind that the performance driven crowd that uses Ad Words will see so much added value in branding. They will measure the image ads the same way as they measure the other campaigns, which is total and utter nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The thing is that Google is overdoing it in their quest to make more money. They didn&#8217;t think this fully through it seems and they should have that capability as I hold them to the highest regard. They are now getting up against some of the major players out there. This will get even more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<time datetime="2005-04-24T09:43:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 24<span>th</span>, 2005</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finished reading The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni and it was a book I really enjoyed. The book is actually written as a story of a new CEO of a company with a dysfunctional team, and as such very nice to read. It&#8217;s also not too long and gets right down to the point, aided by the fact that it is (as its a story) filled with good examples. The theory is easy to understand and yet very powerful. I included the general concept right here.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.thylmann.net/images/5doat-1.jpg&quot; height=&quot;379&quot; width=&quot;537&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;4&quot; vspace=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;5Doat-1&quot; /&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Now the middle of the pyramid holds the general dysfunctions and they really build on each other. The right side hold more or less the problem that is often present at this stage. Often team members don&#8217;t want to be vulnerable and hence aren&#8217;t fully open about their mistakes. In absence of this, no real trust can be built up. Without trust you will not be able to go into real conflict which is needed though. An artificial harmony might be in the team where there is no real conflict, as conflict is not always harmonic but it needs to be there for the next stage to work. You will either have ambiguity in your decisions or real commitment, which will only be reached if the conflict has been handled well and thoroughly. Then you also commit to high standards and will be able to be accountable to those and challenged by your team mates. Then you can also achieve your results, provided you put the team first, yourself second.</p>

<p>All this is brought out in great detail in the book and yes, it sounds simple and it probably is, if you really confront this brutally. Of course, there are a million nuances and not everybody fits in there. But it&#8217;s a very good starting point to build a team.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sadly I can&#8217;t be in Paris on monday for <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/loicwiki/index.cgi?internet_2_0">Les blogs</a> but I managed to get several friends to go so I will hopefully get the inside story ;) If you, like me, want to but can&#8217;t go, here are two locations to get the latest info on all the fun.</p>

<p>-&gt; An RSS feed from Flickr is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=lesblogs&amp;amp;format=rss_200">here</a> from the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/lesblogs">lesblogs tag</a>.
-&gt; Technorati has the &lt;a rel=&quot;tag&quot; href=&quot;http://www.technorati.com/tag/lesblogs&quot;&gt;lesblogs&lt;/a&gt; tagged posts but sadly not RSS feed that I know of.</p>

<p>There is also an extensive list right <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/loicwiki/index.cgi?lesblogscoverage">here</a>.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Images are filling up on Flickr and it <a href="http://www.corante.com/getreal/archives/2005/04/25/les_blogs_paris_sort_of.php">seems</a> like doing this at the french senate hasn&#8217;t been the best idea ever &#8230; well I still think it is but I do not suffer from coffee withdrawl&#8230; only because I am not there &#8230; which is at least as sad as coffee withdrawl. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now how cool is that? Jeremy picked me as a possible lead for the Department of Commerce for a Blogger cabinet and that roughly the same time I put him on my Skype list (we got introduced to each other via our blogs some time ago). Check it out: &lt;a title=&quot;Ensight - Jeremy Wright ï¿½ Blogosphere Heads of State&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ensight.org/archives/2005/04/23/blogosphere-heads-of-state/&quot;&gt;Blogosphere Heads of State&lt;/a&gt;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, actually  the book is in german but the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1904879446">english transation</a> seems to be in production and boy can I suggest you read it. Tim Renner was already organizing gigs for bands when he was young and started working as a journalist which brought him to the idea to write an undercover-story about the music labels&#8230; which brought him to Polydor where he then worked, joyfully. He signed Element of Crime, got his first hit with Philip Boa, took over the lead of Progressive Music in 89 and then founded <a href="http://www.motor.de/">Motor Music</a> 5 years later as part of Polydor. Portishead and The Cardigans as well as 2Pac might be some of the very well known acts from that label. Rammstein would be another, who sold over 500k albums &#8230; in the US &#8230; in German! :)</p>

<p>After some steps he took over as CEO and Chairman of Universal Music Deutschland in 2001 (PolyGram joined forces with Universal in 1998). He there worked with Eminem, Sting, Pavarotti, U2, Bon Jovi and more. Then, when Universal needed to split with lots of national artists in Germany beginning 2004, he quit his position, took a trip around the world and wrote this book. (The german version of this can be found <a href="http://www.motor.de/timrenner/biographie">here</a>.)</p>

<p>He is now one of 100 managers being part of the Global Leaders of Tomorrow of the WEF. The book kicks ass. Why? Mainly because he is a great writer and knows the business inside out. It&#8217;s a wonderful mix. It also resonates with me a lot in terms of the problems with the stock market, short term thinking, bad consultants, and new world order due to the internet. The music industry was there due to the high amount of transaction costs in the process but this is slowly being removed and with it the need for the music industry (giants). There are also lots of great stories in the book so this might be for almost everyone. If you are interested in business and the music industry, linked with the times we live in, and want some great reading and writing, &#8230; if you are in germany, go out and buy the book. Otherwise, buy it in english when it is out!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Evan posted about <a href="http://www.evhead.com/2005/04/running-your-company-on-web-apps.asp">running your company on web apps</a> and I do agree with him. There is a lot of great stuff out there at the moment. <a href="http://www.jotspot.com/">JotSpot</a> is simply great and due to the internal applications and together with <a href="http://fogcreek.com/fogbugz">FogBugz</a>, I&#8217;d say that you have a wonderful system together there alone. FogBugz just kicks some major but, and Jot has so many useful applications that you&#8217;ll have basic applications settled, including recruiting, crm, contacts, tasks, &#8230; not to mention the Wiki itself. And if you want more powerful CRM systems, try out <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/home/">SugarCRM</a>, which is even free if you maintain it yourself and don&#8217;t need an Outlook connector and such.</p>

<p>Then you could, if you are not competing, use <a href="http://gmail.com/">GMail</a> for your basic eMail system and <a href="http://googlegroups.com/">Google Groups</a> for your mailing lists (stuff like press for example). Of course you track what is being said about you via <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati.com</a> or <a href="http://www.pubsub.com/">PubSub</a> and get your blog hosted on <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a> or even start a blog community for your users at <a href="http://www.21publish.com/">21Publish</a> (who are now allowing for free setups if you run their ads).</p>

<p>Then you still need phones, but for example <a href="http://www.netcologne.de/">Net Cologne</a> here in Germany offers a hosted PBX, where you just call to get more numbers. You could also just got with a good connection plus <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> and Mobile Phones. Hell, I have a US number now on Skype and Voicemail. I even bought a new Plantronics Headset to get good quality out of the damn thing.</p>

<p>Looking at the list one might start to wonder why found a company anyway, when all is practically taken care of. Give or take a few years, with PayPal and others making payment a charm, even cheaper airline tickets, better freelancer markets and a few more tricks, and we might handle a life without big companies &#8230; okok, might be hard to run McDo or BMW like this, but hey, it&#8217;s an idea for a small subset of the market. :)</p>

I really like the makeup of presenting the magazine online even though the design is nothing too special. Magazines will work hard at making themselves special through design and a design magazine with good design will not really stick out will it? :)</p>

<p>There seems to be one (in france?) that gets published in a different format each and every time. Like as a book once, and then as a set of post cards. Very nice indeed. You need to find something special for yourself, and it needs to be what the people want that you want to read your magazine of course.</p>
