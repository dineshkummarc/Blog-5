  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/000342.php">found out</a> that <a href="http://vivisimo.com/ebay">Vivisimo is searching eBay</a> via the eBay API none the less. I am starting to really like Vivisimo I have to say. I mean just search for <a href="http://test.vivisimo.com/search?query=Nokia+6600&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0&amp;amp;timeout=14000&amp;amp;form=simple-eBay&amp;amp;v%3Asources=eBay&amp;amp;v%3Aproject=eBay&amp;amp;sacategory=0">Nokia 6600</a> in all categories and you have that nice browsable list on the left side that lets you dig down deeper.  This fits wonderfully with <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/02/tim_bray_on_sea.html">Tim Bray&#8217;s articles on Search</a> which also mentioned that most people do not really use more than one word in their searches. You then need to give them the option to easily go deeper into the search results. I am starting to wonder if Vivisimo could become a threat for Google. We&#8217;ll see. If I were to look for a search engine for an intranet, I&#8217;d seriously consider Vivisimo as an option.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t know if I missed something but I just found <a href="http://www.google.com/services/free.html">Google Free Search</a> which allows you to customize the results page to your perferences with logo and colors and things like this. I actually have to admit that I hacked the Google Logo away as it does look weird on my background. We&#8217;ll see if that changes somehow. Would be good to have some kind of transparency on it that works.</p>

<p>But while I am at it, I do have a question for the Google Freaks out there. Is there an option to only get results back where the file types end in something, e.g. .html. The thing is as the search is now it finds any page on my site with a given word, including the monthly and category archives, instead of just giving me the entries. I know these end in index.html, but this is invisible and not in the target url as such. And Google actually makes a difference between /index.html and /. Any ideas? Am I making myself clear? :)</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: Thanks to <a href="http://charleswjones.com">Charles Jones</a> I looked at the filetype variable a little closer. I now added a hidden variable to the search box with the name as_filetype (not filetype on its own) and value &quot;html&quot;, which not only returns files in html but only returns results which end in .html, which is exactly what I wanted. The results should be a lot clearer now, not including category pages and the like.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To quote <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/05/sex.html">How Companies Have Sex</a> from FastCompany:
&lt;I&gt;
&quot;Sex is the key to the future of business.&quot;</p>

<p>-James Moore , Chairman, GeoPartners Research Inc.
&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>I thought, what??? But it turns out that it&#8217;s a great concept for thinking about how to get new things going. Read this:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;Perhaps the biggest lesson in corporate sex is to recognize the dangers of asexual reproduction and excessive inbreeding. No matter how successful a company&#8217;s current product or business model, clones and cousins are unlikely to result in new triumphs of the same magnitude. &lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>We all know that incest can be a really bad thing in terms of gene problems :) You need fresh stuff from the outside. You need new blood inside the company. The only problem I see here is that it really means that you need a Harem, a big pool of women or men, depending which sex you want to be yourself, or you yourself believe to be. Based on the article, the small company that looks for investment would be the woman, looking for a VC, the man, who previously just gave money, his semen, but now needs to give a lot more stuff like resources, connections and knowledge. Welcome to corporate emanzipation. ;)</p>

<p>Having a Harem comes with it&#8217;s own set of problems though. You need to make sure that you care for everybody equally well, that you can support them all and give everyone their time needed. If you want to bring a good child to this world you need a loving relationship to support it. You need to understand each others need and open communication.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;The second lesson is that organizational sex is not without its risks. One-night stands can lead to long-term regrets. In promiscuous pairings, bad things can get spread. There are organizational equivalents to sexually transmitted diseases, dangerous liaisons, even fatal attractions. At the same time, there is such a thing as organizational safe sex and committed relationships &#8211; combinations that pay attention to the long-term reasons for a particular pairing and manage closely the union of ideas, processes, and talent.&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>Thinking about all this in terms of sex, the question would be if you want to have sex with that other company and if you do, do you want it to be a one night stand or a committed relationship. What do you want from that relationship? Maybe every businessman should go out buying relationship books ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No, I am not at eTech, sadly. It seems to be the perfect place to be for somebody with technolust. But there are lots of summaries and notes to the speeches online, so here are some of them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Christian Lindholm from Nokia, as well as many others, posted about a proof-of-concept Series 60 Application that the Nokia CTO mentioned in his Keynote. It&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.christianlindholm.com/christianlindholm/2004/02/blogging_via_at.html">easy way to moblog from a series 60 phone</a> and was developed by <a href="http://www.futurice.fi/">Futurice</a>. The guy with the beard in the shot is probably famous by now as you see this picture everywhere. I really like the idea of not having to write an e-mail to post to my moblog but rather take a picture and then choose &quot;moblog&quot; from the menu. It&#8217;s likely not all that easy but it could be.</li>
<li>Matt Croydon posted about the <a href="http://postneo.com/2004/02/11.html#a3283">Anytime, Anywhere</a> keynote, talking about the future of wireless. Interaction between WLAN and 3G/GPRS will be big here. I rememeber that some months (or years even) back, Nokia even said in a presentation that the next 9210/9290 could have WiFi and 3G integrated taking whichever interface works best at any time. Read Matt&#8217;s post for a short introduction to all the current and future technologies but remember that it&#8217;s from a US perspective and UMTS/EDGE/W-CDMA are strangly absent even though they will likely be the biggest part of the networks of the future as it&#8217;s <em>the</em> upgrade path from GSM</li>
<li>Matt also posted <a href="http://postneo.com/2004/02/11.html#a3284">a summary</a> of Christian Lindholm&#8217;s speech. Great stuff about finding a trend and focus groups and building products that work.</li>
<li>On Loic&#8217;s blog you can check out <a href="http://www.u-blog.net/loic/note/57213">Justin sleeping</a>, <a href="http://www.u-blog.net/loic/note/57214">Howards cool shoes</a> and I have the slight feeling that <a href="http://www.u-blog.net/loic">Loic</a> is distributing Google Juice on a first names basis :)</li>
<li>Ross Mayfield posted the link to the <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/etech/pub?SessionNotes">O&#8217;Reilly Session Notes Wiki Page</a> which even holds some of the presentations!</li>
</ul>


<p>There you go. This should be well enough to read!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chris Pratley wrote a very good <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/chris_pratley/archive/2004/02/09/70474.aspx">post on Program Management</a> and what it really is. It really makes me want to do this even more, being the buffer between IT and Marketing/Sales. I took on the current position exactly because of this. I love both worlds but I am neither a sales guy nor a developer. I get along with both of them really well, love technology, love business (building a foundation via an MBA here) and hate it when the two sides clash for the little reason of miscommunication. This part is great:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;I&#8217;m not sure where this saying came from originally, but one way to describe PMs is that they not only &quot;pick up and run with the ball, they go find the ball&quot;. That really defines the difference between &quot;knowing what to do and doing it&quot;, and &quot;not knowing what to do, but using your own wits to decide what to do, then doing it&quot;. That means as a PM you are constantly strategizing and rethinking what is going on to find out if there is something you are missing, or the team is missing. Youâ€™re also constantly deciding what is important to do, and whether action needs to be taken. The number of such decisions is staggering.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Totally 100% agreed. And I also agree with Chris that one great thing about a holiday is not deciding what to do. Especially not something that might come back and haunt you :)</p>

<p>Thanks for the post <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/chris_pratley/">Chris</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Based on <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1024_3-5156992.html">this Cnet story</a>, Google is launching its ad service in China. This will likely include <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/">AdSense</a> and <a href="http://adwords.google.com/">AdWords</a> and with China being a big market, this is a very interesting move to watch. It&#8217;s be interesting to know how the interfaces work with the distinctly different character set and direction of texts.</p>
