  <div class="entry-content"><p>Had a good night out today. Yesterday was more something for sitting in front of the television watching stupid things and relaxing. Today we went to eat at a Brauhaus in Cologne. The place is run by students and they still make their own beer. Very nice one I would like to add and they only sell it there. I think it was called Hennes.</p>

<p>Their white beer tasts a little stale sometimes but otherwise is very good. Their strong bear was not there so I settled for Koelsch (attention the real letter here which is german and is what oe stands for, the o with the two dots above, does not work in livejournal :)) which is the beer you drink in Cologne (german name Koeln). It is really good there.</p>

<p>Anyway. Next to us was a very interesting table. something like 16 15 year old girls and one 35 year old guy. Interesting mix. Later 3 16 year old boys joined them though. There most interesting part for me was that they had a really cool phone. I sadly did not ask them which one it was but I will find out. I presume it was a japanese I-Mode phone. Something like the motorola star tac but a bit bigger and with color screen. Those things are really cool. Buy is japan more advanced then we are :)</p>

<p>We also had some very nice talks at our table. One of the couples is getting married soon and it is fun seeing them talk about what they still need to do. There are so many things to pay attention to really. Sadly I am too late to get the bride to wear a really sexy wedding dress. I gave some suggestions at an earlier meeting but I might be a bit over the top there. It would be really nice but maybe a bit too sexy. She agreed though that it might really look nice and will keep me in the loop for her choice.</p>

<p>It is weird. There are many people among my friends at the moment that seem to get married now or have just married. Something that I might really have to look into ;)</p>

<p>I still have to take a look for some jobs for people that work in hotels. Boy do they have a bad salary. It is amazing. There just seem to be too many people there that can do the job. Cooks earn quiet well though, especially if you are good. The point is probably that you can make yourself a name if you are good and then the hotel needs you kind of. They just cannot let you leave. That puts you in a very good position. So if you want to go into that direction, become a cook.</p>

<p>And if you are in Cologne, go to the Hennes :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well our flat-rate should be up again on Monday. It seems that with some support groups one hand doesn&#8217;t know what the other does or can do. Here a little tail.</p>

<p>Our flat-rate did not work. We called T-Online. It was a load problem. Oh ok. No problem.</p>

<p>Just to be save I asked again on who the account is registered. Well go figure. It was still on the wrong person, because I changed it to the company name 3 weeks earlier. We still do not get the right invoice.</p>

<p>Ok. I told them we need to change it again. Well. It now seemed that you cannot change it to a belgium address. Interesting to know as it worked (or did not :)) last time. Ok, I was given another number.</p>

<p>I called there. They said it already was the new address. Hmmm&#8230; the others just told me it isn&#8217;t. Well, another 2 days and it should be pushed through the system. Interesting system.</p>

<p>I called back the technical people 2 days later and well, the new address was no in there. No problem. Can you check the problem again? Yes. Ok. Well it is a load problem. I told them that it cannot be a load problem because it has been going on for 7 days now. Oh ok. Well it can also be that your account is locked. WHAT? And they tell me now? Well, seems like the last person did not know that the error code can have two meanings. Hmmm&#8230;</p>

<p>Called the billing people to find out why the account was locked. Well it was because we did not pay. WE DID NOT GET THE INVOICE!!! Ah well. Now it seemed that they still did not have the right address and they told me you cannot have a belgium address. Interesting once again. I was given the address of the main billing people. They were closed. at 1800!!! Ah well. I called back yesterday. And you wouldn&#8217;t believe it. They had the right address there now. WOW! And I gave them a bank account after I got the name of the person I spoke to there and they said the account will be active again on Monday. Ok, their system is slow, no problem. Monday is fine. And they promised me that the invoice would be there in 3 weeks. It&#8217;s a long way from Germany to Belgium :)</p>

<p>That&#8217;s another nice thing. If you send a snail mail from Brussels to Aachen (1:30 hours by car max) then it is flow to Duesseldorf from Brussels and then driven to Aachen (1:30 hours by car also :)). How efficient :)</p>

<p>But it is still very funny to witness all of this. By the way. If you want to lease a server with Dell, you need to lease it in the country your company is in. Good. No problem. But we need the server at Level 3 in New York. Ah well. We need to ship it then. Shiping a leased $12000 server is fun. Ah well. Let&#8217;s see what IBM says when they call me back next week :)</p>

<p>Live is so fun. This will be a good weekend. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think it&#8217;s time to make a reunion from my school days. I have just been contacted by an old friend from school whom I knew to be in spain but just now I learned that he has started a company which organises Golf Trips to their region. They have 3 houses, as it looks like, which are directly on the side of some golf courses there. It is so interesting to learn what friends you have no spoken to in several years are up to all of the sudden.</p>

<p>On a side note, doesn&#8217;t the internet make for an amazing holiday planning system? I mean I am starting to know people where I could sleep almost all over the world and the network is growing. Ahhh&#8230;</p>

<p>Good day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on YNOT) Some of you might have read my general statistics article from the February 22, 2001 edition of YNOT News.</p>

<p>This time I&#8217;ll go deeper into the general use of referrers, the feature telling you where your visitors come from. Referrers are one of the most valuable resource in any stats package, most easily exploited, and at the same time, underused.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>I will leave out domain referrers, which may tell you, for example, that you are getting a lot of hits from some free host, where you are in the webmaster help section, and from there where you are listed on the webmaster pages. I will also leave out search engine listings, which are just referrers which tell you on which SEs you are listed and possibly on which pages within any given search. I will leave out splitting up referrers to e-mails, news, files and more. These are all more or less obvious. I will just focus on the real, full URL referrers, telling you the exact location your visitors are coming from.</p>

<p>To grasp the entire concept you must look beyond your organization and more on your marketing and customers. What do my customers want? Where do they find what they are looking for? What do my partners want from me? How can I help them? The list could go on and on but the general question that
should follow is, can your referrers help you? You probably have a lot of links to your Website on other sites and the list might be growing. Actually let
me rephrase that. The list should be growing, keeping old links while adding new. First of all, check your referrers to see where most of your visitors come from. Take a look at those sites to see where you are listed and find out what they do. Both in terms of how they seem to be attracting visitors and how they are making money. From this information alone, you are in a good position to:</p>

<p>Contact the webmaster/company to thank them and possibly talk about working together more closely. Maybe you can talk them into putting your link at a better position in return for better commissions or in return for something else valuable for them.</p>

<p>Learn more about what your visitors are interested in. What kind of sites do they visit? What kind of links do they click? Send those people graphics or text link suggestions to see if those pull better. You will probably learn over time which visitors convert best for you. The webmaster you are contacting will probably not mind &#8211; if it results in happier visitors or more money for him. Keep them up to date on what is happening on your site, especially what is happening that is of vital interest to them.</p>

<p>Next, monitor your stats for referrers from new sites. As soon as they turn up, send those people a thank you note. They will be positively surprised that you noticed so fast. We are living in Web times but you can still surprise a lot of people by being very responsive and nimble.</p>

<p>The above point is especially good for your PR department (even if you don&#8217;t have a PR department, you should be sending out press releases). Whenever you send out a press release, it is bound to appear somewhere. Ok, not entirely true. You want it to appear everywhere. You hope it will appear somewhere and if it appears anywhere, then you should know and value that page highly. By monitoring your referrer list you can easily screen out those sites that print your press releases and put them on a special distribution list for the future. They already wrote about you once, they are likely to do it again.</p>

<p>Remember though, news items can appear anytime, meaning the PR people need to be in the loop for the appearance of new referrers.</p>

<p>Referrers also help in partnerships. Everyone can say: &quot;We have 100,000 hits a day and we will place your button on all the pages if you do &#8230;&quot;. Via your referrer logs, you can see how many hits your partner is really sending you. This can be good in negotiating a good deal for both sides. (With exit stats you could see how many hits you are sending your partners).</p>

<p>A last item would be that I have just added a new feature to my company that will tell you not only how many visitors came to your site from a given URL, but also how many of those are new. This is done through so-called persistent cookies, which tell us that the visitor has already been to your site before. For example:</p>

<p>Site A sends you 100 visitors each day. Very cool &#8211; you think.
Site B sends you 50 each day. Not bad, either.</p>

<p>But &#8230;
Site A sends you only 20 new visitors per day. This might be because a lot of people might be using the site as their starting point.
Site B sends you 40 new visitors each day. Possibly because they are getting a lot of hits from Search Engines.</p>

<p>Do you see the value? I hope so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well my bank recently send me a mail saying that my brokerage service, Brokerage 24 from the Deutsche Bank 24 (somebody smoked something again there when they just started putting 24 at the end of everything), would be renamed to MaxBlue. Wow. What a name. It would actually be the same thing with added features. Cool enough. I already suspect that they are merging Brokerage 24 with their failed venture moneyshelf.de. Anyway.</p>

<p>So what do we have.  I went to http://www.maxblue.de and this is a totally stupid looking web site. Like coming soon with a standard counter on it. I already wanted to scream that they do not have the domain to the name when I looked it up at geektools.com and hey, it belongs to them. I am <em>really</em> not sure if that is better though.</p>

<p>MaxBlue.com was registered by the Deutsche Bank in London.</p>

<p>Well ok. I have to admit. It is better then anderesen consulting who renamed themselve accenture and did not even have all the domains while saying that they checked if they were free in their press release. YOU NEED TO REGISTER THEM NOT CHECK!!!</p>

<p>God.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That actually says it all. The bigger they get, the more pain they are. This counts for the company currently responsible for my internet connection which says that they have load problems &#8230; ok &#8230; BUT SINCE THURSDAY?!?!? They are also sending the bills to the wrong people, which is just as stupid.</p>

<p>Then there is a hosting company which is being an enormous pain to cancel an account with them and get the domain moved away from them. Of course reaching them to sign up is no problem but you have this very special non-free number where you hang in line for 30 minutes before somebody tells you that the person responsible for that is not there. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</p>

<p>I need to de-register a company in the US which has been an ongoing effort for some time and you would have thought that if you tell the people: &quot;Send me everything I need and bill everything to this Visa card&quot; that things would not take over a month. Well nothing yet. Another phone call.</p>

<p>Well back to business. Grr&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi Everyone,</p>

<p>I am back under the living with the bed full of candy. We just had Karneval in Aachen, which is somewhat similar to Karneval in Rio just a bit more foolish and less naked. The parade started at 1300 which was when we started drinking beer, screaming, shouting, having loads of fun. OCHER ALAAF is what you are shouting here in Aachen by the way. Ocher would be people from Aachen in the local dialect. Alaaf is just &#8230; emm&#8230; what you scream on Karneval. :)</p>

<p>The city was full full full with hundreds of people in front of our appartment on the main market (did I already tell you I live on the main square of Aachen?). The parade took about 3 hours. There is still a lot of screaming and musik outside of my window and it will probably continue throughout the night. I presonally slept for 2 hours after 2 liters of beer which is something that my body is not used to between 13:00 and 17:00 :) I would probably be at 4 liters now if we had not decided to stop the party for a bit and possible pick up at night again. I probably shouldn&#8217;t have allowed my body to relax :)</p>

<p>As another note I am working on my own style for my journal which is really an interesting thing to do. And I like some of the basics from which I started so much that I will probably use it for my own pages which I am just starting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a new image up which is actually a clipping from my picture on <a href="http://inside.benews.com">inside.benews.com</a> and rather old. But <a href="http://shacker.livejournal.com">Scot</a> convinced me that it would be a good idea if you <em>can</em> see my face in the picture.</p>

<p>I need a new digital camera by the way. These things are addictive. A friend of mine has a Casio (yes they do not only make watches :)) which lets you use an IBM Microdrive. That rules. And they have a new one which is about the size of the Canon Ixus and also has place for the Microdrive. 1 Gig of high resolution images to carry around :) Wow! :) Drool.</p>

<p>I would like to thank the amazing <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/ziemkowski">Dr Z</a> (sorry, that nick is too cool and fitting :)) for welcoming me to the collective in his latest post.</p>

<p>And everybody bow before the might <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/grahams/">Sean</a> who is now no longer studying :)</p>

<p>And while we are at it and are spreading knowledge, I suggest you all head on over to Cal Evans site and read his <a href="http://www.calevans.com/articles/nerdHerding.html">Nerd Herding</a> which is a very fun and insightful thing to read. At least from my perspective.</p>

<p>I have some others on my palm that I might share with you at a later date.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>God that feels good. I just finished my first Tutor Marked Assignement (TMA) for my current MBA studies. Just to tell everybody a bit more about me, I am doing part time studies for an MBA at the Open University in England, which is a university that is targetted at people that are working and lets you work from home/work. Up till not, I started this month, it is a lot of fun and very insightful.</p>

<p>I mean I am running/started two companies and have some many ideas at 25 that I just know I need some basic theory to really be good at what I do. LOL :)</p>

<p>Well it is a wonderful day. If only I would not have so many things to do then I would be working on my personal home page again. Damn.</p>

<p>Ah well. The time will come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I made it to bed at 4:30 am yesterday, somewhat later then I planned but I am back up and happy to tell the world that I still think the idea of doing a journal is good :)</p>

<p>Now shortly to the BizKiffer nickname. That actually is one of the first nicknames that really fits I think. It came directly from friends after they noticed me reading so many business books and magazines. So Biz stands for Business. Smoking hemp/pott.. is called Kiffen in germany, so a Kiffer is somebody who does that. Together with Biz it should just show that I really enjoy reading business books and people see that when I am :)</p>

<p>There you have it.</p>

<p>Other than that I have a very good morning and actually was not waken by the loud noise of people singing. I am living on the main square in Aachen/Germany and we have Karneval now, which is the time of year where people are &quot;allowed&quot; to go crazy. Think of it as Halloween without the scary part and with A LOT of alcohol. Because I live on the main square, all big happenings take place directly in front of my window. Thursday that was bad when at 8:30am you had people testing a PA system for the first meeting of the Aachener Karnevals Verein. And tomorrow, monday, it will be bad, mainly because we have a big parade through Aachen and it will go past my window. It will also be a lot of fun as you might have realized by now. The entire square will be drunk by mid day :)</p>

<p>Anyway. I have a lot to do today in terms of writing some articles and get the basics for a contract done. Have a good day.</p>
