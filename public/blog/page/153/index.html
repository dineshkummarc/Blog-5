  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was simply looking at my TypePad Stats (based on browsing behaviour I&#8217;d say the Googlebot has arrived after I redirected my old site), when I found <a href="http://caffeineslinger.typepad.com/">Caffeineslinger</a>, another TypePad blog. What caught my attention was his <a href="http://caffeineslinger.typepad.com/les/2003/12/more_creepy_stu.html">&lt;i&gt;More Creepy Stuff from Japan&lt;/i&gt;</a> post about somebody who, obviously due to a sexual latex fetish judging by some of the pics, is painting girls one colour and then even pours that colour over them.
&lt;br /&gt;<a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/yellow.jpg">&lt;img alt=&quot;yellow.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/yellow-thumb.jpg&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;</a>
&lt;br /&gt;
While it is not something I can personally get sexually excited about, it is an interesting picture. The others are a bit more creepy, but the yellow one is nice. There is a <a href="http://village.infoweb.ne.jp/~fwiz4610/manon/miv08.htm">black</a> and <a href="http://village.infoweb.ne.jp/~fwiz4610/manon/miv04.htm">colourful</a> image series available.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are into games and you are a developer and you think wireless has a wonderful future, Nokia&#8217;s paper on <a href="http://ncsp.forum.nokia.com/downloads/nokia/documents/Multi_play_Mobi_v_1_0_en.pdf">Multiplayer Mobile Game Design</a> is a very good read to get introduced to the subject.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>I am still trying to think about a mobile game myself. There are some things that would drive a successful game I think. First of all involvement and interactivity over a longer term. You need to get SMS messages or something else to tell you that you need to do something new, but you need to be able to choose when to react within a given timeframe, let&#8217;s say 1-5 hours. When I am on the train to work I want to be able to choose my next moves but then I am at work and don&#8217;t want to do something for a few hours, on the game that is ;).</p>

<p>I also think that graphics aren&#8217;t of the utmost importance when you think about the game on a mobile phone. Sure, they have to look good, but the time for full 3D power isn&#8217;t there yet. The N-Gage from Nokia is doing something great there but as Nokia has said themselves, it will take some time for something like this to really take off. As always, Nokia is in this for the long run and they are learning far earlier than anyone else thanks to the N-Gage.</p>

<p>Chess would be a good idea for a mobile server based game. Especially with MMS you could send arround the boards. Then add a little bit more interactivity to it, a little bit more liveliness ala Tamagotchi, then we are getting somewhere. If you have any ideas, I&#8217;d like to hear about them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, I made the move, even though <a href="http://www.lumma.de/">Nico</a> from <a href="http://www.blogg.de/">Blogg.de</a> suggested using Blogg.de as my blogging engine. Sorry Nico. I just feel somehow connected to the Six Log people for now. I have already sent people from Germany to Blogg.de though, so not all is lost ;)
 everything ;)</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>But anyway. For the sake of simplicity and to not have to worry about updates and everything, I opted to move all my stuff from MovableType to TypePad, with my Homepage currently building up at <a href="http://oliver.thylmann.com/">oliver.thylmann.com</a>. I am already feeling happy with TypePad even though I will likely have to make some suggestions in the next few weeks for improvements. At the moment you can only do moblogging to one blog or photo album for example. It works via a secret eMail I can send stuff to and it would be easy (I believe) to allow me to have 3 of those eMails.</p>

<p>Looking forward to posting some more now. Let&#8217;s see how this goes. First thing I have to do is wait for Google to index this site so I can have it searchable again. This is something truely missing from TypePad, a good search integrated into your blog. A well. Can&#8217;t have everything :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning Nokia stock was at something like 14 EURs and I had a <a href="http://www.clickoptions.com/">ClickOptions</a> bet going on that it would reach 15.30 EURs by tomorrow. I actually bought that when Nokia still was at arround 15 EURs beginning/mid last month. What happens now? Nokia raises their forecast for the forth quarter and the stock jumps 14% to almost 16 EURs. I invested 40 EURs, thought I lost them and now I am getting 100 EURs. Now that&#8217;s fun :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316346624/bizkiffer-20">The Tipping Point</a> by Malcom Gladwell and it is truely a very good book, something already hinted at by the huge amount of quotes from other reviewers at the beginning of the book. The book is worth it for the examples of the theory presented alone, which are sometimes interesting and sometimes downright scary. It talks about how epidemics take off, how things suddenly become &quot;in&quot; again and sell amazingly well&#8230; and how they loose it.</p>

<p>As a rough run-down, he argues that there is first of all something he calls &quot;The Law of the Few&quot;, being about special people that have a big impact on things. These are connectors (people that tend to know a lot more people than average), mavens (people that tend to know everything, that try things out first) and salesmen (who have a way with people, making a sale). You need all three kind of people for the epidemic, or your product, to take off. Lots of examples are, as always, in the book.</p>

<p>Then you have &quot;The Stickiness Factor&quot;, which is about the fact that whatever you are looking at, it has to stick, it has to be remembered. Also important is &quot;The Power of Context&quot;, meaning that you can&#8217;t look at things in isolation, but rather only within their environment. Here he talks about how getting rid of graffiti on trains helped to reduce violence in New York, which deep down really means that people are not evil by nature but that a surrounding that tells them anything goes, that sets bad examples, influences people to feel ok to act a certain way. This is very simplified but again, great detail in the book.</p>

<p>Then there is, again as part of context, the magic number 150, being the amount of people who are likely closely linked with. The group is rarely bigger and things really start to fall appart when it is. This is one of the reasons why <a href="http://www.gore.com/">Gore Associates</a>, the people behind GoreTex and other things, break up teams of more than 150 into smaller groups, even if it means setting up a second fab!</p>

<p>Then follow several case studies on things like Smoking and Airwalk shoes. Really check it out. It&#8217;s thought provoking to say the least.</p>
