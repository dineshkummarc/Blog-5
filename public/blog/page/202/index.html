  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here I am, off from work, sitting in an internet cafe, surfing. I have to admit though, that I have an excuse. I just met an old friend again who is shortly going online with his laptop and I just needed to try out the powermacs with this HUGE LCD screen they have here. It&#8217;s wonderful, even though at the moment I have like 60% of my screen space lost because the browser is scaled to full screen. But it&#8217;s an amazing screen I have to admit. And the Powermac is not really <em>that</em> noisy. Still. This again shows me how wonderful the Mac is to work on and I am truely thinking about an iMac. It would be close to silent and with the cool 17&quot; screen it would rock. the only problem I have now is that I need to decide what kind of route I am taking. I am thinking about a DVD Recorder to replace the old Video Recorder, but if I do, it should be compatible with the desktop PC really. There are still competing standards out there though. Tough questions to think about on a Wednesday evening in Cologne. It was a great day though up till now.</p>

<p>What is all this about you might ask. Well. All of the company&#8217;s profits, over $125 Million by now, are going to charities!!! And the company seems to be growing like crazy. <a href="http://www.newmansown.com/">Check it out!</a></p>

<p>I loved Dee Hock&#8217;s book &quot;Birth of the Chaordic Age&quot;. In it, Dee Hock lays out a possible new way to build/run/maintain organisations. I can only suggest reading it.</p>

<p>As for emergent democracy, I still have to fully twist my head arround it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google has for some time now run Ads on their search results in terms of so called AdWords (check <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/">here</a>. This is ok, and interesting and all that and it seems to be making them good money. On top of that, it might allow googles to share revenue with bloggers, giving them the option to put AdWords on their blogs.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>The interesting part came to me now. Google is running ads! Yes! But! What they are doing is running ads on other sites which display a set number of AdWords from a category that fits to the site that they ad is on. You go to a jewlery shop, which also runs ads, and suddenly there is an ad with 4 text links to other jewlery shops. Great great targetting to say the least, especially because through their search engine, Google more or less knows what kind of site they currently need to send an ad to.</p>

<p>This has happened on <a href="http://www.counted.com/">counted.com</a> for example. This is the counter I co-built, and it&#8217;s running ads from <a href="http://www.tribalfusion.com/">TribalFusion</a>.</p>

<p>There are several things I need to ask myself now though. For one, do I want to kill any ads from Google? They are pointing people to the direct competition. Normally this wouldn&#8217;t happen, because normally you would screen your ads, but we don&#8217;t. We let TribalFusion handle it all, which makes for less work obviously.</p>

<p>The second question is money. Google, obviously pays money to run those ads. TribalFusion is a CPM network, meaning that Google pays per 1000 ads being displayed. AdWords is a CPC system, meaning that Google gets money per click on a link. This would only be good for Google, if they got more money out of it than they put into it. If they do however, it makes you wonder if CPM is getting too cheap. CPM ads are not about clicks really, they include a branding part in the equation. This branding part needs to be taken into account. CPC shouldn&#8217;t have any branding associated to it, which is true for AdWords, but hence it should be cheaper when calculating it in terms of displays of the ad in relation to a CPM deal.</p>

<p>All in all, it gets confusing but mighty interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I actually didn&#8217;t know if I should have put this under the business category. But Rockstar Games have updated their &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; popular game Grand Theft Auto. It&#8217;s one, if not the, best seller on the PS2 and other consoles and they now have Grand Theft Auto Vice City as an update. What they seem to be doing is simply taking the &quot;old&quot; game and making it a teaser for the big one. Congratulations!</p>

I registered to be notified when it&#8217;s out. It looks beautiful, which is important. This might be a P2P system that goes the next step.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Doc Searls and David Weinberger have just published &lt;a title=&quot;World of Ends&quot; href=&quot;http://www.worldofends.com/&quot;&gt;World of Ends&lt;/a&gt;. To quote Doc: &quot;&lt;I&gt;The idea is to help save dumb companies (and whole industries) from wasting their money and our time by failing to grok what the Net is fundamentally about.&lt;/i&gt;. And from the article: &lt;I&gt;We can end the tragedy of Repetitive Mistake Syndrome in our lifetimes — and save a few trillion dollars’ worth of dumb decisions — if we can just remember one simple fact: the Net is a world of ends. You&#8217;re at one end, and everybody and everything else are at the other ends.&lt;/I&gt; Lots of people will argue that this is overly simplistic and hence, cannot be proved to be wrong. Sometimes it boils down to simple things though.</p>

<p>Some comments follow.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Ok, I will try to give some feedback here. The discussion might be interesting and it&#8217;s likely very important for wireless.</p>

<p>First of all, a lot of people might mistake this Internet for the WWW. This is not what this article is about. Still, I think, due to the way it is branded in the media, we might make that mistake, so let&#8217;s rule that out from the start.</p>

<p>Point 1 and 2, I am in full agreement. Then it starts to get a little scetchy. The internet is not stupid for one (point 3). It might be stupider than other things, but we know where packets are coming from. The telephone network doesn&#8217;t know either that I am Oliver, it&#8217;s just that the other end of the line might know that my number is Oliver. Same for the internet. If I had a fixed IP address, everybody could know that I am Oliver. The other side of the arguement might go that this is something that is added on top of the internet, so ok, might have to give in to that.</p>

<p>Point 4 is something I don&#8217;t really agree to. VoIP is a good idea, but these packets are more important due to their nature. If we agreed to the above statement, that things like Caller ID are something that it added on top of the network, then this too, is added on top. The value is only lowered if something else really will have a lower value. In case we use the current bandwidth, and suddenly say that 90% of it will be VoIP, then the rest will slow down and it will have lower value. But it&#8217;s added services that have lower value there, the system of sending packets arround is still the same. If we create additional bandwidth, the equation is different. It&#8217;s a system about 1+1=2 or 1+1 = 1 and &quot;the Internet&quot; doesn&#8217;t stick at 1. It&#8217;s growing. One might say that by now the Internet is a number of 13673903398. As long as we do not add value on top of routing packets arround, we have no value. Routing packets arround is an enabler for value.</p>

<p>The internet is no free market for innovation. Emm&#8230; no, in general it is, provided we thing bandwidth is free, but it isn&#8217;t. The internet is something new, hence a new field for new innovation.</p>

<p>I like the idea of point 6, and it&#8217;s essentially a good way to go.</p>

<p>The other points are good and I like point 10. What if I could put all my MP3s online and have you buy them from me, getting 10% of the revenue?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this story (&lt;a title=&quot;Google&#8217;s Memory Upgrade - How Blogger could do more than improve Google&#8217;s Web searches. By Steven Johnson&quot; href=&quot;http://slate.msn.com/id/2079747&quot;&gt;Google&#8217;s Memory Upgrade - How Blogger could do more than improve Google&#8217;s Web searches. By Steven Johnson&lt;/a&gt;) Steve Johnson argues that there might be something else which made Google buy Blogger. The idea is good. Get a Google/Blogger account and when you find interesting stuff, simply blog about it, which is likely better than bookmarking. This is something I use a lot in MovebleType now. By a simple right click in IE I can post a story about the current site I visit. This makes it very simple to remember the stuff you found interesting and in the end you can easily search you blog. Great stuff and an interesting concept.</p>
