  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ginger, now known as <a href="http://www.segway.com/">Segway Human Transporter</a> is all the hype at the moment, at least with many of the technology adicted friends I have. Now business 2.0 has an article that might put everything in perspective. The thing is that the current model just keeps up for 11miles and then runs out of power. For a really commercial hit, and a $100 million investment by partners, that just doesn&#8217;t make sense. The rumors are starting to be coming up that the company is working on a Stirling Engine. This would give them a highly efficient energie source, virtually silent and exhaust-free. They could sell that to anything that needs a small and capable motor.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just found this one. Some examples of why the human race has probably evolved as far as possible. Actual label instructions on consumer goods.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;
On Sears hairdryer:
Do not use while sleeping.
(Gee, that&#8217;s the only time I have to work on my hair!)</p>

<p>On a bag of Fritos:
You could be a winner! No purchase nesessary.
Details inside.
(The shoplifter special!)</p>

<p>On a bar of Dove soap:
Directions: Use like regular soap.
(and that would be how?)</p>

<p>On some Swann frozen dinners:
Serving suggestion: Defrost.
(But it&#8217;s <em>just</em> a suggestion!)</p>

<p>On a hotel provided shower cap in a box:
Fits one head.
(The big one or the little one?)</p>

<p>On Tesco&#8217;s Tiramisu dessert: (printed on box bottom):
Do not turn upside down.
(Too late! You lose!)</p>

<p>On Marks &amp; Spencer Bread Pudding:
Product will be hot after heating.
(Are you sure??? Let&#8217;s experiment.)</p>

<p>On packaging for a Rowenta iron:
Do not iron clothes on body.
(But wouldn&#8217;t that save more time?)
(And whose body?)</p>

<p>On Boot&#8217;s Children&#8217;s cough medicine:
Do not drive car or operate machinery.
(We could do a lot to reduce the rate of construction if we just kept those 5 year olds off those fork lifts.)</p>

<p>On Nytol sleep aid:
Warning: may cause drowsiness.
(One would hope!)</p>

<p>On a Korean kitchen knife:
Warning keep out of children.
(Or pets! What&#8217;s for dinner?)</p>

<p>On a string of Chinese-made Christmas lights:
For indoor or outdoor use only.
(As opposed to use in outer space.)</p>

<p>On a Japanese food processor:
Not to be used for the other use.
(Hmm, now I&#8217;m curious.)</p>

<p>On Sainsbury&#8217;s peanuts:
Warning: contains nuts.
(but no peas?)</p>

<p>On an American Airlines packet of nuts:
Instructions: open packet, eat nuts.
(have lobotomy)</p>

<p>On a Swedish chainsaw:
Do not attempt to stop chain with your hands or genitals.
(What is this, a home castration kit?)</p>

<p>On a child&#8217;s Superman costume:
Wearing of this garment does not enable you to fly.
(That&#8217;s right, destroy a universal childhood fantasy!)
&lt;/i&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Interesting little article by Kasparov about his game against Deep Blue, by IBM, and now Deep Junior. It&#8217;s especially interesting to note that he sees a very scientifc challenge and mind game in the way it is working now, while Deep Blue was nothing more than a PR stunt. He explains why. &lt;a title=&quot;OpinionJournal - Extra&quot; href=&quot;http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110003081&quot;&gt;OpinionJournal - Extra&lt;/a&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There you have it, I did something that might be called illegal. Today, I went to see <a href="http://www.72qmddr.de">a movie</a>. The film was ok, nothing more, nothing less. Partly due to the fact that I thought it was a comedy and it wasn&#8217;t (bad commercials I&#8217;d say, or good ones depending on your view point ;)). After the movie, I got into the car and wanted to get out of the parking lot. Easier said than done because there were huge lines of cars. I would say that there were at least 40 to 60 cars standing arround virtually doing nothing, in line, waiting to get out. Something was wrong with the barrier. Strangely enough, nobody was coming down though to get it to open and everybody who by now would be arriving at the upper barrier, which was the only one open and probably far over 20 cars away for almost everyone in sight, would have a ticket that no longer works as you need to get out within 20 minutes if I am not mistaken. I waited for sometihng to happen for like 5 minutes in which I started to wonder if it is really the best thing to have that many motors running in a closed space. Anyway &#8230;</p>

<p>I then got out of the car and soon we were something like 6 to 8 people (the rest seemingly wanted to wait forever) at the barriers wondering what to do. I started talking with somebody about how the barriers work and then we got an idea. A car, from outside, arrived, we gieded him to the entry barrier, he got a ticket, the barrier opened, he drove away, and we took turns holding up the barrier. The cars, who all had paid their tickets started getting out. Several people took turns holding open the barrier and when I arrived something like a minute or two later with my car, it was down. Do not dispair though, somebody else had taken the tough decision and simply broken open the exit barrier, which was now standing wide open.</p>

<p>All in all, I am not even sure if what we did was illegal. I mean, we all (well at least most by far) paid their ticket. I for one, didn&#8217;t destroy anything. It&#8217;s even likely that the exit barrier that was standing up now isn&#8217;t broken either. It was an interesting experience though. How long would people have waited. What would they have done. Why would they have done nothing? Would it have become a problem with the air? How long would it have taken? Interesting to say the least. Bed time now. The day ended with a smile. :)</p>
