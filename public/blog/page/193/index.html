  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Operations should provide a competitive advantage. You need to keep in mind the strategy hierarchy:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Corporate Strategy (What business should we be in?)
-&gt;
Business Strategy (How should we compete?)
-&gt;
Functional Strategy (How should we support this?)</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>The four stage model provides a framework for how operations contribute to competitiveness&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Stage 1: Internally neutral; Objective is to minimize the negative impact of operations; does not provide any contribution; either do not realize or do not appreciate
Stage 2: Externally neutral; Objective is for operations to help the business maintain parity with its competitors; performs as well, still does not provide competitive advantage; are aware but did not start to improve
Stage 3: internally supportive; Objective is for operations to provide credible support for business strategy; provides a competitive edge, as good as other operations in its sector but is not yet being exploited
Stage 4: externally supportive; Objective is for operations to provide a source for competitive advantage; source of persistent competitive advantage; operations function are world-class&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are several aspects to operational performance and they are interlinked and each contributes to each other:
- Do things right the first time (Quality)
- Do things quickly (Speed)
- Do things on time (Dependability)
- Do different things or do things differently (Flexibility)
- Do things with fewer resources (Cost)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;They have both an internal and an external meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;For an example see Book 4, page 13: Hospital, Car factory, Bus Company, Supermarket&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;One of the most important measures is how resources (transforming and transformed) are used. The four Es (Economy, Efficiency, Effectiveness, Ethics) are important here.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Earlier companies looked mainly at financial performance but the changing business no longer has much value to operations management. This was done mainly because overheads were minimal but
- More automation meant these measurements would become problematic
- Management focused not on entire organization but on parts
- It looked at past rather than future and now you need to focus on continued improvement
- It neglected customer satisfaction and quality&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Cost is only one of five sources for competitive advantage. In the 1980s performance measurements systems were introduced to provide clear and common-sense measurements that reflect trends and long-term improvements, support decision-making and direct and motivate workers. Two of these methods are activity-based costing (ABC) and the balanced scorecard.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The essence of an effective performance management system is measuring the right things and the measures must be balanced, dynamic, timely, efficient, measure key processes and focus on customer satisfaction. You need to create a closed loop so that performance measures result in corrective action.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Set performance objectives -&gt; Develop performance criteria -&gt; Take action and measure results -&gt; Assess results and decide what to do&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emphasis multiple perspectives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emphasis the whole system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emphasis the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Lean production came from Toyota and focused on removing waste in automobile assembly.
- Waste from producing defects
- Waste in transportation
- Waste in inventory
- Waste from over-production
- Waste of waiting time
- Waste in processing
- Waste of motion&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The quality gaps model by Parasuraman is another method (See Certificate).&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The 5-S model focused on a clean and tidy workplace as a good indicator of high performance.
- Proper arrangement and organization
- Orderliness
- Clean-up
- Cleanliness
- Discipline&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Page 19 of Book 4 provides a nice guideline on assessing a company based on these methods.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Operations = All the steps of the transformation of raw materials to the product the client buys.
Operations Management = design, manage and improve the operations system.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>The historic development&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Craft Manufacturing: skilled craftspeople product goods in low volume; meet customers needs; works well for small-scale production with low levels of competition&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Mass Production: producing goods in high volume with low variety; customers expected to buy what is supplied; keeping costs/prices down; minimize variety; aggressive advertising and sales force; The &#8216;American system of manufacture&#8217; introduced standard parts to the assembly lines; &#8216;scientific management&#8217; by Frederick Taylor introduced the one best way of doing a job, a frequency of tasks; moving assembly line was introduced by Henry Ford&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The modern period: Japanese emerged with TQM, JIT, and employee involvement; there is still yet no one single approach for managing operations that replaced mass production:
- Flexible specialization: focus on separate parts; collaborate in network to build product
- Lean production: from Toyota Production System; elimination of all forms of waste; remove inefficiencies
- Mass customization: adapting products to meet individual customer&#8217;s requirements
- Agile manufacturing: always stay with the market&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The role of the operations manager&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Responsibilities:
- Human resource management
- Asset management
- Cost management&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Tasks/Decisions:
- design, manage, and improve the operations system&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This involves the processes, quality, quantity/capacity, inventory and HR.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A way to look at all of this is the transformation model.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Inputs -&gt; Transformation Process -&gt; Outputs -&gt; Feedback to Inputs&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Inputs include transformed (e.g. materials, information, customers) and transforming (staff/labour, facilities/capital) resources.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Outputs can vary widely and be both desired and undesirable (waste). They should also include ethical, environmental and social thinking in your operations management.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The transformation process often transforms materials, information and customers at the same time. You can categorize the different types into:
- manufacture (cars)
- transport (taxi service)
- supply (retailing)
- service (hospital wards, warehouses)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The macro transformation process is often made up of many micro transformation processes.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Feedback is essential for the operations manager, both from internal and external resources.
The boundary of operations systems is often used to show that there is a place where you loose control but you are influenced by your environment. It is becoming increasingly difficult to draw neat boundaries around the operations.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The process perspective to operations will give managers new insights about how performance can be improved with the help of operations. Operational processes are those that bring outputs to customers and administrative processes are those necessary for running the business but no direct outputs to customers. These two processes need to be linked because they rely on each other.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The work processes approach draws on the principles of quality improvement (incremental, existing processes are improved because they have desirable properties, everything must be documented with control points) and re-engineering (radical change, old processes regarded as hopelessly outdated, emphasis on redesign rather than control) to reduce cycle times, cut costs, improve quality and generally enhance operating performance. In general they suggest the work processes to be redesigned.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Case management (small teams see order from beginning to end) is only possible with new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;For managers the work processes approach is good because simple acknowledgment already helps and managers do not focus on structures on roles but on the process itself. Many problems come from only redesigning the process but not putting a good operations and management on top of it for the future. Sometimes the supporting administrative processes are neglected.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A very good theory on work process redesign came from Benson P. Shapiro, V. Kasturi Rangan and John J. Sviokla in form of the order management cycle (OMC). The moment of truth occurs at every step of the OMC and every employee is affected.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order planning: sales forecasting; capacity planning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost estimation and pricing: order based pricing is good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order receipt and entry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order selection and prioritization: You should prioritizing based on what is good for business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheduling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fulfilment: procurement; manufacturing; assembling; testing; shipping; installation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Billing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Returns and claims&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post-sales service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Horizontal moves are from department to department and are dangerous as things can fall through the cracks. The management often does not see the entire chains clearly and people only see their parts. These parts always overlap though. Everybody needs to be aware on where they fit and what their role is.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Remember that customers want their orders handled quickly, accurately, and cost-effectively, not more people to talk to. You need to look at the OMC from the customer&#8217;s point of view. Being aware of every step and all the problems means that means managers must walk up and down and from side to side, every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To succeed:
1. Analysis: Draw your OMC - and chart the gaps - from start to finish, detailed
Successful companies have explicitly stated that their goals are satisfied customers, higher profits, and sustainable competitive advantage without compromising any of them.
2. System Focus: put the pieces together and move across boundaries
Fit together the horizontal pieces into a unified, harmonious whole. The most powerful tool managers can use is inter-functional or interdepartmental investments in projects. You need to be clear that the basic work of the company takes place across boundaries. All pieces of the system must fit together to meet customer needs in a seamless fashion.
3. Political Strategy: Staple yourself to an order, follow it though&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In general a good OMC will improve customer satisfaction and help the company keep their promises to customers and eventually improve your financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Marketing as a job title: emphasis still on selling rather than satisfying customer needs.</p>

<p>Marketing department marketing: All marketing activities (advertising, sales, market research, &#8230;) grouped together in the marketing department. The focus is on increasing the customer&#8217;s understanding of existing products and services</p>

<p>Marketing as a Management process: Marketing as an exchange process/relationship. Marketing should help facilitate that mutually satisfying exchange.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>&quot;Marketing consists of individual and organizational activities that facilitate and expedite satisfying exchange relationships in a dynamic environment through the creation, distribution, promotion and pricing of goods, services and ideas.&quot; Dibb et al, 1997</p>

<p>This approach is what Piercy calls market-led, every department in the organization is involved.</p>

<p>&quot;Marketing is too important to leave to the marketing department&quot; - Bill Packard, Hewlet Packard, in Piercy, 1997</p>

<p>You need to take into account the needs of your markets before your plan your processes.</p>

<p>The market-led approach has three components:
- Customer orientation
- Competitor orientation
- Inter-functional co-ordination</p>

<p>&quot;Marketing is the management process of identifying, anticipating and satisfying customers&#8217; needs at a profit.&quot; Charter Institute of Marketing</p>

<p>You need to understand the difference between customers and consumers.</p>

<p>Customers: there is an exchange relationship that adds value to the organization
Consumers: there is no exchange relationship and do not give any value to the organization</p>

<p>&quot;Most people think that marketing is a tool, but for governments and not-for-profits it is a way of thinking. It goes beyond selling and advertising, it is a mindset that puts the customer first and ensures that the organization’s philosophy is &#8216;without consumers there is no organization&#8217;.&quot; - Kotler (Drucker, 1992)</p>

<p>Products and services have tangible (evaluated by intrinsic characteristics) and intangible (evaluated by extrinsic characteristics) elements. Salt is fully tangible, judged by taste. Teaching is fully intangible judged by extrinsic clues such as environment and teaching materials.</p>

<p>If you have more intangibility attached to a product or service then you move into High-Credence Qualities. You need to trust the person or company providing the service or product. This is called &#8216;fiduciary&#8217; responsibility, meaning &#8216;one who holds anything in trust&#8217;.</p>

<p>Drucker (1992) suggest that you need to ask yourself 5 questions to become market-led:
- What is our business?
- Who is our customer?
- What does our customer consider value?
- What have been our results?
- What is our plan?</p>

<p>Find your customers and then focus on providing superior value to them. Treacy and Wiersema (T&amp;W) suggest:
- choose your customers
- narrow your focus to provide a unique &#8216;value proposition&#8217; to your market
- dominate your market</p>

<p>You need to choose a group of customers and offer them superior value, the company&#8217;s value proposition. A unique value proposition needs a value-driven operating model. Market leaders often have value-driven cultures and:
- A long-term view
- External and internal networks to anticipate and respond to customer needs, listen closely, focus on customer satisfaction, build and sustain long-term relationships
If you use your value proposition and value-driven operating models right you will dominate your market.</p>

<p>T&amp;W found three  &#8216;value discipline&#8217;s that provide a unique value:</p>

<ul>
<li>Product leadership: push performance boundaries; the best product; continue to innovate; competition is about product excellence</li>
<li>Operational excellence: the no-frills approach; middle-of-the-market products at best price with the least inconvenience</li>
<li>Customer intimacy: what specific customers want; cultivate relationships; satisfying unique needs; we have the best solution for you</li>
</ul>


<p>Managing such a company needs to move from &#8216;marketing department marketing&#8217; to a value-driven culture where everybody is market oriented. Put all your customer data into one database.</p>

<p>&quot;Suppliers, shareholders, customers and employees are not rivals for the battle for profits - they are partners, and will be more successful once they learn to work together.&quot; - Egan and Thomas, 1998</p>

<p>In relationship marketing Piercy suggested looking at four relations. Those with:
- Competitors
- Customers
- Collaborators
- Co-workers</p>

<p>Millman suggested another approach in the six markets model. It splits this up a little further
(Competitors)
(Customers)
- Customer Markets
(Collaborator)
- Supplier Markets
- Referral Markets
- Influence Markets
(Co-Workers)
- Internal Markets
- Recruitment Markets</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An organized approach to thinking about performance includes the 4 &#8216;E&#8217;s: effectiveness, efficiency, economy and ethics.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Effectiveness (Do the right thing): How effectively does the company achieve their goals? For this you need to understand the purpose for which the company exists and their strategic goal, as performance is always in relation to this.</p>

<p>e.g.: In case of a school you need to understand the different goals each group of stakeholders have for the school.</p>

<p>Efficiency (Do the thing right): How efficiently does the company employ resources, transforms inputs into outputs?</p>

<p>Economy (Do it cheaply): How cheaply can the inputs be purchased?</p>

<p>Ethical (Do right): This looks at the performance of a company from the ethical perspective.</p>

<p>Measuring performance is important but very complex. Once you have found your strategy you should focus on those parts that are important in your strategy and include them in your performance measurement system. If customer support is crucial in your strategy then it needs to be a part of your performance analysis. &quot;What gets measured gets attention!&quot; (Robert Eccles).</p>

<p>In the past financials were crucial for measuring performance, especially earnings. Now analysts and companies are moving more to looking at the cash flow. On top of that financial information shows the past and not the future and nurtures short term thinking. But you need to find measures that, if improving, will predict a healthy long-term growth/success/profit/cash-flow/&#8230; .</p>

<p>Remember that this space is always evolving and so is your company. You should look at all your strategic goals, how they are interlinked and affect each other and use the tools at your disposal to an optimum.</p>

<p>All this interlinking shows the way for the rest of the modules in terms of looking at performance form the perspectives of Markets, Operations, Accounting and Finance, and People. The fifth perspective, Information, overlays the other four.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We just returned from the Cologne Zoo, which is currently still collecting money for the new Elephant park. Based on what you can already see it will be magnificent. The weather outside is beautiful at the moment and we had a wonderful time. Some of the pictures I wanted to share here, are from the washing of the elephants and some turned out quite nice.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>There were two elephants there at the time and they had clear different preferences. The older one liked going into the water (but was old enough to know that she could wait for apples to be thrown in by the guards ;)) and the younger one liked to be washed.</p>

<p><a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/001-in-out.jpg">&lt;img alt=&quot;001-in-out.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/001-in-out-thumb.jpg&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;</a></p>

<p><a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/002-want-that-apple.jpg">&lt;img alt=&quot;002-want-that-apple.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/002-want-that-apple-thumb.jpg&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;</a></p>

<p>The younger one sat there silently, while the older one was getting very close, eating some grass and flowers.</p>

<p><a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/003-blast-that-ass.jpg">&lt;img alt=&quot;003-blast-that-ass.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/003-blast-that-ass-thumb.jpg&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;</a>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;<a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/004-eating.jpg">&lt;img alt=&quot;004-eating.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/004-eating-thumb.jpg&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;466&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;</a></p>

<p>Then they finished off by turning themselves around to have the water on them just the right way. You could see they were enjoying themselves.</p>

<p><a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/005-ahhhh.jpg">&lt;img alt=&quot;005-ahhhh.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/005-ahhhh-thumb.jpg&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;</a></p>

<p>The older one, 56 years old (oldest one in Europe, 40 is what they get on average in the wild), could even wash herself all on her own!</p>

<p><a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/006-self-washing.jpg">&lt;img alt=&quot;006-self-washing.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/blog/images/006-self-washing-thumb.jpg&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;466&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;a title=&quot;U.S. warns Canada against easing pot laws&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/05/02/us_pot_rxn030502&quot;&gt;CBC News: U.S. warns Canada against easing pot laws&lt;/a&gt;. How much fun this will be to watch. Very harsh words from the US there and it&#8217;s an interesting move on the part of Canada.</p>

<p>The Netherlands here let you buy pot in special shops and of course, many germans go over there to buy it. The thing is, here in germany, while it is not legal, the police is advised to not go after people who only have small quantities for personal use. They can take it, but that&#8217;s like it, if even that. Let&#8217;s see what happens with the US and Canada now ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I once again finished reading a book. I might have to revisit it from time to time though because the content is complex and challenging. It fits wonderfully with my current MBA course &quot;Strategy&quot; though. The book my am talking about is &quot;Strategy Safari&quot; by Henry Mintzberg, Bruce Ahlstrand and Joseph Lampel. Without writing too much here, the book talks about the following strategy formation schools:</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Design School (think SWOT ;)), is about finding a match between internal capabilities and external possibilities. You design your strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>The Planning School: &quot;formal procedure, formal training, formal analysis, lots of numbers.&quot; As they put it in the book: &quot;Take the SWOT model, devide it into neatly delineated steps, articulate each of these with lots of checklists and techniques, and give special attention to the setting of objectives at the front end and the elaboration of budgets and operating plans on the back end.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>The Positioning School: Something very famous from this are Porter&#8217;s generic strategies and his five forces model as well as the value chain. You need to position yourself well in relation to your environment.</p></li>
<li><p>The Entrepreneurial School: There you have a visionary. That&#8217;s practically it ;)</p></li>
<li><p>The Cognitive School: This one is more psychology. The idea is that you don&#8217;t have one set environment. We shape our environment based on how we look at it, what our experiences are and what else currently is going on within us. You can&#8217;t say &quot;this is how it is&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>The Learning School is first of all very en mode at the moment and second &#8230; Mintzberg is a very big supporter. So it&#8217;s covered a lot. Good reading. The idea: You learn over time. Enable learning.</p></li>
<li><p>The Power School: We long for power. Some have it, some don&#8217;t. Sometimes a company has power to shape a market. Power is important. Hence &#8230; The Power School.</p></li>
<li><p>The Cultural School: You can&#8217;t do something on your own in a company. There is a culture that has deep routes and you can&#8217;t just change it with the flick of a switch.</p></li>
<li><p>The Environmental School: Here not you are the actor, the environment is.</p></li>
<li><p>The Configuration School: &quot;All of the above&quot; You configure and you transform. You take the best of all worlds.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In the last chapter they integrate everything a bit again, saying though, that the real integration happens in the head of the reader. They can&#8217;t force that. It&#8217;s really good to read and I like it that they critique every single school and also look at the weak sides. It&#8217;s a very good overview of where Strategy Formation has been and where it is going to. Now I will have to see how much of this is covered in the MBA Course &#8230; or how much more ;)</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: Ok, the book was very good and the course seems to be very thorough and covers lot of ground. This will be interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Brand Eins is a very good german magazine and they have partnered with McKinsey to bring a special series focussing on subjects like Change, Risk, Knowledge, and other fields. In the most recent one, labled restart, there was an article about the European Molecular Biology Laboratory ( <a href="http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/">EMBL</a> ). The EMBL was founded 1974 to let the best researchers of 16 Member Countries work on the basis of biology. The system is set up to flow from idea to invention/discovery, patenting to the &quot;Start Up&quot;. The article is very interesting on it&#8217;s own but why I post here is <a href="http://www.cellzome.com/">Cellzome</a>, one of the companies who&#8217;s foundation comes from EMBL. It&#8217;s said to change the world, or so they say. From their own web site, it&#8217;s a little less interesting, which is good as they are still small and shouldn&#8217;t scream out that they are allmighty. For anyone interesting in biotechnology, this might be an interesting target to watch though. They just finished round C finanzing and will likely go public eventuelly and that&#8217;s something to keep an eye on I&#8217;d say.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;Founded at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory ( EMBL ), Cellzome has combined scientific leadership with pharmaceutical industry management. Some of the biotech industry&#8217;s most experienced investors, with a track record of building successful companies, form Cellzome&#8217;s Supervisory Board.</p>

<p>Cellzome&#8217;s technological breakthrough in large scale proteomics exploits the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s accumulated medicinal chemistry knowledge to mine the human genome for the systematic discovery of new Lead|Target pairs for important diseases.</p>

<p>An international team of 100 researchers based in Heidelberg, Germany, and London, UK, is focused on building an innovative drug discovery process that will generate a strong pipeline of drug candidates.</p>

<p>This unique combination of scientific excellence, pharmaceutical industry leadership and biotech industry financial expertise, is driving a company focused on the need to significantly improve drug discovery productivity and create novel medicines. &lt;/I&gt;</p>

Seems like I will not be able to give Apple my money for the living of my consumer music responsibility. I would have liked to try it out as the system looks very nice. But hey, that&#8217;s how life goes when you are in Germany. While I am at it, I have a request for spammers. Stop sending me stuff that I can&#8217;t use anyway damn it! I can&#8217;t read chinese! I don&#8217;t have a house. I don&#8217;t feel fat. I don&#8217;t need your latest 1000% in 2 days stock idea! Ok, that was that. Feeling better now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fast Company has a very good article on Nokia&#8217;s ability to innovate. They are churning out phones faster than anyone else, but didn&#8217;t really need to grow for doing it. They have split up in business units who are responsible for themselves including their own marketing. They have teams of people going arround looking for disruptive technologies inside and outside of nokia. This is a company looking for products that will eventuelly kill it&#8217;s business! &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/70/smartcompany.html&quot;&gt;Read On&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: This seems to be Nokia day. Here is another article, this time in CFO Europe, about Nokia&#8217;s CFO Kallasvuo and R&amp;D and Financials and much more. <a href="http://www.cfoeurope.com/200304b.html">Check it out!</a></p>
