  <div class="entry-content"><p>I returned from a wonderful week in Tunisia yesterday. I had a wonderful time, read a lot, stopped thinking a lot, didn&#8217;t decide a lot&#8230; and all that with great weather. I posted <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/photos/tunisia_2004/index.html">some photos</a>, without people as these would not belong here, to give you an idea of the place in case you are wondering about going. Doesn&#8217;t show much more than the hotel though. :) As said, I didn&#8217;t do a lot and moving out of the hotel would have required a decision, which I was trying to avoid at all cost, at least those that require decision more than 1 minute in advance. I am already half back, so some slow posting for another week until I am back fully. Life is good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fast Company has a very good article about Jeff Bezos entitled <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/85/bezos_1.html">&lt;i&gt;Inside the Mind of Jeff Bezos&lt;/i&gt;</a> and I highly suggest you read it. It resonates clearly with me currently as it is one of the things that shows that customer focus is key. And not want-to-be customer focus. Real customer focus, above everything else. Yes, you have to manage that customer focus. You have to know your numbers. But at the end, what counts is customer focus. It also strikes me because he keeps teams fairly small and nimble and quick. Google does the same. This is something that needs to be thought of when building up a company structure. We still think in hierarchies, and to a small bit we need them, but overall, you need to give people the power to change their work environment and engage the customer and make a difference. We don&#8217;t really care for a higher title as long as we can do things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever since I started to read <a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/">his blog</a> I got intrigued by <a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/">Loic</a>&#8217;s thought processes, hightened when I met him some time back. He is not the most inventive guy, I mean <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joi</a> introduced him to blogging, but when it comes to innovation, connecting ideas and their potential effects, especially in the business world, he stands tall. He is also an amazing communicator, a true entrepreneur. Now he added another post in his series about founding a company and I have to say that it&#8217;s a must read for all those that think business is about not making mistakes (read <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/07/the_power_of_ma.html">here</a> for my view on that one) and for those feeling that blogging is just a fad (see <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2002/11/blogging_goes_w.html">here</a> for my article on wireless blogging from 2002).</p>

<p>So for all those doubters: &lt;a title=&quot;Start a business - 7: Entrepreneurs do make mistakes, learn from them and react.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I tried out <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> for real finally and I actually put some money on my SkypeOut account, allowing me to call landline phones. The quality is really very good. I do like it. Mobile phones is not something you want to be calling really but landline is very cool. I mean 1.4 cents per minute to call the USA is nice. These people will rule the world, at least partly, if they take it up the right way now. And calling Skype users is even free from PC to PC, of course. Contact me if you want my username. You can also get it if you link in via <a href="http://www.openbc.com/">OpenBC</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, Google has <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;amp;u=/nm/20040726/ts_nm/tech_google_ipo_dc_7">announced their price</a> (thanks for the link <a href="http://www.hebig.com/">Heiko</a>). It&#8217;s simply funny, nothing more to say there really. I got a valuation <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/05/my_own_google_v.html">close to $38 Billion</a> some time back in my own calculation, but it was based on the most positive scenario. Somebody wants to make some serious money there. Oh the downfall will be fun. At that valuation Google is valued at about the same amount as Yahoo! and only 10 Billion USD below eBay and both of these have a real business model, especially eBay! I still want to see the Google business model because AdWords can&#8217;t be it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Joi <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/07/21/seth_godins_changethis.html">made me aware</a> of <a href="http://www.changethis.com/">ChangeThis</a>, which is starting something that I do really like. The thing is that blogs just publish short bursts of thoughts but do not provide detailed analysis. If you post detailed analysis it is often not even fully read because it doesn&#8217;t fit the short bursts mentality. Now with ChangeThis, the founders are providing a platform for serious thought that builds on the Creative Commons idea in that I can republish the document. It&#8217;s like getting great authors without a platform and a platform without authors together. NY Times without the backend. It&#8217;s be interesting, but I feel like there is still more to be done with leveraging RSS and Blogs. We need a way to interconnect all the different blogs and voices to make a bigger picture automatically via the many  voices that we can find. Maybe autosummaries like possible on any text document on the Mac, coupled with Technorati and subject searches, might enable that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lawrence Lessig has a <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/002046.shtml">wonderful post</a> that to me shows the power that is available within the idea of blogging with the help of RSS. Somebody with a great voice can now get the message out that somebody some TV Channel or rather TV Channel Host does is not right and he gets people thinking. Yes, the right and left wing of the political spectrum will always have a voice on the internet. Radicals always get their voice heard, and if only because they are louder than the rest. But now there will be a very easy counter-voice that anyone can have. We just need to make sure that this blogging thing will have an interconnectedness that will help readers take in the diversity that is out there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a <a href="http://www.typeblog.de/archiv/2004/07/movable_type_31.html">very nice post on TypePost</a> (German), giving some details on MovableType 3.1. The most interesting, beyond sub-categories, which is very nice, is that it will have a DynamicEngine, meaning that you can decide to not rebuild the site but have it be rendered live. Very cool indeed that is. On top of that, you can just include PHP modules, which is something I already did in my previous installation though. You can just make MT publish PHP code without a problem. What is likely improved is the potential to get some extra hooks into your PHP code that makes it interact with the MT installation. Very nice indeed. Possibly a result from <a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2004/06/mt_and_wordpres.html">the Wordpress - Six Apart meetup</a>, but that&#8217;s full speculation on my part. :)</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: Nice additional info from <a href="http://birdhouse.org/blog/archives/001380.php">Scot&#8217;s post about it</a> from no one else than <a href="http://www.anildash.com/">Anil Dash</a>:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;We&#8217;ll be explaining more on this soon, but the PHP integration in MT3.1 makes use of Smarty, so the caching of dynamic templates is pretty smart.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>This came as a reply to a question by <a href="http://www.transpontine.com/blog/">Erwin</a> about only scanning templates for PHP code once and then not doing this until they are changed again. This is really what Smarty does so Anil&#8217;s comment does make some sense.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://blog.fastcompany.com/">Fast Company Now</a> has a very nice post as a summary from BlogOn talking about <a href="http://blog.fastcompany.com/archives/2004/07/23/business_transparency.html">business transparency</a>. It starts with the good side, in the sense that Microsoft is currently opening up and they are making huge progress with <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a>. This site has over 700k visitors a month. It&#8217;s huge. It has endless amounts of videos of Microsoft workers (<a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=114">great example</a>), from within Campus, the Wiki of the IETeam is on there, lots of great stuff. But there is also a bad side, seen in the MovableType pricing wars as well as in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2004/07/22/191629.aspx#FeedBack">this thread of comments on the IE Team blog</a> (thanks <a href="http://ensight.org/">Jeremy</a>). As always there is an upside and a downside. It&#8217;s your decision to make it work or leave it be. I&#8217;d always be for the big hairy audacious goal, so I&#8217;d try to make it work.</p>
