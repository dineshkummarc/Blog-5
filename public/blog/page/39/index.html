  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;So I received my FON router last friday and I just wanted to quickly let the world know what my experience was. The thing is that it is a real first adopters device, so beware if you want to order one.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In the box is a short documentation of what you have to do and that is the first thing. It is really short and you really only have one option. Set-up the router behind your normal router, because the thing has to be online very fast. You boot it up, it gets its IP from your earlier router, you are connected to the FON router with your system though. Then you quickly launch a browser and it loads a FON registration page. There you will have to enter your user information and you will get an eMail allowing you to authenticate yourself as the owner of that router, or rather his MAC address. All this has to happen in 5 minutes or your Router will have to be turned off and on again. It worked after the third try. Finally online with my FON router.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;But I could not access the router interface anymore. This is where you have to find out that they added some security patches to the system and now you can only open the interface of the system on the FON router via a network port and not via the WiFi interface. Oh well, once that was found out, I could get in. The interface is nicely done but a little low on features. It does allow you to set up PPPoE though and so I did. Here you should remember that saving those setting doesn&#8217;t suffice, but you will need to also Apply them. Then again, that didn&#8217;t do much good because I did not get the router to dial in via PPPoE. It might be trying, but I wouldn&#8217;t know because there isn&#8217;t a log anywhere to be found and I couldn&#8217;t connect via SSH to it anymore to look through the file system.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So I am back using two routers, which does work, but seems a bit stupid. I am hoping to eventually get some feedback from FON through the Forums. Mailing them at info@fon.com has not had any result for another question and the people in the forum say they weren&#8217;t really successful either. The Forum seems to be filled with users and not much else. All in all, FON seems to have fallen victim to their own success and are probably trying to hire like crazy. They seem to be getting sales people on board quickly but I&#8217;d really like them to hire a very good support guy that manages their call center or at least monitors the Forum.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The price for the router still comes out great and if you are wondering if you can use it without being with FON, it seems that you can <a href="http://www.twindx.com/node/106">hack your FON router</a> (<a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=2573">source</a>) to make it ping FON periodically to say you are still using their system. We&#8217;ll see how long that works and it&#8217;s probably not something you really want or need to be doing. The system seems to work great as it is and I am looking forward to the software in Version 1.0, as it&#8217;s still 0.6, signifying at least a certain degree of beta status.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;We&#8217;ll see how that story continues.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oh the colors at night. I took my camera with me when going for a short shopping trip. I seem to have just missed the DHL guy bringing me my new Puma shoes (they didn&#8217;t have my size in the shop.) by the way, but not that that matters. This is about the photos I took and they have only been marginally edited if that. Using a bit of underexposure on the camera was a good deal to get the dark colors out of the shots.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once again, there is proof that Germany is different, this time on the positive side, which is often forgotten. Wal-Mart <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,403857,00.html">seems to have</a> made a loss of a hundred million or more last year. Numbers aren&#8217;t being published but this is what Spiegel writes. They are also closing stores. People of Wal-Mart, you might be the master of cheap in the US, but we are the masters of cheap period! With good quality to boot!</p>

<p>I mean Wal-Mart came here with their strategy of huge mega stores with cheap stuff, and forgot that we have Aldi (and Lidl) and there is a reason the Aldi brothers are guessed to be among the richest in the world. Aldi is built from the ground up to be able to offer things cheaply. They have for example a lot less different products than a normal super market, hence buy in bigger volume hence get cheaper prices. Wal-Mart wasn&#8217;t able to beat the prices or the brand. We actually like real quality too, just that we take it for cheap. MediaMarkt and Saturn are the two biggest electronics shops in Germany and they belong to the same mother company and hence do their buying together. That&#8217;s buying power that dwarfs that of Wal-Mart.</p>

<p>Dell actually has a similar problem for all I know. They are gaining in the corporate sector but cheap PCs for the average Joe are around the corner here. I am telling people that for a Laptop, if they don&#8217;t take an Apple, they should take Dell, because there a real brand behind it helps. But for standard PCs, you can just as well go to Aldi, which will guy a few hundred thousand Medion PCs and sell them cheap every once in a while.</p>

<p>It again proves that you need a really different value proposition in your target market to succeed and Wal-Mart and partly Dell, just don&#8217;t cut it. Dell could be gaining at the moment though, so don&#8217;t take my word for granted. I just know Dell exchanged their German head several times already in the past.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Google AdSense Blog has a <a href="http://adsense.blogspot.com/2006/02/ecpm-what-exactly-is-that.html">good post on eCPM</a> for those wondering how advertisement is paid. The general thing is that CPM, cost per 1000 impressions of advertisements (cost per mille to be exact), is a very good way to measure the success of a web site. My personal blog is in the 1 digit eCPM via AdSense while the <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a> is in the double digits for example. The thing is though that just because it is a good way to measure like this, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a good way to be paid in that form. But this will develop over the next years and with TV, radio, newspapers, &#8230; being digitized it will happen there too. And attached to that are a million of cool opportunities.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Martin <a href="http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/">posted</a> on how FON talks with ISPs and with it revealed some good infos about pricing structures for all those business minded people listening in. At first, ISPs are sceptical&#8230;</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;But when we have our foot in the door and we explain exactly how Fon increases ARPU and reduces churn, ISPs do a 180 on us.  The key here is our rules.  First on prices.  Fon will charge aliens (paying customers who pay because they have not donated wifi) $2 in the States and 2 euros in Europe.  This rate is a bargain for 24 hours.  With this rate we become the &quot;easy jet&quot; of wifi.  But interestingly this rate is not low enough to get a neighbor to want to connect through another neighbor.  In France for example you get good monthly broadband connections for 22 euros per month.  So at 2 euros per day it just does not pay to be an alien.&lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>So in the end it&#8217;s about taking all your stakeholders into account in your pricing strategy. FON could go lower than 2 EURs, and that might be one of their week points. Other providers of WiFi access points might be able to go lower, but FON has a hard time doing it, because that&#8217;s one of the good sale points with ISP because of the point made by Martin above. If they would go lower than it would make sense for me to sit together with my neighbors and let them all use my box via the standard FON way (with just giving them access of course being illegal in any case).</p>

<p>One thing I do not fully understand from his post, which will probably become clearer once I have my box, which should be in the next few days is how much they can pay when. If I am a Linus, so offering my box free to other Linuses, then the ISP will obviously not get money for Linuses accessing my box, or do they? If I connect as a Linus to a Bill box, I need to pay $2. If a Bill accesses my box he has to pay $2. Aliens obviously always pay. So the only downside is clearly that a T-Online Linus and a Arcor Linus will be able to share each others bandwidth. But hey, they both do have DSL, so that&#8217;s probably ok for the ISP because more people might get DSL if it gives them a roaming account right with it.</p>

<p>If I understand Martin&#8217;s post correctly &#8230; after reading it one more time, the revenue sharing he is talking about is that if a Bill or Alien connects to my box the ISP gets 50% and FON 50%, so I get nothing, but I do get the roaming. A Bill would get 50%, with ISP and FON each getting 25%. So in this case, there is a virtual cost connected with being a Linus, and I would have to see how many people connect to my box and choose to be a Bill or Linus accordingly. If I get a lot of connections, charging money will be worth more than the few roaming days. My first idea, in that revenue always goes to the box owner first, if it is generated via his box, actually sounds more logical. Then Linuses are just an additional community above the Fonero community. We will see soon enough.
