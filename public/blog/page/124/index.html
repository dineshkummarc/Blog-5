  <div class="entry-content"><p>So what does a VC want answered, and answered quickly? Check out: &lt;a title=&quot;The Torturous World of Powerpoint&quot; href=&quot;http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2004/06/the_torturous_w.html&quot;&gt;Feld Thoughts: The Torturous World of Powerpoint&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a wonderful list of questions that a VC wants answered in a simple and easy way. This is actually inspired by the idea that Powerpoint is bad, but I like it that Brad Feld gives you a good idea of what should be in a powerpoint, leaving the reader to adapt this on how best to present the answers. good read and interesting to see what&#8217;s on a VC&#8217;s mind.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wired just had a story in their magazine called &quot;The Wired.40&quot;, which was about the masters of innovation, technology and strategic vision as they put it. The &quot;40 companies driving the global economy.&quot; What better place to look for the future investment? Actually, it would be better if nobody else knew about this list but that&#8217;s not going to happen. These are all highly covered companies, that will not suddenly jumb up in price because some analysts find out about them. Still, if they are really about the future, then this is a good place to look. So here comes my analysis of this list. Read more.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Google
Ok, we&#8217;ll have to wait for the IPO and above that it will likely be priced high upon the public offering, which is good for the company, so all fine by me. On top of that, most revenue comes from Adwords and a big part of that from AdSense and a problem I still see with that is that it could be hacked to pieces. I think they have some cool things up their sleves and I still love using their stuff, but I am not sure if it is a good investment.</p></li>
<li><p>Amazon
Huge, big, profitable, amazing business model, amazing pull through. But too late for me to invest now, especially as niche players might take some of their market as it becomes easier on the net to switch around and word of mouth grows. But, I do believe their API strategy, to allow anyone to integrate their store system is a very good one. Their P/E is too high in relation to their tiny margin I&#8217;d say.</p></li>
<li><p>Apple Computer
Very good company, very focussed. I like it. But I just don&#8217;t have a good feeling in my stomach. I don&#8217;t see the amazing road ahead. A good one, but not amazing.</p></li>
<li><p>Genentech
I actually looked at that company when I was still active at Motley Fool, but then I figured that I didn&#8217;t understand the drug market good enough to invest there. I opted for investing in Sal. Oppenheim&#8217;s Pharma wHealth fund, which investing in the space and is run by Sal. Oppenheim together with several pharma consulting companies. I am starting to get more and more of an idea that Genentech really has found a very good model for research and development. Also, with a of below 100 and margins of almost 20%, they might be interesting. &lt;b&gt;To be looked at.&lt;/b&gt;</p></li>
<li><p>eBay
Should have invested there ages ago. I still don&#8217;t think they can grow tremendously. There is a great article in FastCompany this time about a consultant team working with them currently to find out what they are about. They have to find something new now to focus their employees and continue to grow. Simply being an auction platform isn&#8217;t enough. They are opening their API now too though so that others can use their system. Now this excites me! &lt;b&gt;To be looked at.&lt;/b&gt;</p></li>
<li><p>Samsung Electronics
That&#8217;s a giant. They have a great marketing planning system based on a very good article in Harvard Business Review, but other than that they are a giant and I have no clue whatsoever where the profits come from in reality. So this is a nogo.</p></li>
<li><p>Yahoo!
Big. Overture is nice but has some problems to get into the contextual advertising market. Not sure here on what their future brings. Sure, the advertising market will rebound, but that&#8217;s about it.</p></li>
<li><p>Electronic Arts
Very nice. But gaming is too volatile for me, especially as it moves more into the movie direction, making it even more volatile.</p></li>
<li><p>Pixar
Great stuff, but with spitting of of Disney, there is too much stuff unsure now for me. I love their movies and I&#8217;d love to go to a movie knowing parts of the money I spent come back to me, but this didn&#8217;t work well with my McDonalds investment&#8230; so. Nope, thanks.</p></li>
<li><p>Cisco Systems
A giant, again. And a giant with lots of product lines and so on. They seem to be very good but I&#8217;m sticking with F5 Networks for banking on traffic to be needed to be managed more effectively in the future, as more and more people get online. No thanks.</p></li>
<li><p>Infosys Technologies
Didn&#8217;t know that one yet. They are an outsources of IT, including development, to far away countries with lower salaries. &lt;b&gt;Needs to be investigated.&lt;/b&gt;</p></li>
<li><p>Dell Computer
Amazing company that one, period. Too big for me to invest in at this time as I don&#8217;t really see them going anywhere really soon. Maybe this is just a feeling because they have problems getting into Germany. We have an established system of very cheap PCs that even Dell can&#8217;t compete with.</p></li>
<li><p>IBM
Already invested there and thinking about some more. I mean this is a powerhouse! XBox has PowerPCs. Cell stuff with Sony for the next Playstation. Apple for their wonderful laptops. Big servers. Small servers. Consulting. Outsourcing. The works. I have no clue how they make money but they just can&#8217;t not do it. This is like a safe investment that will still be there in 40 years.</p></li>
<li><p>SAP
With the horror stories of SAP integration. No way.</p></li>
<li><p>Nokia
Already in there and I would be thinking about more if I wouldn&#8217;t already have a lot in there. They have a bit of problems now, but that will change.</p></li>
<li><p>Netflix
Too much competition going into the space. Nope.</p></li>
<li><p>Monsanto
I remember a friend saying that without gene modified soja, we wouldn&#8217;t have the chicken volume we are eating in this world. And he knows, he is responsible for selling this stuff in Europe. So these things are interesting. &lt;b&gt;Probably worth a look.&lt;/b&gt;</p></li>
<li><p>Toyota Motors
While I do love Toyota from a focus perspective, it&#8217;s just nothing I&#8217;d invest in. It&#8217;s an automative company. That&#8217;s dull. ;)</p></li>
<li><p>Vodafone Group
Already in there. I truely believe in the wireless future, and while I believe T-Mobile is kicking their butt in Germany, you can neither invest in T-Mobile directly at this time, nor are they as big world wide. &lt;B&gt;Possibly adding a bit&lt;/b&gt;</p></li>
<li><p>Flextronics
I thought about them time and time again and maybe it&#8217;s time to closer look at the numbers. Here it would be important to think about who will build their stuff themselves, and who won&#8217;t. Who might be their customer. Will they have more. &lt;B&gt;To be looked at.&lt;/b&gt;</p></li>
<li><p>Interactivecorp
Ok, they are buying up property left and right. Internet property that is. I have to at least understand that. &lt;B&gt;To be looked at.&lt;/B&gt;</p></li>
<li><p>NVidia
This is a space I don&#8217;t get. Sorry. Enlighten me why they would be someone to invest in. Why this space would be something to invest in.</p></li>
<li><p>WPP Group
Too much uncertainty here. Too much that would be needed to be found out.</p></li>
<li><p>Intel
Too big already.</p></li>
<li><p>EMC
Nope. While I do believe in storage management, this just isn&#8217;t something I want to invest in. There are too many different ways to manage storage and if the distributed PCs ala Google will take off in the future, then why do I need a big storage system?</p></li>
<li><p>Fedex
Hey, I am in the country of the German Post. I can&#8217;t possibly invest in something foreign can I? Ok, joking, but still. I don&#8217;t think I want to go there.</p></li>
<li><p>Microsoft
Too big. Still a potentially amazing company to work for.</p></li>
<li><p>Pfizer
Too big.</p></li>
<li><p>Costco Wholesale
Don&#8217;t know them over here in Germany. So it&#8217;s hard to invest in something you do not know at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Comcast
Not sure. I do believe in VoIP but there must be a better investment there than somebody owning the lines.</p></li>
<li><p>Taiwan Semiconductor
I don&#8217;t want to go in the semiconductur area at this time.</p></li>
<li><p>Ameritrade
Nope.</p></li>
<li><p>Gen-Probe
Didn&#8217;t know that one at all. &lt;B&gt;To be looked at.&lt;/b&gt;</p></li>
<li><p>Ryanair
Nope. I looked at low cost carriers for the MBA once. Hell of an industry.</p></li>
<li><p>L-3
No military stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Citigroup
Too big a bank. It&#8217;s more like an institution. :)</p></li>
<li><p>Level 3
They might have their network glow if VoIP takes off. Hmmm&#8230; Interesting. &lt;B&gt;To be looked at.&lt;/B&gt;</p></li>
<li><p>Inditex
Oh, that&#8217;s Zara. I like their value chain and their amazing speed at getting stuff into the stores but other than that. Nope.</p></li>
<li><p>JDS Uniphase
Nope</p></li>
<li><p>BP
Nope.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So this gives me some companies to look at. More to follow as soon as I find the time to look at one. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;In this chapter it is about our preference of working an behaving in particular ways. To find this out you can either observe, ask others or fill out inventories to assess your style. Referred to here are: NEO personality traits, MBTI psychological types, KAI creativy style, LSI learning style and Belbin team roles, as they re widely used, studied and recognized. They are measures of preferences, and hence there is no good or bad answer.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Goldman (1993) subsumed the various personality traits under five traits. The &quot;Big Five&quot;: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional stability, Intellect or openness. These all seem to be based on a genetic tendency, meaning that we are born with them, at least falling back on our style when we are under pressure. The solution then is to recognize your style and work with it.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Tests for the &quot;big five&quot; are still being developed, but NEO-PI-R personality tests seem to be very sound.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;MBTI Types&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a commonly used system. You can find lots of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;c2coff=1&amp;amp;q=MBTI+Test&amp;amp;btnG=Search">MBTI Tests</a> online if you want to do one. The system includes four opposing preferences:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Extraversion (E) - Introversion (I)
Sensing (S) - Intuition (N)
Thinking (T) - Feeling (F)
Judging (J) - Perceiving (P)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;These together form sixteen personality types. In relation to the &quot;big five&quot; you can see a relation between:
- E-I (available in both)
- T-F &#8211; agreeableness
- P-J &#8211; conscientiousness
- S-N &#8211; openness&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Each style will likely adopt different styles of working, communication and problem solving, which needs to be recognized to get along. There is a lot of information about this in the tables from page 105ff. For deeper analysis these are a must read. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In terms of temperament STs are analytical and fact driven, leading to the fact that some two-thirds of accountants are of that type. The different approach by the different types, also leads to a cognitive bias, to things that that type more easily ignores. This is especially important in looking at your own problems.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Adaptors and Innovators&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Kirton&#8217;s Adaption-Innovation Theory (KAI) refers to the preferred thinking style in relation to decision making and creativity. More adaptive people are into improving, doing things better, while innovative people are focussing on reframing problems, offering new solutions doing things differently. Adaptive people will do a more thorough search in relation to one idea, while innovators will probably formulate different possibilities. Adaptors might be the ones that also can recognize their errors though, in relation to Innovators, who may even be intolerant in relation to other ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In terms of techniques for creativity, adaptors prefer structures and conventional ways, while innovators prefer less conventional techniques. (Based on innovators mostly being the first adopters, technology wise I am an innovator, damn ;))&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Kirton emphasized though that this results in different styles, not different capacities, levels or abilities of creativity. Your style can also be adapted in relation to your environment, but will likely fall back to their natural style. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The KAI Inventory is short  and new AI theory suggest that this style is also relative, meaning that your result will have a different meaning based on your current environment.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Learning style&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There is also different research on learning styles by Kolb (1984, learning style inventory - LSI) or Honey and Mumford (1985, LSQ). Kolb described four types: divergers, assimilators, convergers and accommodators. You can also mix them with MBTI types, which was going to deep into it for my tast. Reflective divergers and assimilators think before they act, and active accomondators and convergers act before they think.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In general, there are two axis in Kolp&#8217;s model, that are preferences for learning, between reflections and action as well as contrete experience versus abstract conceptualization. A mix of these axis lead to the four types. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This chapter can lead to a lot of more reading if you are not careful ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

It&#8217;s a Bed designed by Max Longin and it kind of hangs in the air, movable, only attached via 4 strings. To translate the german page: &quot;This progressive sleepingplace doesn&#8217;t inhibit the movements of lying or loving, but balances them out, leading them peace.&quot; The bed costs almost 4000 EURs.</p>

<p>So for 4000 EURs you can have the earth moving whenever you turn arround in your sleep. And then you have the &quot;loving&quot; bit, which might be a lot more interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okok, that&#8217;s overdoing it a little bit. RSS won&#8217;t kill blogging, it might even make it more interesting. This has come to my mind with the recent problems on what I could be blogging today. The thing is, someone already wrote something about some happening somewhere I, and possibly you, might be interested in. And with RSS, it&#8217;s even likely that you&#8217;re reading their blogs! While I don&#8217;t read Slashdot regularly, I wonder over from time to time (Important Note: Ignore the comments! ;)) and today I found that <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/06/22/0222210&amp;amp;mode=nested&amp;amp;tid=137&amp;amp;tid=179&amp;amp;tid=185&amp;amp;tid=190">Apple seems to have sold a 1566 dual CPU 1U XServe cluster</a>! Now that&#8217;s a nice group of servers. Still wondering what I should do with some leftover GMail invites, I read <a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/002236.shtml">Heiko&#8217;s GMail story</a> and can only agree with him. The idea of artificial shortage that Google is creating in relation to GMail, makes the service so much more interesting. On top of that, I can never stop suggesting to read <a href="http://sociablemedia.typepad.com/beyond_bullets/">Beyond Bullets</a>, with two recent posts being amazing again: <a href="http://sociablemedia.typepad.com/beyond_bullets/2004/06/fading_to_black.html">Gridlock Vision</a> and your <a href="http://sociablemedia.typepad.com/beyond_bullets/2004/06/your_visual_bio.html">Visual Bio</a>, which is something I have to try (next to finally going to a Toastmasters event).</p>

<p>But if you have been listening to me you are likely already checking out what Heiko has to say as well as Beyond Bullets. So I shouldn&#8217;t have posted all this, and didn&#8217;t add any real value. Tough luck! :)</p>

There is no a real site about it and it is starting to get some real feedback. Of course, launching a real magazin is not an easy task but this might be working, or at least something that will end up being very similar. I suggest you go on over there and take part in the discussion. Everyone is welcome to post or comment. I have been trying to get my voice heard several times already when this thing started and I think more voices need to be heard.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I seem to be liking this Dan Brown guy. This is the second book I read from him and I have to say that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671027387/bizkiffer-20">Deception Point</a> didn&#8217;t let me down. I started Friday and was done Sunday evening, during a busy weekend. Dan is very good at story telling and giving you a good feel for the characters while the plot twists and turns. This, and the added benefit that it&#8217;s full of interesting technology, makes this a wonderful book for me. If you are not interesting in special surveilance machinery and science, this again isn&#8217;t really your book. But if you are, you&#8217;ll be happy reading this. Not as good as <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/05/review_the_da_v.html">The Da Vinci Code</a>, but a wonderful read non the less.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For all those that haven&#8217;t gotten used to using RSS instead of eMail for stuff remotely similar to newsletters, like blogging, I am happy to say that I set up a bloglet that allows you to subscribe to my posts via eMail. You will find it at the right side of both this blog and the <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a> and can choose to subscribe to either one. Subscribing will result in you getting an eMail once a day about everything that is new on these two sites. If you prefer to be updated more regularly, then subscribe to the RSS feeds via <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>. Everyone have a great weekend.</p>
