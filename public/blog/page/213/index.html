  <div class="entry-content"><p>Scott Blum, 38, buy.com
He&#8217;s ba-a-ack! In 1999, Blum sold his controlling interest in buy.com, the discount e-tailer he founded, to a Japanese investment bank for $230 million. &quot;I got ridiculed for selling,&quot; he says, &quot;but I felt the market was getting out of control. The company was trading at a $5 billion market cap.&quot; The bubble soon burst, and in late 2001 a deep-pocketed Blum was able to buy the now-profitable company back for a mere $26 million.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on infoSync) Why am I making such a blunt statement, you ask? Because I just installed Jaguar, the newest version of Apple&amp;rsquo;s OS X operating system. Right about now, many of you are likely to ask yourself what the heck I&#8217;m talking about and what it has to do with Bluetooth - so let&#8217;s take a step back and start at the beginning.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>FireWire transfers data at up to 400 Mbps, which means that it delivers more than 30 times the bandwidth of the popular USB standard. Apple has built FireWire into every computer they sell because they believed it would succeed - and it did. You can now buy a multitude of devices that connect through FireWire such as external harddisks or video Cameras. Apple believed in it, Apple added it, Apple helped make it a standard, and FireWire succeeded.</p>

<p>Digital cameras are all the hype now, with resolutions approaching equal or better quality than that of standard film - an example of another discruptive technology which has succeeded. With OS X, Apple added support for digital cameras from the start, integrating the iPhoto application to get your photos from the camera to your computer easily and putting a good database behind it while they were at it. Apple believed in digital cameras, Apple added support for them, Apple helped make them grow, and digital cameras succeeded.</p>

<p>I have been using a Wireless LAN for several years now and I love it, plain and simple. In Windows, actually, in the not-OS-X world, WLAN is something of an add-on in most the cases. Some laptops on the market now have built in nocat functionality (a name which describes Wireless LAN technology very well). You buy a <a href="http://www.nocat.net/">nocat</a> card and plug it into your laptop, where it ends up sticking out - reminding you that adding it was an afterthought, and that it&#8217;s on top of your computing experience, making it better. Apple believed in nocat, understood what nocat was about, understood the power of nocat, knew it was a standard to use. They also understood that it is part of your computing experience or at least should be - and as a result, they added nocat capabilities to their entire product line: not as an add-on, but as an integrated feature. On my iBook, the Apple Airport card (which is the name for Apple&amp;rsquo;s nocat card) fits neatly under my keyboard, moving out of sight, being part of the experience. The same goes for their iMac, PowerMac or eMac. It fits inside the box, vanishes and just works. As long as I have my network setting set to &quot;Automatic&quot; in OS X, the iBook will automatically find the pre-defined nocat network that I can currently use and - well, use it. By now, people understand that nocat is a success.</p>

<p>This is when one could say Bluetooth comes in. In Jaguar, Bluetooth support is built-in, and all you need is a small USB Bluetooth dongle to get it working. Plug-in, works. As far as rumors go, Apple will integrate Bluetooth in future versions of the product lines. Once I plugged in the dongle in Jaguar, the system told me that there is a new port - a Bluetooth modem port. In the OS X Address Book, I now suddenly have the option to send an SMS or call each number that is in there via my connected Bluetooth-capable mobile phone. Apple believes in bluetooth, Apple added it, Apple helps make it a standard and Bluetooth will succeed.</p>

<p>The same goes for SyncML as well. Apple is currently working on iSync, which will let you sync any Bluetooth and SyncML capable device with the Address Book as well as the soon-to-be-released iCal calendar application. Apple believes in SyncML, Apple added it, Apple helps make it a standard and SyncML will succeed.</p>

<p>Some readers might be quick to point out that Apple also came up Newton, a pioneering handheld that is claimed by many to have been ahead of its time. The Newton was shelved, courtesy of Steve Jobs which didn&#8217;t believe in it - or so it seems, chalking up a loss for Apple in terms of mobile devices. In retrospect, it was a loss making endeavour for Apple, but then again I&#8217;m talking about standards and not hardware. In fact, Apple now seems to believe that mobile phones will take over for handhelds in many regards.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying that Apple is the best company in the world, but what they are at the moment is a company that sees what standards are about and knows how to exploit them. And since the introduction of OS X, the standards they have supported have succeeded. Here&#8217;s too the success of Bluetooth and SyncML. Cheers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just bought my ticket to London for the Open University Residential School in September. It will take place near London from the 20th to the 22nd of September and looks like it will be very interesting. I already have a 60 page report about an ice cream company here that will be used for a case study. But to get back to the flying part. 118 EURs for the two way ticket. I am amazed how cheap this stuff is getting. I mean arround 40 EURs of that is airport taxes. So the real ticket is arround 70 EUR. 35 EUR per one-way. If you then think about how many hundred EURs you would otherwise have spent &#8230; you really have to wonder how much profit they earlier made. And at the same time these airlines are making huge losses. This really makes me wonder.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seems like I will be working at Onvista (http://www.onvista-ag.de) for 6 months (not sure for how long yet) in Business Development for the Portal part (http://www.onvista.de), which is the biggest bank independant portal for financial information in Germany. I just got the confirmation call. The fun thing is that it&#8217;s a startup (traded on the german neuer markt since february 2000) but with the, seemingly, right mix of old economy / new economy management. Lots of freedom for employees but with clear goals. Starting on the 9th of September and really looking forward to it. Ha!</p>

Very cool. &quot;Some people compose songs &#8230; Dr. Rubberfunk de-compose. Now here to write some very nice songs, like this next one.&quot; &lt;/I&gt;

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well. Ringfest in Cologne is once again over and this time was fun too. Again very very full and while I wanted to go on Sunday, I didn&#8217;t want to leave the appartment other than for the pool, which proved to be challenging ;)</p>

<p>I had fun looking at a bit of nice stuff at the RTL stage on saturday (<a href="http://www.rtl.de/musik/759337.html">Video here</a>) but most of the time was spent at the Evian stage. Not because the music was better (mostly charty pop stuff), but because we got backstage passes there, which ment access to 3 double decker busses overlooking the crowd (no trying to find a spot with little people to see the stage ;)) as well as access to well &#8230; backstage, with free drinks. Sadly the massage spots were for other people only. There were Guest passes (ours), V.I.P, Artist, Crew, Production and A.A.A. (Access All Areas). Only A.A.A. (obviously), V.I.P and Artist got a massage. The fun thing was that the V.I.P passes were gold, ours were white and the Crew passes were Silver. Hmmm&#8230; so if bad comes to worse, crew goes, V.I.P. stays? ;)</p>

<p>Here is some stuff from the Eins Live Stage (big radio station) from <a href="http://www.einslive.de/diemusik/diesendungen/popkomm_ringfest/eins_live_buehne__samstag__17._august/index.phtml">Saturday</a> and <a href="http://www.einslive.de/diemusik/diesendungen/popkomm_ringfest/eins_live_buehne__sonntag__18._august/index.phtml">Sunday</a>. Their stage is huge but the place is just too packed and it takes too much time to get in. Somehow I need to find somebody with backstage passes for that one next time. I need to get a press pass that somehow gets me in to <em>everything</em>. Otherwise it is just plain useless ;). Oh, remember, Ringfest is a free thingie with 2.5 million people in cologne last year over the weekend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on infoSync) This time around, in my bi-weekly twaddle on the wireless world out there, I will try to revisit a week long trip to Scrimignano, a tiny village in Italy, comfortably situated between Milano and Genova in the middle of nowhere. A small apartment in this 10 house place on top of a small hill among bigger hills, accessible by a small twisted road where driving yields the constant terror of that other car coming head on from around the corner, was the space called home by myself and two friends for a week. Room is tight and I will come right down to the wireless bit, looking out of the window to the mobile communications tower sitting right next to Montemarzino, another small village, where several days were passed at a pool overlooking the valley and letting the eye wonder farther than imagined by somebody used to smoggy city air.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Let&amp;rsquo;s go right to the bad side of things. GPRS roaming is not what it could be as of yet, as I was not able to use GPRS with my standard T-Mobile Germany subscription in Italy - and using the phone to call some foreign dial-up account was out of the question. For that reason, the next stop was an electronics store in the next big city, Tortona, to get a TIM prepaid card. Why? Well, it seems that TIM has GPRS introduction pricing giving you a GPRS flatrate for 10 EURs for 30 days. A Mobile Phones Geek&amp;rsquo;s images of heaven erupted. Of course, it is far from that easy, mainly because of the language called Italian that has still to be mastered by yours truly. GPRS is not turned on by default and nobody seems to be able to give me the settings I needed.</p>

<p>Thankfully I remembered that most hotlines use 9 or 0 to be connected to a live operator and when I finally managed to get somebody on the line, that person obviously speaks as much English as I do Italian. A stream of words comes across from my end and I seem to have made myself reasonably clear that I need GPRS to be turned on, hoping that this will get me the flat-rate by default. After a short pause on the other end, I am told something with &quot;GPRS&quot; in it, and what my friends and I presume to mean tomorrow. Not even thinking about trying to explain that we need the APN and DNS servers, we take a painful step. We dial up over another phone to holland and connect to the internet with one of the three laptops at our disposal and finally get all the settings we need.</p>

<p>Sadly, it didn&#8217;t seem like &quot;tomorrow&quot; was part of the sentence by the help desk person after all, because GPRS was did not work tomorrow - or any other day, for that matter. As this was after all a holiday, and being cut off from the world out there without any news or e-mail was starting to feel good, we called it quits right there. Someone could have made oodles of money off of us if it was not for the language barrier, and they would have just kept us hooked. Ah well, this is life. Life that is at the brink of having enabled us to do something very much in a geeky nature and actually, something that would have been useful for a lot of people, if GPRS was usable right there from the start. What was it you ask? Let me explain.</p>

<p>We brought with us, among other things, a Nokia 6310 and an Acer USB Bluetooth stick working on an Apple iBook, not yet configured for GPRS (although we would have figured that out in no time if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for the pesky language problems). We also had an Airport card in the iBook and Orinoco Wireless LAN cards in the other two laptops working like a charm. We could have set up the Residential Gateway which would have been amazing fun if it had either bluetooth to connect to the phone or better yet, a GSM/GPRS card included, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t, so we left that one turned off. What we did have though was a full blown 10 Mbps wireless network up and running somewhere in the midst of nowhere, letting us, within our group, even go on top of some mountain or to the pool, being able to work on presentations and other things together. With an antenna that was powerful enough, we might even have been able to connect a few villages, add GPRS flatrate and have entire villages on the Internet in no time. This is the glimpse of the future I&amp;rsquo;m talking about, and it&amp;rsquo;s coming. It will take a bit of time, it will move slowly, it will be started by geeks - but eventually, it will be everywhere.</p>

<p>That future will arrive, of that I&amp;rsquo;m sure - and the only question is when, of which the answer is influenced by ease of use and price. In the end, it will probably change the way we work, play and interact, letting us do so anywhere and at any time. Big words? Well, it might go slower than we&amp;rsquo;d like, but as long as we continue moving, I see a bright future ahead. Oh, the joys of wireless.</p>
