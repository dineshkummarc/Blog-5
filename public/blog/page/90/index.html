It shows how Apple&#8217;s product lines are slowly but surely converging to create a huge opportunity to build on each other. If you take into account that Tom Peters said that in the future we will compete on Design in his latest book Re-Imagine, I can only say that if this is true, then Apple is very well positioned to leverage their design expertise to give people the products they crave, not want, not need, crave. And with the Mac Mini and the iPod Shuffle anyone can now. (<a href="http://apple.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000030027351/">source</a>)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really liked the post from The Big Picture entitled <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2005/01/ipod_shuffle_ne.html">iPod shuffle = new radio ?</a>. Why? Because it is true. The iPod shuffle is the first step in that direction and things like <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> are even going further giving you your music whereever you are. In a sense their profile radio allows you to have a shuffle that includes the new songs that match your music list. Like I would do an Autofill in iTunes including all the file lists I have from other people in my iTunes list through Rendez-vous.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I posted <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/internet_your_l.html">Internet: Your Lego City</a> and it has resulted in some interesting exchanges and I think I need to clarify a few things because as always, I kept a lot hidden in my head without knowing about it. That&#8217;s another thing about writing your own blog that is very important: It helps you clarify your thoughts! In a sense I am trying to publish my embrained knowledge and externalize my tacit knowledge similar to <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/2005/01/managing_knowle.html">Nonaka and Takeuchi&#8217;s SECI model</a>. So bare with me for a few more thoughts.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>First of all, as Thijs noticed in a comment, what I am trying to do is get some new conceptual model built for thinking about internet advertising and how RSS Readers like <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> provide a huge opportunity. They will become my Lego like built Internet City where I live in and marketers will need to try to break into that. I make up my newspaper and potentially my street within this RSS reader, in a lot more powerful way than in eMail. eMail is a communication medium while RSS is just an access medium, enabling communication as one potential additional step.</p>

<p>Another item was that the article seemed to indicate that I think CPM is the right way to place advertisements on the internet and I have to say that this is far from the case. I am a true believer in performance driven advertisement, thinking that Google&#8217;s AdWords is not going far enough to integrate the value chain involved, especially for micromarketing in the long tail. For anyone to advertise via a syndicator on a large quantity of blogs, with uncontrollable content, they need to move the accountability further to the syndicator away from themselves. If you go as far as live time value models, you do not anymore need to worry too much about where your ad runs. If I pay for a placement, then I want to know where that placement is, because I am paying for the control among other things.</p>

<p>Once I go to the performance marketing side, a big company will need to understand that they are relinquishing control in favor of moving accountability to the web site or syndicator. In performance advertising the ads need to be where their performance is best, but they also need to be context unsensitive because this would make placements scare. A lot of people might want to try driving a BMW independent of whether they are just reading an article about the brand or cars in general. If I have subscribed to an RSS feed for cars auctions, I am surely open for ads about cars when reading about the latest news about Apple.</p>

<p>This does not remove the need though for a web site to measure their ads on a CPM basis. If I look to optimize my placements on a web site I will do that in a CPM manner. Google does that with AdSense through their CTR*CPC calculation which is nothing else than a CPM. So no matter how I build my performance model, I will need to understand that the web site should always calculate in CPM.</p>

<p>We also need to find a good CPM price (as a calculation from a performance based placement) for web sites and Aggregators. The list provided in the last article provides a good view on what that price might be. At the moment the CPM based prices are just too high for a performance based placement to work, and that means that there is a big intangible value attached to the placement, mostly called branding, but which could also be repeat customers, world-of-mouth enabled through it, and so on.</p>

<p>What we need there is something like Tobin&#8217;s q in economy. The performance value (book value) will diverge from the brand value (market value) of the placement. A high branding property might have a Tobin&#8217;s q of 3, meaning that if I can pay a CPM of â‚¬3 based on performance measures directly attached to it, I should charge â‚¬9 for the placement because that&#8217;s its value.</p>

<p>This obviously needs some more thinking, and especially the (new) last bit about Tobin&#8217;s q is nowhere near thought through or that number anywhere easy to establish. But it would be very cool. If you had the web site that has the connectors, the multipliers, that tell all their friends. Your Tobin&#8217;s q would be higher. The web site owner would decide what their q is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;[Please never mind this, just a little game.] Solarenergie ist eine MÃ¶glichkeit heute in die Umwelt zu investieren und dabei noch eine gute Rendite bei einem Investment zu erzielen. Solarkraft ist nicht einfach nur so eine Energie sondern sollte ganz GrundsÃ¤tzlich Ã¼ber lÃ¤ngere Sicht bei uns bleiben. Sollten Solarenergie irgendwann aufgebraucht sein haben wir ein grÃ¶ÃŸeres Problem als unser Investment und die Umwelt. Aber die Sonne ist als Energiequelle fast UnerschÃ¶pflich.</p>

<p>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Die einzigste Sachen die hierbei wichtig und zu beachten ist, wÃ¤re das Solarenergie sehr stark von der eingesetzen Technik abhÃ¤ngt da sich hier entscheidet wieviel der Sonnenenergie wirklich in nutzbare Energie umgewandelt werden kann und das ist nicht wirklich einfach.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solarenergie Definition&lt;/strong&gt;: Energie die aus der Kraft der Sonne schÃ¶pft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Und wo brauchen wir denn Energie? Im Transport, Herstellung, Heizung, Kochen, KÃ¼hlen, &#8230; das lÃ¤ÃŸt sich an vielen Stellen mit der Kraft der Sonne noch etwas machen. Solar bringt Kraft!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formen der Solarenergie:&lt;/strong&gt; Hier kann es darum gehen Brauchwasser zum heizen aufzuwÃ¤rmen oder mit hilfe der Photovoltaik die Sonne zur Stromerzeugung zu nutzen. Hierbei ist der Wirkungsgrad der wandelnden Zellen sehr wichtig. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Das ganze &lt;strong&gt;Thema Solarenergie&lt;/strong&gt; wird sich noch stark weiterentwickeln und dies ist auch der Grund weshalb ein Investment in Solarenergie sich wirklich lohnen kann. Auch wenn das ganze hier eigentlich eine Art Wette mit einem Freund ist, kann man sich natÃ¼rlich auch fÃ¼r das Thema interessieren. Wenn man in den Markt investieren will kann man sich das folgende ansehen: <a href="http://r.dimaso.net/click.html?z=e84W54y3oa7g4le1iXaNLUWPwP89yM9JjAofmR4%2FW7WBSeW%2FBDW7TnG0vFyas9ByfMeUXfn6ka83">8,5% Zinsen mit der Solarenergie Euro Anleihe</a> .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;I just took a look at the Apple shop and saw the Bestsellers on the right. Interesting to look at:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

&lt;li&gt;Altec Lansing inMotion iM3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This seems to be the same list in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, &#8230; I presume this List is for Europe then, their European Distribution Hub or something. All in all, in Europe, the Mac mini seems to be selling better than the iPod at the moment, at least as the best mac only beaten by the iPod mini. To be expected but still interesting to see.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;&#8230; or the story of RSS readers and their future. Follow me for some thoughts that I needed to get out of my head about the internet, main shopping streets, CPM prices, daily news, RSS, RSS Readers, and some ideas about where all of this is leading us.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>The internet is more like the world than anything else. Your virtual world in the widest sense and within it you build your own city, your own main street, the places you go to and visit and hang out at. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;If you now free your mind and start thinking along those lines, a lot of things are moved to a different light and a lot of opportunities start to materialize as you are looking at analogies and different mental models to describe that world.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Looking out of the window driving through Cologne, where I live, I see fairly little advertisements if I don&#8217;t pay too much attention to them. They are next to big intersections, next to my way to where I want to be going and they don&#8217;t really cost that much to put it or disturb me. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I recently found a study of CPM prices in germany and here is what it listed:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cinema: 78,25â‚¬&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internet: 19,15â‚¬&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily Paper: 10,72â‚¬&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magazine: 8,90â‚¬&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radio: 6,68â‚¬&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TV: 6,58â‚¬&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posters: 5,70â‚¬&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gasoline pumps (yes that&#8217;s possible ;)): 4,50â‚¬&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I bow my head to the cinema. Of course, I can&#8217;t switch the channel there and it is BIG, getting my full attention. Daily papers just have huge volumes and radio is often listened to in a way that you don&#8217;t switch around the channels either. For TV it is different, because I switch of the ads more often. Posters, the thing you see in the city, are cheapest and Internet advertising is really expensive in relation to the others! And it annoys me a lot of times and as often argued doesn&#8217;t really carry branding messages too well. Oh boy.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;But back to the city. When walking around in Cologne I see shops, coffee places, restaurants, museums, hotels, houses where people live in and more. Prime locations in the city are expensive but shops know that if they put themselves up on the main street that they get the crowd and the branding and the sales. The people renting the places clearly know what the place is worth and put the rent up higher in main street. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Still this rent can be seen like a minimum revenue share for the owner of that building as seen from the eyes of the shop owner. If I know my rent will be less than let&#8217;s say 10% (and I have no clue!) of the revenue I have, the potential to turn a profit is good. It&#8217;s only a quasi revenue share because the house owner doesn&#8217;t really want to carry the risk.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Smaller shop owners or those that don&#8217;t sell something that a lot of people want, cannot run the risk to rent in the high cost places and will likely go to the back streets. You can&#8217;t have a streets with only specialists. The smaller shop owners will be found by word-of-mouth, a search in the yellow pages for specialists, people wandering around or by maybe a small flyer on the main street.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever gone through one of your main streets though with 6 buildings around you and two of them having nothing but a huge advertisement? I don&#8217;t think so. It might be a wonderful branding opportunity to put that up there in christmas week in main street but buy would it be expensive! You would need to rent the entire house. People can only do that with houses that are currently being built and can&#8217;t be used as rentable property yet.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;On some websites it is even worse. We put big posters up on half the houses in our streets that wouldn&#8217;t be rentable for that money as they wouldn&#8217;t be profitable and we even wrote pop-up-people that hammer an ad against our faces right in the middle of the street, out of nowhere, unannounced. Nobody would even think about doing that in the main shopping street.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In a sense you can see the street with the houses as a big website or even an aggregation of websites. These sites can then put shops up or allow others to put shops up, charging a fixed fee, or a few per 1000 people walking by (CPM). The &quot;1000 people walking by&quot; thing just isn&#8217;t possible to do in real life. But even with the possibility to charge like magazines charge, per 1000 users, web sites cannot charge more than a fair revenue share, be it CPM based on in a real revenue share. They might make more in revenue share but as house owners, they want more control in their business. CPM is just the better thing for websites as it is more controllable. The only way a CPM booking can then go higher than a fair revenue share, is if there is some real branding value attached, but you might also argue that like on the street, this will not be justifiable in cost. The revenue share is already higher than what a good branding price would be. As I said, otherwise we would see building on main street with nothing but a big post on them.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Newspapers are something else, as they are really charging for branding, but they come to me, potentially different ones and the paper aggregates the right content for me. I choose which paper to read based on the transactions costs involved, meaning that I won&#8217;t read too many. On the internet the transaction costs are a lot lower, and at this time I go to the content in most cases. I am really one the move, not sitting back and relaxing. There is hence a big different between a newspaper and the internet, or the city as such. It is more of a city and with less transaction costs and the possibility to assemble my city.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Now it gets interesting (finally). Blogs and RSS enable a new phenomenon that puts the user back in control, bringing micro-content to them based on their choosing, meaning the user wins, something favored by our wonderful economy. People set up shops anywhere now and I get to know about them by friends and family and can connect them to my street through RSS, creating my Lego City. People and the big shop owners might be on my street or not and if they are, they can offer shelf space for other corporations, making some money.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The cool thing is that my street (or paper) ends up being a prime suspect for highly targeted advertisement, which doesn&#8217;t even have to be contextual. Advertisement has always been about getting me interested in something I didn&#8217;t know I was interested in. The readers can target based on categories of things I subscribe to, to the makeup of my street, going a lot deeper than simply contextual advertisement. It is highly targeted because the places I have aggregated cater to a very specific audience and if I chose the coffee house that is hip with designers, they will easily be able to add some Designer wares to their shelf. This is really a push back to niche sites.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;And this is where it becomes scary as my Internet City, my Lego City will be my RSS Reader! It is not only my street, but also my daily newspaper. I got there to find out the latest happenings, in my street, through the street paper. As on a street, or a paper though, it is not the coffee shop full of designers that puts the ads there, but the street construction company. They get something like 4â‚¬ CPM for their ads but I am in the street a lot. They might even get CPM values around 10â‚¬ because my RSS reader is like my daily paper too! (Update: The price in CPM is just re calculated. Most of this would be performance based up to life-time-value placements, but that is another story. For a website, you measure in CPM in the end.) The ads are unobtrusive though and a lot more targeted than the ones in the standard street or the daily paper, as it&#8217;s my street, my paper. I hang out there a lot more often too. I suspect that paper ads still have a higher brand value because they are consumed in a more relaxed state and the ads take up more real estate, but I am in a less searching mode than in the city, so I presume the right price would be somewhere in the middle for small unobtrusive brand advertisement. Then of course there will be a lot of different new ideas that emerge to targets different messages on that interactive moving street.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;It goes even further though, as in case I saw something some time ago in my street, I will search my RSS reader. When I get up in the morning I will check what&#8217;s happening in my street and things not there will become my back streets. I still get there, but only occasionally when I am somehow lured there. The shops, or RSS feeds if you are starting to be annoyed of all this real world talk, will try to get me in their shops. The RSS feeds will be the store front.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This means that the idea that the RSS reader is the new browser is really not taking it far enough, because the browser just allows me to see my street. The RSS reader will allow me to make my street, only giving access to shops that give me their storefront via RSS. The reader will be an immense place of power. It can become the epicenter of my world.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: Some more thoughts and clarifications are <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/internet_your_l.html">here</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wanted to have this, do this, for some time already and now Jeremy <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003924.html">posted about</a> Yahoo! Finance having <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rss.html">RSS feed</a> of the news of companies with a ticker symbol. You can just get all the news to the stock that you have or want to have in your portfolio. Now all I want is that they also push out the new price with every news. :)</p>

<p>On a related note, you can also <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/msnsearch/archive/2005/01/11/351064.aspx">get RSS feeds of MSN Search results</a>, both news and web. That will put them one step in front of Google News in some respects, because there I don&#8217;t get RSS feeds.</p>
