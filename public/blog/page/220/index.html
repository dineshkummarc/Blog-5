  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have somebody in my current study group that is working in a company doing medical devices. They are delivering when the customer needs it and I mean that literaly. It happens, though rarely, that a physician calls from the operating room and says that they need some little item in a specific size and then somebody will jump in a car or even use a helicopter to deliver that.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I gave up. I wanted to get a Cable modem (2mbit up and down!) but they are still a long way from making it available at my place so with the help of a friend who works at my telephone provider I will have DSL on the 15th of next month (instead of the 14 weeks waiting period).</p>

<p>The only problem I saw was that my Wireless LAN Gateway can&#8217;t really do DSL so I thought I&#8217;d need to use my laptop, which has a broken screen anyway, as a server.</p>

<p>When I got the DSL Modem from Net-Cologne (the telephone company) today it included a special user guide done by Net-Cologne themselves. The ADSL modem itself didn&#8217;t include any documentation. How weird. Then I wondered. They only want you to connect one PC to the modem, everything else would be against their rules. But hey, who cares for rules. I started looking and found the documentation.</p>

<p>A wonderful device. I can access it via telnet and a browser, set up the DSL config, username and password, if it should stay connected or cut the connection after a given time, DNS forwarding, DHCP if I want and even a simple firewall based on IP addresses that are allowed to connect. Who would have thought that they give me such wonderful hardware for free ;)</p>

<p>All my worries are settled now and everything will work just fine. When I told my friend he was more than a bit surprised what the device can do. He&#8217;s not that technical but wouldn&#8217;t have thought that Net-Cologne does something like that anyway.</p>

<p>The only problem I still see is if the device is possibly configured to not give access to the management console. But I will see about that later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on infoSync) First of all, we need to take a look at how all this IP mumbo jumbo really works - or the basics of it, at least. IP stands for Internet Protocol, and the interesting part for us is the general routing of data packets it&#8217;s responsible for. When I send you a direct instant message (e.g. ICQ) from my computer, this message is instantly split up into several data packets which are numbered, and sent via my network card (or modem) into the network I&#8217;m connected to. Just for argument&#8217;s sake, we&#8217;ll now presume you are sitting far far away in another country.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>What happens next is that my packet gets sent to my so-called default gateway, whose address was provided to me (automatically) by my network provider. That computer looks in its routing table to see where to send all the packets, and then does just that. Each and every one of those packets include your address, and suddenly - the packet arrives somewhere where a router/switch knows roughly where that address is located, and all the packets are sent in that direction. Then, another one of these boxes responsible for routing the packets knows the exact network that your computer is in, sends the packets there for your computer to get them. Finally, the packets are put back together and the message pops up on your screen - and everyone&#8217;s happy.</p>

<p>Now, lets change that scenario slightly. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re dialed in via your W-CDMA capable laptop, sitting on a train from Cologne (Germany) to Brussels (Belgium). When you entered the train and sat down, you initiated your network connection - and right now, among other things, you have established a secure connection to a web based conferencing system, are online with multiple instant messaging services, and have initiated a gaming session on Everquest. You&#8217;re a busy guy, or girl for that matter.</p>

<p>Under closer scrutiny, it suddenly becomes clear that many or all of these applications need a continuous connection to the network. Some probably save your current IP address as part of their methods of keeping track of you, and start complaining once that address changes.</p>

<p>Our second look, which is what will bring you the a-ha experience, goes to what part your mobile phone plays. While you are moving along, your phone keeps up a connection to at least one WCDMA base station, and when you&#8217;ve strayed too far changes to another base station that&#8217;s closer by - which is where the problem arises. It might well be that the traffic sent and received from your second base station is routed totally different than from your first one, possibly because your carrier has different backbone systems throughout the country. If you move over the border, you suddenly find yourself connected to one of the carriers that your carrier has a roaming agreement with, so at the very latest things will really change at this point (different carrier, different network, different backbone, different country, different whateveryoucanthinkof).</p>

<p>Right about here is where everything suddenly becomes a major pain in the emm&#8230; butt, because if they want to keep up your connection, then you will absolutely have to use the same IP address the entire time. The problem is that if packets are sent back to your IP address, then under normal circumstances they would end up at your first base station. You are not connected to that one anymore though, are you? This is exactly where MobileIP comes in. The idea is to have a system in place that will let you carry your IP address along wherever you go while you stay connected.</p>

<p>To learn more on how this works, and to be sure to not say anything that is completely rubbish, I got in touch with an engineer at Nokia who also has a bunch of people sitting around him which have written some of the RFCs (Request for Comment), used in the development of several of today&#8217;s Internet standards in relation to MobileIP. If there&#8217;s anyone who could provide me with the right answers, he certainly qualifies. He was kind enough to answer some questions for me, and here are the answers straight from the horses&#8217; mouth.</p>

<p>Oliver: Could you please first introduce yourself and tell us a bit about what you do at Nokia?</p>

<p>T.J. Kniveton: Sure, Oliver. My name is T.J. Kniveton, and I am a senior research engineer at Nokia in Mountain View, California. We have a small research group here filled with creative experts who are focused on forming new mobility technologies related to Mobile IPv6.</p>

<p>Oliver: The IETF Mobile IP Working Group seems to be behind all this. How many people or companies are those? Will it be a world wide standard to attack the discussed problem?</p>

<p>T.J. Kniveton: The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is a unique organization, which is composed of a very diverse set of people. It is engineering-driven, and made up of a number of focus areas like Security, Routing, and Applications, with many individual working groups (WGs) tackling specific issues. There is no membership criterion to the IETF, per se. Any interested individual can post messages on WG mailing lists or show up at one of the meetings and contribute their engineering ideas to improving the future of the Internet. In this sense, it&#8217;s very democratic.</p>

<p>Within the IETF, mobility has received a lot of attention lately. The Mobile IP WG meetings are filled with hundreds of people from companies and universities all over the world. It is very representative of the organizations that make up the Internet itself, and the ideas are so diverse and plentiful that it may be challenging for the WG chairs to incorporate everyone&#8217;s ideas.</p>

<p>The Mobile IP WG has a number of drafts and RFCs which make up the core of its work. These are loosely organized around Mobile IPv4, and Mobile IPv6, which are two standards for enabling mobility in the way you described above. There are dozens of related drafts that describe optimizations and extensions to these protocols for enabling all different types of scenarios.</p>

<p>The great thing about the IETF is that instead of just writing specifications and unleashing them on the world, the engineers that make these recommendations also implement and test their ideas. So before a draft can become an RFC, it has already been tested and interoperability experiments have been done, which gives us more confidence that it is a realistic idea and will work in the real world. The IETF&#8217;s motto is &quot;Rough consensus and running code,&quot; and you would be surprised how much progress can be made on a technology when the top engineers from all sorts of companies, organizations and schools, put their minds together to hammer out a solution to the Internet&#8217;s hardest problems.</p>

<p>Oliver: Can you explain in a bit more detailed way, beyond my simple introduction, how MobileIP works, as of currently?</p>

<p>T.J. Kniveton: Actually, Oliver, I think you did a good job of summing up the basic concepts. Like I said, there are two protocols to consider here, MIPv4 and MIPv6. Just like IPv4, MIPv4 has been around for a while, and is well into the standards track process. MIPv6 is also a mature document, having gone through 15 revisions so far (!) and the WG is in the final stages of working out security issues related to address ownership.</p>

<p>To illustrate the address ownership issue, imagine if you were on your train between Cologne and Brussels, busily ICQing your friends and maybe even having a voice-over-IP call to your special someone. Meanwhile, I am sitting in Helsinki, a bit bored, and decide that I want to steal your active connections. After looking up your IP address, I then send a packet to your correspondents&#8217; computers, telling them that your attachment point to the network (we call it a Care-Of Address), has actually moved to the IP address of my laptop. All of the sudden, your ICQ sessions go dead, and meanwhile I am listening to your girlfriend whisper sweet nothings over the voice chat which I have stolen.</p>

<p>Well, that would obviously be a bad situation, and besides the frustration of losing all the traffic which has been diverted, you would want to avoid getting in hot water for hanging up on your friends. So there has to be a way for you to prove that you really own the IP address that you are registering at all the base stations between Cologne and Brussels. Even if these access points have never heard of your cell phone before, they have to have a way to trust that it&#8217;s really you that&#8217;s moving around. In today&#8217;s fixed Internet, this is not much of a problem - if a packet destined to you shows up on your network, it&#8217;s pretty much assumed that you have the right to receive it.</p>

<p>But when devices start moving around, and bringing their little corner of the Internet with them, things get a bit more complicated, and we have to be sure that you&#8217;re really authorized to carry that address along with you. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been working on lately. Once those last few security issues are solved, the draft will be pretty much ready to release out into the wild!</p>

<p>Perhaps the only other technical comments I would add are simply about terminology, so that your readers will understand the parlance when reading our specifications. In Mobile IP, we call your device (whether it is a laptop, mobile phone, or any other IP-capable communicator) a Mobile Node (MN). The MN has a Home Address (HA), which is the permanent address it uses to communicate with the rest of the world. When the MN roams to a foreign network, it gets a Care-Of Address (CoA), which is a temporary IP address used for sending traffic while at that part of the network. The CoA either comes from a Foreign Agent (in MIPv4), or is assigned through stateless address autoconfiguration (as in MIPv6).</p>

<p>Once the MN has a CoA, it then sends a Binding Update (BU) to its HA and all of the Correspondent Nodes (CNs) it is communicating with, informing them to forward all traffic to the CoA until further notice. At that point, the HA begins intercepting any packets that show up on the home network for the MN&#8217;s home address, and tunneling them to the MN at its current CoA. That&#8217;s it- pretty simple, huh? :-)</p>

<p>Oliver: Are there already any live systems that are running something suggested by the Mobile IP WG? Telia, for example, recently announced that they have GPRS roaming operational, but I presume this has nothing much to do with Mobile IP, which goes beyond that.</p>

<p>T.J. Kniveton: Yes, actually there has been quite a bit of commercial interest in Mobile IP. Some of the companies that have been named on the Mobile IP mailing list as having deployments are Cisco, IPunplugged, Netseal, Birdstep, Nextel, Sprint, Lifix, and this is just a partial list with many more companies involved. We also have a number of commercial projects here at Nokia that are using Mobile IP.</p>

<p>In research labs, there are very many Mobile IP implementations, including our own MIPv6 prototype with many extensions such as Fast Handovers, Smooth Handovers, Buffering, Context Transfer, Regional Registration, and GSM/SIM Authentication. I&#8217;ll let you imagine what all of those things do..</p>

<p>Oliver: If all those mobile devices have their IP address, will IPv4 work at any time or will there be some faked solution on the way to IPv6? This seems to be particularly crucial with things like MMS which requires, as of my current understanding, a fixed IP address to work reliably. (Note: IPv4 is the old IP Address standard that makes X addresses available for use while IPv6 has a pool of Y addresses)</p>

<p>T.J. Kniveton: Wow, this could turn into a whole other interview about IPv6! Well, let&#8217;s just say this: IPv4 addresses are rapidly being used up, and most of them are allocated to the U.S. and Europe. So, there is a lot of interest in the rest of the world for moving to IPv6. For instance, China has only been allocated about 9 million IPv4 addresses, which is a very small amount considering their population. It is clear that IPv4 can not serve everyone indefinitely. Japan has been a real leader in embracing IPv6, and their government is mandating companies to start using IPv6.</p>

<p>We believe that it is important for mobile devices to be reachable on the Internet, in the same way that your phone can be dialed from anywhere in the world from any other phone, simply by punching in your number, and your desktop computer is probably accessible from any other point on the Internet, at least while you are connected. For true global reachability to happen, it really looks like IPv6 is an important technology. The expanded address space of IPv6 allows everyone in the world the opportunity to have abundant addresses for all their mobile (and fixed) devices. There are some other properties of IPv6 that make it really a great evolutionary step past today&#8217;s IPv4 networks. And I guess I should insert a plug here for Nokia, since we have some of the foremost experts in IPv6 on our campuses as well.</p>

<p>Oliver: Mobile IP is supposed to work across media types. Does that mean technologies like UMTS and EDGE, which are supposed to be integrated into one seamless network in the long run anyway, or also GPRS and 802.11b? Does there need to be a relationship between the providers of those services in any case, or not?</p>

<p>T.J. Kniveton: This is a really hot topic right now, and we are looking at it carefully. It is our goal to allow seamless mobility between all different types of access technologies. In the end, that is what&#8217;s going to make the services on these networks most useful. At this very moment, carriers are spending a lot of time thinking about how they can provide all of these access methods in an integrated fashion so that they are straightforward and simple for you, their customer. Without getting into the technical details, I would just say that Mobile IP should prove very important for the model of how the Internet and mobile services will be delivered in the future.</p>

<p>You may not have thought about cell phone companies and providers being very interested in the Internet before. But with the importance of IPv6 in tomorrow&#8217;s mobility landscape, a tremendous amount of pioneering work is happening today in the research labs and product development workshops of the mobile phone vendors and service providers.</p>

<p>Oliver: Nowadays, when I move across a border and my carrier changes, my normal voice calls are dropped. Is that just a problem of today, or will Mobile IP not work across different carriers either?</p>

<p>T.J. Kniveton: Of course it will! :-)</p>

<p>Oliver: Thanks a lot for answering my questions in such detail, T.J. For those of our readers who want to really dig down on Mobile IP I would suggest going <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/mobileip-charter.html">here</a> for a lot of RFCs on different subjects.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;(Originally published on infoSync) I recently read a very good article on .NET at <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=686">OS News</a>, which attempts to filter out most of the hype and focus on what .NET can really do and is about in the long term, even mentioning that Microsoft is doing research on computer architecture where the device you are holding will borrow everything from the server, from RAM, hard disk space to CPU power. This got me thinking about the war currently going on between Microsoft and Nokia - which, if you take a closer look, will see is a real battle.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So what is going on?</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>MS has recently announced a deal with Texas Instruments to bring a reference platform to the market, which companies can use to build mobile phones based on SmartPhone 2002, previously named Stinger, Microsoft&#8217;s mobile phone platform. Microsoft also announced the Phone Edition of its Pocket PC 2002 platform, which offers current Pocket PC manufacturers an easier path for adding mobile phone capabilities to their devices - and new manufacturers a more interesting platform. If you take into account the fact that .NET will make it totally unimportant with which device you connect to any of the applications/services that .NET will make available, Microsoft&#8217;s grand scheme will become obvious. Microsoft already has what some might call a monopoly on the desktop and will use that to push .NET through other channels. Microsoft wants to be everywhere, which is the true reason for why .NET was devised. Once you have .NET on your desktop you might want to use it on your PDA (done), your XBox (done), your set-top box (done) or your phone (done). See it now? MS is thinking big, and with that strategy will be very well placed to exploit the company&#8217;s leadership in other fields to enhance the value of their mobile phone and PDA platforms too.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft succeeds, the company will be able to once again control the API that developers work with. They will make the developers accustomed to that API, provide them with very good development tools, and thus make it hard for them to develop for another platform, locking them in on the platform. The benefits for consumers would be that Microsoft is moving in a similar direction with regard to its mobile phone and PDA platforms as it has in the past with desktops; making the hardware underneath a commodity, and helping to create the next Dell - and you can be sure Dell will enter the market if the company can get even the tiniest profit out of it. My point is that users will find the same interaction method, the same graphical user interface, on all devices and can easily switch between devices from different manufacturers without having to learn how to use a new interface. This is one of the factors that helped the PC business to become so successful, and in return granted consumers with (relatively) cheap access to computers.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;And this is where Nokia comes in. Nokia does for sure not want mobile phones to become commodities, which would drive down prices and cut away at their margins. Nokia is at this time one of the few mobile phone companies that make a profit on its phones. Of course, mobile phones will not become commodities if Nokia gets their say - and many believe them. Nokia&#8217;s argument is that in relation to PCs, mobile phones are with you at all times and are very personal devices. You can walk in to many Internet Caf&amp;eacute;s and use the computers there, or work in a computer pool at an educational institution, or use the company computers. But you will have your own mobile phone with you at all times, and it will be an extension to your personality. Just take into account the amazing popularity of ring tones and phone covers.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Even though the personality of mobile phones is a likely presumption, Nokia still needs to make sure that it has a good bit of control over the market and distinctions therein. Upon close scrutiny, you will see that Nokia is also trying to control the API, apparent in their move similar to Microsoft&#8217;s to provide companies with a reference design for mobile phones based on Nokia&amp;rsquo;s Series 60 platform (Symbian based) together with a partnership with - you guessed it - Texas Instruments. Provided Nokia can push companies to use their reference design instead of Microsoft&#8217;s SmartPhone 2002 platform, they will have the power over the API to which developers code their applications (in C++ for native Symbian apps or Java which is increasingly available in mobile phones), and the users will be accustomed to use that interface, even though it is far more customizable than that of SmartPhone 2002. Controlling the API is crucial in the long run, but for Nokia, the other crucial part is that you can customize the interface and create something special. It&#8217;s important to remember that Nokia is working hard to elevate itself to the status of &quot;platform company&quot;, as Jorma Ollila, Nokia&#8217;s CEO, put it in a speech at last year&amp;rsquo;s Comdex in Las Vegas saying that Nokia has &quot;commitment to open mobile architecture enabling a non- fragmented global mobile wireless market,&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Nokia is also trying to work against MS by being one of the companies behind the Liberty Alliance (started by Sun), which wants to establish another authorization method than the one used by .NET (based on Passport). More on this can be read in the article on OS News but in short, the idea in both is that you will have one login and password for logging in to numerous different services such as your e-mail, calendar, tasks list, word application, knowledge database, tax application, shopping - you name it. You will also only pay for what you use and how long, while billing will be handled by the service. The Liberty Alliance is paying close attention to privacy so that users will only make their personal information available to those companies that they want to. Many people grow concerned when thinking of Microsoft handling all of their logins and monetary transactions on the web, but Microsoft will obviously address these concerns once the service is launched.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The solution of the Liberty Alliance is Java-based, and J2ME (Java 2 Micro Edition) is already becoming a standard in mobile phones for developing applications for them. A uniform view is that this one-login-for-everything approach to authentication will be crucial in the future, hence the powerful movement behind the efforts. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This brings up the question of which platform is more important to dominate in the future: desktop PCs or mobile hones? Arguably, there are more mobile phones out there than PCs, but the dominance of Microsoft is larger on the desktop PC than Nokia&#8217;s is in terms of mobile phones. Meanwhile, the Liberty Alliance enjoys far more backing in terms of companies supporting the alliance than the Microsoft alternative, mainly because by now, many companies and especially mobile phone companies do not want to be at the mercy of Microsoft at this time if they can somehow avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A point to remember is that both the .NET and the Liberty Alliance approach build on SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) for the interaction of the services. Thus, an interesting aspect of the race will be whether service providers of various kinds will allow not only one, but both authentication systems (.NET, and Liberty Alliance) to interact with their services. If this becomes the case, you will be able to use a SOAP based service via logging in to MS&amp;rsquo;s platform or the Liberty Alliance system. As an example, there might be a company that provides a very good text editor that you can use whenever you please, and pay as you go, whilst another company is making advanced translation services available. If one service requires the authentication to be performed by .NET, and the other service by the Liberty Alliance, you would not be able to use both services simultaneously - but if both services would allow both authentication methods, you could do your word processing through one service and let it be translated in the other service independent of which authentication system you use. That means that if there is a drive towards making the services independent of the authentication system, then there would be less drive to use any one of them exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;All in all, the race is still on, and many already believe that it will just be a space divided evenly between Microsoft and the Liberty Alliance. Only time will tell, and the judge is still out as to which one would be the better solution.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(translated from german)</p>

<p>A professor of medicine is holding a lecture for his first year students to introduce them to medicine.</p>

<p>&quot;We will start with the basics of Autopsy. Two things are very important.</p>

<p>First: You have to overcome disgust. Look here &#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>And he puts a finger into the ass of a dead man on the table, pulls out the finger puts it in his mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;And now you, one after the other!&quot;</p>

<p>With white faces each of the students go past the body. Once they are done the professor continues.</p>

<p>&quot;And second you need to sharpen your observation skills. I put the index finger in the man&#8217;s ass and put my middle finger in my mouth.&quot;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, it seems that my first year at the OU is done and if nothing went amazingly wrong then I should have my Certificate in Management in my pocket. Feels good. I wrote the test in Frankfurt yesterday which was a very interesting day anyway.</p>

<p>It started the night before when I read that <a href="http://www.fool.com/">TMF</a> will start charging for their discussion boards. Roughly $30 per year. They will remove the ads and add several new features as well as develop new ones on request. I was wondering about weather I should do it or not but then decided to pay for it as I really met wonderful people and learned a great deal on the boards. And for what I have gotten out, $30 is nothing. But then, a mail arrived. :)</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;Congratulations! You have been awarded a free one-year subscription to the Fool Community &#8211; no strings attached.[&#8230;]
This is our way of thanking you for being a valued contributor to the Fool Community in the past. &lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Well that&#8217;s settled then. I will stay. The discussion is going on like crazy with the &quot;Improve the Fool&quot; board alone getting over 500 posts since yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Then I got up early yesterday and started my trip to Frankfurt. The trip was nice, filled with reading and trying to talk with a turkish guy to explain to him that the train will be late and that yes it is going to Frankfurt. He also told me something but I had no clue whatsoever what he was saying :)</p>

<p>I found the location of the test relatively fast but had over 1 hour to kill so I went into a small coffee shop and soon started talking to an elderly woman who was telling me everything about her studies (International Politics something) and that she got an electronic parking card now and is very proud of that. She told me everything about her choice of dress and he talks with the person from the university giving out the permits which did not seem to be easy mostly because he wanted to first give parking places to younger students. Weird. She also asked me dead about what I was studying and in retrospect I have to thank her a lot. First of all she gave me her luck for the day ;) But the bigger thing was that I explained to her what I am studying in a few examples and one of those was the gaps model of meeting customer expectations, or not meeting them. This was one of the questions in the test later on. It was really nice being distracted by her for the last hour and not going through all the papers again.</p>

<p>The test went very well but I am a bit worried that I wrote too much again. We will see, in two months when the grades come back.</p>

<p>I then met Marcus, whom I haven&#8217;t seen in a long time, and had a wonderful time talking about a million things and eating at an american sports bar. It&#8217;s amazing how much he can eat, really amazing. I still can&#8217;t get it into my head.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting things was probably sitting in the train and somehow starting off a very good conversation with somebody next to me and we talked for the entire train ride. He is Product Innovation Manager at Creon Lab Control. What a nice titel :) After talking over what I do, what I would like to do in the future, what he does, what the company does, neural networks, finding parts of molecules in huge test samples, aibo, computer gaming, artificial inteligence, &#8230; wonderful talk really. It has been amazing. He told me to come over some time to the company to take a closer look and I might just do that because it sounded very interesting.</p>

<p>So in short, read a lot of great things, finished a year of studies, wrote a good test, met an old friend, met two interesting people and found a new cool company to possibly work at. Wonderful day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I still believe that the biggest single thing speaking for 3G is the need for more capacity, the general usefulness and features that people want to use are still of interest to many, including me. What will people really want to use?</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nokia.com/">Nokia</a> recently released a <a href="http://presseloft.nokia.de/special/entertainment_1312.pdf">research report</a> (link in German) that Nokia Networks conducted together with the HPI Research Group. In the report, they interviewed people or groups of people from different countries to see what these people really want to be using in the future. Keeping in mind that this is a Nokia report and that the video shown to these people to make them aware of what is possible, as well as the questions, might be a bit biased, it still shows that there is an interest there - which needs to be nurtured. What I just said regarding bias is not meant in a negative way but rather to point out that Nokia will obviously try to learn as best they can whether they are going in the right direction and what they should do in the future, hence a bias towards Nokia.</p>

<p>One thing that needs to be said at the start is that Nokia looked specifically at the core target for 3G offerings, including teenagers as well as young and family adults, as Nokia themselves put it. These groups are currently using mobile phones for personal purposes and are between 16 and 45 years old. 83% of the people surveyed believe technology makes life easier, 78% think the Internet and other devices are fun, while 76% are interested in new developments. Who would have thought.</p>

<p>One thing that clearly stands out in my mind, and not only so because it does in the graph in Nokia&#8217;s paper, is that 65% found the pace of change exciting. At the same time, the media is going on and on about how slowly the implementation of 3G is taking place - the financial press particularly so. I would judge that as a sign that people feel comfortable with the pace of change and don&#8217;t want things to move a lot faster. Some of us would of course like it (all who want cheap wireless broadband connectivity for their phones raise their hands), but the general public doesn&#8217;t want to get a new phone every month.</p>

<p>In light of a recent column of mine titled &quot;I can do that?&quot;, I have to put an emphasis on my belief that the group used in the study is not representative. 86% know about SMS messages and 77% use it, which I find to be a lot. Even more, 83%, use the phone book. This is probably a telltale sign of the younger generation that has been surveyed for the research report, since when talking with older or less technology savvy people, I&#8217;ve noticed that very few of them use any of those features, and some don&#8217;t even use the phone book. Supporting my argument though, is that redirecting calls, call waiting, diary, calculator and games are used by less than 50% throughout the focus group. In short, Nokia has been talking to a technology savvy crowd.</p>

<p>If you look at the differences in how people from different countries respond when asked about their interest in new developments in the mobile phone arena, it&#8217;ll bring a smile to your face when you see that while 71% of Brazilian participants are very excited, only 26% of the UK participants, the homeland of Vodafone, are. As always, Germans are very wary of change, and while the participants are sure that new developments will change things a lot, Germany is in the back of the field when thinking that it will change things for the better. We Germans always assume the worse. :)</p>

<p>But who will buy these new phones or devices when they are out? 16% of the target audience want to have the first model that comes out, and 43% want one of these devices - though not the first one. This is a actually a large group of people that are sure that they want a 3G device. But will they pay for it? Actually, it seems as if the answer is yes, and I found it quite surprising when I read that 9% will pay a lot more for these mobile phones and a total of 60% will pay more.</p>

<p>This probably makes mobile phone manufacturers very happy as they will do their best to keep mobile phone prices up as high as they can. In general though, this sheds a positive light on the 3G market for the future.</p>

<p>So then, what will people want to do with these phones? Nokia asked the audience to name the features they would like to have available. To no surprise, SMS tops the list with 81%, some probably thinking rightfully so that this is a must have anyway. The list goes on with the use of Traffic/Weather Info (71%), Using a Camera (71%), Getting the latest headlines (67%), Sending photos to friends (64%), Video camera (63%), getting info on and booking movie and other kinds of tickets (both 62%) and lastly listening to the radio (60%).</p>

<p>After I looked through that list I found myself puzzled again. So, 59% would want to have a 3G device, even though maybe not the first one, but still over 60% want services from them that are available today on WAP phones - and have been available for some time now, far beyond the first poor implementations. I can easily check out the schedule at the nearest movie theatre, as well as news and weather info, and my mobile already helped me find a way around a traffic jam as well as told me the way to drive to reach a specific destination on several occasions.</p>

<p>The results for the rest of the features might be partly influenced by what kind of products Nokia already has or will have in its line-up. Nokia now includes radios in many models, and the reason for that is probably partly reflected in this research report. On top of that, adding a radio is fairly cheap and easy in mobile phones - not that it has anything to do with 3G as such, but it drives the multimedia paradigm. Using a camera and sending pictures is a really interesting feature though, and shows the way toward the Nokia 7650 as well as MMS. I personally would have put this high up there myself. Just imagine if you can easily - emphasis on easily - send pictures to your friends from wherever you are.</p>

<p>Judging from the report, it will probably be the simple things that will drive traffic for carriers, like more extensive WAP/Services usage and sending and receiving of pictures. Full motion video conferencing on your mobile phone might be interesting, but not everyone are willing to spend the huge amounts of money necessary to use that feature. All this will be driven forward in small steps with more and more multimedia capabilities being added to phones and people using those features once the prices to use them become attractive. This will drive new features to phones slowly, with a focus onfeatures that can be added without adding too much cost to the device as well as a focus on services that are not very bandwidth intensive since bandwidth, as always, costs money.</p>

<p>What this again proves is that both the handset makers and the carriers will have to move with full force towards showing users the ropes and how to use all these features in their phones. On top of that, I believe GPRS services prices will have to drop for people to start using GPRS intensively, although this might require more network capacity to be added first. In general, however, I also believe network operators need to remember that they can&#8217;t put the unused bandwidth they have in some inventory and sell it later. If unused, the bandwidth is lost and with it operators loose a prime opportunity to engage the customer and make us use it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just finished Life Is So Good by George Dawson and Richard Glaubman. George Dawson is now 102 and learned to read at the age of 98. He now lived in 3 centuries and the book is full of amazing stories. His grand parents were slaves and he worked hard all his life.</p>

<p>There are lots of interesting stories in there like a friend of him being hanged because a white girl thought it was safer to say she was raped by a black man than admitting to having sex with a white guy before marriage and being pragnant from him. Nobody said anything when the child was white. Dawson traveling up to Canada and Mexico, wondering why there are no drinking fountains for black people and never fully knowing what to make of the fact that white and black people just ate together in the same restaurant. Paying railway tickets whenever he could but also riding the rails by jumping on a train and almost getting shot one time. Working on building dams for years without a brake and still paying double for a mule because the owner was sick and old and he thought it was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>The emphasis is really strongly on the fact that there is no poor work, just work poorly paid and poorly done. A great book with lots of perspectives that shows you how good you are off and how humble you can be in the worst of times.</p>

<p>He now fills the class room learning to read because other people who were a lot younger said that if he can do it at his age then they can too.</p>

<p>Great book to read I can only suggest.</p>
