  <div class="entry-content"><p>No food for now. I just wanted to buy a pizza at Aldi (local cheap super market) but descided to go later. I was in the shop but forgot that today is once again the day when Aldi sells a PC. These PCs are very good and very cheap. You are feeling as if you were in a war zone with the entire shop full of people. 256MB ram, 2Ghz Intel CPU, 80GB, DVD, CD-RW, Gefore4, Firewire, &#8230; 1200 EUR. It&#8217;s packed. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Stuff is starting to get done. I just downloaded a driver so that my Archos Jukebox will now mount and I am currently transferring my MP3s over to the iBook which might take some time ;)</p>

<p>DragThing seems to be nice for managing my applications but I need to play with it a bit more. If I go to the top left edge it pops up to the front now which is nice enough. Right top is screensaver on, right bottom for it to stay off. DSL is working, local network to my desktop is working, Airport card still missing.</p>

<p>Entourage is a great mail client and I would love to have Outlook do the same things.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be trying out Mozilla a bit as it does not seem to be that slow and the tabbed view is nice. I still need to download Opera though and hope this will be the fastest as I use it on windows too. Sadly some sites just don&#8217;t work in it.</p>

<p>My dock is now really empty only having launched apps in it, due to DragThing and holding CTRL and clicking the apps folder that I put next to the trash will give me something similar to a start menu. I am thinking about putting a few more folders there for more apps which might result in loosing drag thing again. Not sure.</p>

<p>Currently running on Battery since yesterday evening. 50 minutes left. Let&#8217;s see what is done sooner, the iBook or the Jukebox ;)</p>

<p>I love the script menu too, there are some nice things there. I can for example minimize all apps but the finder with two clicks now, could make it one click but I need a special icon for that script first.</p>

<p>I finally decided that I will use iPhoto for my photos too as it is just too nice and I can export HTML sites for it to put them online. Sadly the homepage function only works with the iDisk and these are nicer than the sites it makes otherwise but I will see if I can work around that somehow.</p>

<p>Still some things to settle but it is looking very good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I received my iBook a few hours ago. It is beautiful and I love it. The only problem I have at the moment is that I don&#8217;t have an internet connection. It somehow doesn&#8217;t want to go up to the Wireless Gateway. The airport card is still missing so I have both the desktop and the laptop hocked up to a hub and that one is hooked up to a wireless bridge which again talks to the wireless gateway which is hooked up to the DSL modem. I can ping the  desktop but that&#8217;s it. Very very weird. The desktop can ping the gateway and it gets out. Very weird&#8230; hmm&#8230;</p>

<p>&lt;B&gt;Update&lt;/B&gt;: Now online directly via the DSL modem. Not the best solution but will do for now. I need this damn Airport card :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seems that there are rumors out there that OSX might come to AMD Clawhammer CPUs.</p>

<p>http://www.theinquirer.net/07040202.htm</p>

<p>What I presume though is that Apple would require AMD to make a little tweak in their CPU so that it only runs on the CPUs given to Apple. Now I don&#8217;t know if that is possible but it would sound like an interesting move.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Done. I just found out that my wireless residential gateway (802.11b) does ADSL after all and while there still seem to be some problems (it&#8217;s pinging out and not getting anything back), it is working now. I will have to see if I get that problem settled too but it&#8217;s not that important as it only does that at configuration. Thankfully it held the DSL config even though I had to push cancel on the testing phase. Cables removed from the floor and a BIG pile of cables and boxes at the telephone plug, I am not happy. Avonia will be happy that the cables are out of the room but she will be interested in what all the boxes at the phone plug do now. One for our DECT phones, one for the WaveLAN and one for DSL. The ISDN connector and DSL translator are hidden at least ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Harvard Business Review has an article by Phil Orbanes, who created monopoly, about how game design is similar to management. An exciting idea.</p>

<p>Principle 1
Make the rules simple and unambiguous. An example here would be that &quot;People engage most and their talents flourish best when job responsibilities, business objectives, and evaluation criteria are clearly understood.&quot;</p>

<p>Principle 2
Don&#8217;t frustrate the casual player. If a game should succeed it needs to reach a critical mass which involves a lot of casual players, who have a lot of options in games. In the business sense, what he means here is that in a business there will be people that don&#8217;t want to be executives but there are people at all levels that want to feel like part of a tema and to be able to contribute to the company&#8217;s success.</p>

<p>Priniple 3
Estabilsh a rythm. The best games normally involve 4 people, or at least 3 to 6, because it doesn&#8217;t take too long for each person&#8217;s turn to arrive. Again, in business this translates to everybody wanting their turn too, on rotating assignments for example. You also need a beginning, a middle, and an end which should come with a bang. If you develop a new product the R&amp;D team might be in the endgame while marketing just starts, which makes it hard to them to feel on the same team.</p>

<p>Principle 4
Focus on what&#8217;s happening off the board. This is where the next part comes in, next to structure, which is entertainment, needed for getting people back to the game. What this relates to is that you already need to watch out that your employees relate well to team members and find fulfillment in their jobs. Remember the pyramid of needs? :) Work-life balance is also coming into sight more often.</p>

<p>Principle 5
Give &#8216;em chances to come from behind. You need luck and skill. As a friend of his said: &quot;The reason Monopoly endures is that it&#8217;s 75% skill and 75% luck.&quot;, meaning that you can blame luck if you loose and skill if you win. This can keep a loosing team from giving up and a winning team from resting on its laurels as he puts it.</p>

<p>Principle 6
Provide outlets for latent talents. People would like to have outlets for skills they like to express but can&#8217;t during their normal routines.</p>

<p>Interesting ideas I think.</p>

<p>Your goal: find that elusive query (two words - no quote marks) with a single, solitary result!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished the above book, in my holiday, and I really like it. It&#8217;s not so much a book establishing a conspiracy or really knowing that there is one but what they are doing is giving you an imense background (and several new books for my wishlist while they are at it) about things going on around gods, egypt, aliens and more. I would really like to read &quot;The Keys of Enoch&quot; now but sadly I would have to order it from their web site and I am not really into giving them my name and address ;)</p>

<p>But if you are looking for a good research paper, which is more of what I would say this book is, on things going, or not going on in Egypt, people who said they talked to &quot;The Nine&quot; or other things then go for it. It&#8217;s very good.</p>

<p>&quot;I am the beginning. I am the end. I am the emissary. But the original time that I was on the Planet Earth was 34,000 of your years ago. I am in balance. And when I say &#8216;I&#8217; - I mean because I am an emissary of the Nine. It is not I, but it is the group &#8230; We are nine principles of the Universe, yet together we are one.&quot; - Tom, channeled through Phyllis Schlemmer (The Stargate Conspiracy)</p>

Sadly, it is not 100% sure if I get it yet because it is not in the main distribution center but everything should be fine and it should arrive within a week. Long time, but hey, it will be here :) Woohooo :) 12.1&quot; 600Mhz model if anyone cares to know :) Wohooo&#8230; :)</p>
