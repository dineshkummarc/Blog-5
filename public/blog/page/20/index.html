  <div class="entry-content"><p>First of all, thanks a lot to Hubert Burda and of course to the entire team organizing the event. I had a great time, I was inspired and I will surely come again. The event was a great mix of people leading to very good networking indeed and some very inspirational talks, for example from Brian Cox about the <a href="http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/">Large Hadron Collider</a> at Cern seen here showing us <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/oliver/365697487/">the one formula that explains everything</a> :). And now I am stuck, because there are too many recollections, like <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=-V1RGUsNhfY">waterball at the party</a>, <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=hYt72LX-qnQ">Henning on the Segway</a>, loads of different people  including old and lots of new faces, a great panel on How to be Good, Where are the Editors, The Billion Dollar Bubble (with Marissa Mayer talking live about the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/01/23/google-forgets-to-renew-googlede-site-goes-down/">problem of the google.de domain from the night before</a>) , and more. I really have to <a href="http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/general/arianna-huffington-rocks.html">agree with Martin that Arianna Huffington rocks</a> and the panel with Tarik Krim from <a href="http://netvibes.com">NetVibes</a>, Craig Newmark from <a href="http://craiglist.com">Craigslist</a> (<a href="http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/general/craigas-politics.html">see Martin&#8217;s video</a>), Jim Spanfeller from Forbes and David Sifry (see his <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dsifry/sets/72157594492892929/">great photos from DLD</a>. He&#8217;s a prime lens freak by the way, which I learned at the party :)) from <a href="http://technorati.com">Technorati</a> was very good indeed. Because mentioning NetVibes, I have to also say that meeting Christoph from <a href="http://pagesflakes.com/">Pageflakes</a> (and finally talking to him a bit longer after having seen him at MediaTech and Le Web :)) as well as a new colleague that will become official on Monday, was great.  But that&#8217;s it from me and it&#8217;s back to working on <a href="http://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a> and writing down all the great feedback we received.</p>

<p>You can watch many of the panels <a href="http://videos.dld-conference.com/">here</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There we go, things are settled, Blu-Ray looses. It <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/archives/2007/01/12/porn_could_tilt_the_hidef_dvd_war.html">seems</a> that the porn industry is supporting the HD DVD standard and Sony seems to have just <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.co.uk/news/news.phtml/6209/7233/porn-blu-ray-dvd-format-war.phtml">denied porn on Blu-Ray</a> DVDs. This was the same thing when Sony denied porn on Betamax and then VHS one. It is surely not the only reason VHS won, but hell, it surely made a difference.</p>

<p>As someone once said, who needs several different angles on the same scene anyway? ;)</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see how this plays out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post goes to <a href="http://www.vivanco.de/">Vivanco</a>. We really like their USB Blackboard <a href="http://195.244.96.172/cgi-bin/vivanco/de_DE/productList.html?catId=113&amp;amp;showItems=1">Keyboard</a> here at <a href="https://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a>, at least for those that are none Mac Users, who have the <a href="http://www.macally.com/spec/usb/input_device/icekey.html">Macally Ice Key</a>. I tried to buy one at Media Markt here in Germany for our latest developer, and sadly they were all out &#8230; but one. Sadly that one had a missing key, and a missing fold-out-leg (for lack of a better word) at the bottom. I brought it in and later mailed Vivanco to ask whether there was an option to get the missing key and leg from them in any way, so we had a working product, because we like it so much.</p>

<p>Today in the mail came a new full keyboard with mouse, directly from Vivanco, no strings attached, or so it seems. This simply rocks! Great service and very fast response time. Vivanco will definitely move up in my choice of products when there is a decision to be made!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.plansphere.com/blog/?p=520">Planblog is reporting</a> that the <a href="http://blog.studivz.net/">StudiVZ Blog</a> has been hacked. While this is not very interesting as such, and can happen, but the story is just too funny. In short, Konstantin Urban from <a href="http://www.holtzbrinck-ventures.com/index.php?de">Holtzbrinck Ventures</a> said in an article that the <a href="http://ccc.de/">Chaos Computer Club</a> has tried to hack StudiVZ and failed. Then CCC hacked (or so it seems) the blog to say this is not the case. As a small counter point, there is somebody that is part of some CCC club that to our knowledge tried to hack StudiVZ and failed, but that is not the same thing at CCC itself. Still, this is small mistake, and can be forgiven, it is still fun.</p>

<p>Also today, I learned that the contract with <a href="http://amazon.de/">Amazon</a> for your shipment only comes into place when the item is shipped, not with the confirmation. Why do I know? Because we just read a confirmation very thoroughly, because this morning, 4 laptops were listed at Amazon.de with prices of roughly 20 EURs instead of their real prices and somebody here managed to grab a 1400 EUR Vaio for 20 EURs. Well 22 something because he needs to pay for shipment ;) He will possibly not get it though, at least Amazon doesn&#8217;t have to send it, due to the rules they have set. I am not sure though if they will not do so, because of PR implications. I will update once we know.</p>

<p>Update: The laptop is being retracted and they are just saying its was an error. Damn good rules for them :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have to admit, the <a href="http://apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> from <a href="http://apple.com/">Apple</a> is an amazing system. But when listening to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Hype Master</a> it is sure to just make you drool. Obviously this is his goal but you will have to try to look through the fog to find out what this phone really does for you. By now, I found some problems with it that are important to keep in mind.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;1. No UMTS&lt;/strong&gt;: Ok people, this is no revolution. I now have a smaller Nokia E70 in my pocket, with UMTS, WiFi, fold-out Keyboard, full eMail client, the works. Doesn&#8217;t possibly look so cool but full featured and fully syncing (also over the air and not only with the Mac) and with a memory card slot that currently holds  2GB. I have a mobile podcast client on there that gets me the newest <a href="http://twit.tv">TWiT</a> whenever it is available. The power in this is UMTS! I have a UMTS flatrate and hence am always online. When I am no the train, or in a pub, or at a conference, UMTS is very good to have and it is way faster than EDGE. EDGE never was really 3G, it&#8217;s just at the edge of being 3G. UMTS is 3G.
&lt;strong&gt;2. No VoIP&lt;/strong&gt;: The Nokia has a VoIP client and there at least seems to be a Skype client in development. I didn&#8217;t hear anything about VoIP in this system. Especially as they are working together with Cingular so closely, with Cingular possibly paying a large part of the fee, I doubt that we will see VoIP anytime soon.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;3. OS X&lt;/strong&gt;: Sure, nice, but as Scot said, where is the SDK? I surely can&#8217;t just move my app over. So make sure to understand this correctly. It is <em>based</em> on OS X. &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/01/10/apple-vps-confirm-no-3rd-party-iphone-apps/">No 3rd Party apps will be possible</a>.
&lt;strong&gt;4. Visual Keypad&lt;/strong&gt;: Amazing, this is exactly what the PC did. This is why we all have touchscreen keyboards and PCs. Because tactile feedback sucks big time. NOT! They needed this because they didn&#8217;t have place for a keyboard. Smartphones have configurable buttons.
&lt;strong&gt;5. Visual Voice Mail&lt;/strong&gt;: This only works with Cingular. The voice mails are on the network, and are navigated via pressing the right keys. They needed to work together with Cingular to make this work and it will not work with any other carrier. So really, this is great, but it is to be seen whether they will make it work at any carrier or if it will always be locked in on the carrier. I for one will not switch from Base at the moment.
&lt;strong&gt;6. Safari&lt;/strong&gt;: Safari is not the best web browser in the world and I do have a pretty decent browser on my Nokia, ok, also based on the Safari engine. And I do have a special Google Maps app and I do have a special GMail client.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;7. IMAP eMail&lt;/strong&gt;: I have IMAP. IMAP is not push like Blackberry!!! Blackberry means you are not always online and for IMAP push you will have to be always online. I will have to take a closer look at what else Yahoo! does but I do doubt it is Blackberry level.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;8. 2 Mega Pixel Camera&lt;/strong&gt;: A well, good, but I do have 3 Mega Pixels and a new Nokia has 5 Mega Pixels. I also didn&#8217;t see video recording or <a href="http://shozu.com/">Shozu</a> to automatically Moblog</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;9. Kill app phone calls&lt;/strong&gt;: Did you watch closely? Did you see where the microphone is? At the bottom. Good. Did you see where the speaker is? At the bottom. WHAT? Do I listen with my chin? So this is a phone you will have to use with headphones.</p>

<p>All in all, still a great device but I am not sure it&#8217;s a phone, which might not be bad.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: See comments for the fact that there is another speaker at the top of the phone it seems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2006/11/13/google-for-your-domain-please/">screaming for an account</a> last year, <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> was kind enough to give me a <a href="http://www.google.com/a/">Google Hosted</a> account to handle our eMail at <a href="https://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a>. We already have an account at <a href="http://fusemail.com/">Fusemail</a> for all those that want/need IMAP but for the large part, all the customer care people for example, <a href="http://gmail.com/">GMail</a> is more than enough for their needs.</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d write a small reviewÂ  for those thinking about getting an account. All in all I am very happy with the current setup.</p>

<p>So what can you do with it? First of all you get your own personal start page, where you can require a set amount of content for users and allow them to add other things. As you get a mail and a calendar system, you can for example allow them to add their calendar to the system, as well as an rss feed from your corporate blog for example. This could be required, allowing people to add other things themselves.</p>

<p>The system to set up new users is very easy, allowing you to upload csv files with lots of users or setting them up one by one. You can also set up additional email addresses and lists. For your email needs this is really most you will need. As a nice thing, the logins will not interfere with your main google login, so you can have your personal gmail account open as well as your corporate gmail account. Once an account is set up you can print a simple one page sheet that gives people the url, their login and a generated password to log in for the first time. And once they are logged in you will have an internal system for send instant messages too.</p>

<p>The calendar is obviously great, and I am starting to use this as my only calendar, simply synchronized to my iCal.</p>

<p>We also have very little spam problems with the system and users are generally very happy to use it. With 50 free accounts it will scale very well for us so if you are looking for a good, secure, fast, and easy to use email service, I&#8217;d definitely request an account. Sure, you won&#8217;t have IMAP, but that is survivable for most people. Once they come out with the mobile GMail app for hosted domains, I will be all settled in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Techcrunch has a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/26/why-yahoos-panama-project-is-important/">good post</a> on why Panama is important, not only to Yahoo!, but to the rest of us. I agree fully with Michael on this is very important to get more competition in the space. For monetizing traffic for big publishers, we competed with Google AdSense at what is now Ligatus and did so very well, based on different methods and a slightly different idea. Now with <a href="https://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a> we are actually banking on a different methodology again, also simply exploiting the multitude of networks that are out there. If you are working on a clicks based system, you need to be huge to compete and I am gladly letting that be handled by the likes of Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft. But still, with this system, a lot of advertisers are left out in the cold, and I don&#8217;t think Google&#8217;s move to <a href="http://adwords.blogspot.com/2006/12/advertise-online-even-if-you-dont-have.html">give companies a free web site to advertise on AdWords</a>, will be a real change in this. There are just a lot of people out there who shouldn&#8217;t have to care about AdWords, conversion, optimization, multivariant testing, and the like.</p>

<p>All in all, this will be a good year for Yahoo! on the search/clicks marketing front and while I am not sure choosing ad rank based on CTR and Click Price increases the click price itself, it sure as hell increases the CPM, which is what sites really care about. The problem comes in with those networks going for the agencies and the big companies, and then the big publishers suddenly don&#8217;t want to play that game anymore, because the would rather talk to those companies directly, and get a lot more money out of them. It will be an interesting 2007. Let&#8217;s all have fun.</p>
