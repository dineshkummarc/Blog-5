  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are two outlooks here, the long-term one about annual in- and outflows that make up the organisations activities over years and the short-term ones associated with current transactions. Maintaining a balance between those two is important for an organisation.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>To interpret financial statement they have to be received first and some companies need to publish financial results, e.g. publicly traded ones. You should read the data, draw your first conclusions and then calculate some ratios (ROCE, ROI, asset turnover, return on sales, current, liquidity, stock turnover, debtors and creditors turnover,). Outside parties could use these statements to assess creditworthiness as it gives clue to its ability to survive and grow. Internal data can be analysed in the same way and remember that external documents are under review to see if bad sides cannot be hidden in compliance with governing body&#8217;s laws.</p>

<p>To start a company or expand, cash is needed which will flow from cash to acquiring products, building products, selling these products and getting back cash. There are some accounting terms that should be known:</p>

<ul>
<li>expenses (anything producing costs and that will be used up)</li>
<li>stock (cost of items that are not yet used up)</li>
<li>fixed assets (premises, equipment, used for the long-term)</li>
</ul>


<p>Stock is part of something called working capital (or net current assets) which can include:
- debtors (accounts receivable, within 12 months)
- creditors (accounts payable, within 12 months)
- cash
- accrued expenses, revenue, revenues received in advance and prepayments (used to reflect some things on the balance sheet at the end of a period)</p>

<p>Fixed assets should be bought with money that does not need to be repayed in a long time because otherwise repaying might require selling the fixed asset. Long-term loans should not be used to pay for short term assets as profit could be used for repaying these short term loans. If there is a continuous lag between inputs consumed and money received, long-term systems can be used.</p>

<p>Remember that raising cash has a cost to it, namely the cost of capital which can also be an opportunity cost and you should only lend for how long you need it.</p>

<p>There are several characteristics for capital for for-profit companies:
Capital:
-   either permanent
o   in relation to the owner/partner where there is no difference between assets of the organisation and the partner
o   shareholders who is in general not liable for the depts
-   or redeemable
o   redeemable preference shares
o   loans
o   financial instruments</p>

<ul>
<li>either long term (permanent is always long-term)</li>
<li><p>or short term (overdrafts are generally not included in the sources for capital as they are short-term)</p></li>
<li><p>either secured (to reduce probability of losing money; mortgage loans on machines)</p></li>
<li><p>or unsecured (paid off before shareholders get money in liquidation)</p></li>
<li><p>either fixed rewards (also applies for preference shares which are paid first at a fixed rate in case of dividends)</p></li>
<li>variable rewards</li>
</ul>


<p>It should be remembered that retaining profits might lead to larger profits if used right. Because they can be paid out at any time they are argued to be short-term and are often converted to long-term financials by issuing new shares to existing shareholders, reducing the amount of retained profits by an equal amount.</p>

<p>In public sector organisations the permanent capital comes from the government but sometimes these organisations can also get short- or long-term loans. In general, fixed assets are accumulated over many many years and finances by general revenue and by loans. Governments need to raise capital to cover costs which results in a budget deficit. Mostly, security is provided by governments and sometimes on the private assets of the taxpayers. Taxes can be said to have an opportunity cost in relation to the taxpayer investing the money.</p>

<p>Another field are private non-profit organisations, who use donations to cover their operating costs. This money does not have to be repaid but donors are entitled to assurance that they money is used for what they paid it for (arguably effectively and efficiently).</p>

<p>The organisations and investors have to be brought together, which might be pension and life-assurance fund managers, banks, multinational investment corporations or government bodies on one end and intermediaries which deal with small businesses and non-profit clubs. Capital is provided at a cost that reflects demand and supply.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tighter controls have often resulted in greater resistance and from a behavioural perspective, management controlling should be seen as a social process that has interactive parts and can have negative effects. This book will focus on the behavioural aspect. Some targets and controls are motivating while others de-motivate which makes it important to try to understand why they go each way.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Controlling refers to ensuring conformity with plans and targets:
&quot;A process of monitoring performance and taking actions to ensure intended or desired results&quot; - Baird, Post and Mahon, 1990, p.454
&quot;Any process in which a person or group of persons determines, that is, intentionally affects, what another person or group will do&quot; - Tannebaum, 1962, p.2
But why do you need it?
&quot;Control, like a ship&#8217;s rudder, keeps the organisation moving in the proper direction&quot; - Barney, 1992, p379</p>

<p>There is both horizontal and vertical control and it is many times used by superiors to as a demonstration of their competence as they should their &quot;authority&quot;. Child (1977) suggests that control works best with clear reason and objective to justify it. In that sense it is important to review objectives of departments and see how these objectives translate into individual goals/targets and which controls are in place for these.</p>

<p>The control process works like this:
1. Establish strategic objective
2. Establish standards of performance
3. Measure actual performance
4. Compare performance to standards
If inadequate -&gt; 5.1 Take corrective action
If adequate -&gt; 5.2 Do nothing or provide reinforcement</p>

<p>Remember that goals should be SMART and that each of the above steps influences behaviour as people might try to find a way &quot;out&quot; of the measures. Also remember to keep the full picture in mind and try not to have a favourite measurement. Include many sources if possible, including qualitative data. If you need to take action, again, full picture, and think about changing the targets in line with what you learned.</p>

<p>The reality of all of this is messier and more socially embedded and highly conditional upon social expectation, social relationships and social meanings. The devil is in the detail and has a major influence on acceptance of controls. You can have the four stages in place but still fail due to other problems.</p>

<p>Types of control include:
- Direct supervision: Management by walking around (MBWA) might be problematic and susceptible to allegations of bullying. Sometimes it is a built in formal requirement.
- Technical controls: impersonal, embedded in technology, e.g. assembly line. Technology might be designed to secure compliance with planned procedures (call centre staff recorded, computer logging,). Too high control will result in high labour turnover and difficulties in recruitment.
- Administrative controls: formal rules, budgets, job categories, promotion procedures, job responsibilities. Some of this is changing from having lots of layers in a company leading to lots of potential steps to go up and lots of bonuses. Now layers collapsed and new controls needed. Also for budgets, these are more and more done with agreement of employees. (They need to share their views, not agree).</p>

<p>Post modern forms of control put a premium not on obedience and conformity but on commitment, responsiveness and flexibility (TQM, Business excellence, psychological contract). A lot of focus is put on recruitment, selection, induction, appraisal, promotion and a rewards system. But critics point out that this is making more demands on the psyche.</p>

<p>&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Classical controls&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Post-modern controls&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mass, standardised production&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;flexible, multi-batch production&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;hierarchical, bureaucratic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;flax, flexible, decentralised&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Administrative controls&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Normative controls&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Institutional controls&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Identity Control&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;insecurity based on collective injustice&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;insecurity based on individual self-doubt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</p>

<p>All this needs a more organic control system to enable rapid informed responses with employee empowerment. Current companies are moving away from the mechanic (fragmentation of tasks, supervision, precise definition, instruction, vertical control,) to the organic (specialist knowledge, adjustment of tasks, flexible, wide roles, horizontal and network control,) control.</p>

<p>This makes the psychological contract very important especially if people are self-controlling.</p>

<p>There is a distinct difference between the abstract model and the implementation which can be seen in the vicious cycle of control in which a manager perceives a need for control, imposes tighter control, employees become resentful and withhold discretionary effort, which brings further decline, which brings more control and more resistance &#8230; all this might undermine the moral and effectiveness of an organisation. There is research though that, for example in Britain, there is a positive correlation between certain controls and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Tannebaum argued that the amount of control is not a fixed-sum game, meaning that you can have more control but also give more opportunities for participation and influence. Controls need leadership to be understood and if there are deficiencies, e.g. in the clarity of the job description, then these need to be fixed first. The wider social system needs to be taken into account.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everything you do involves approximations and sophistication can give rise to misplaced confidence in the accuracy of the output. This might be false. Again, there are two case studies.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>A: a university student cost report
In this case it is important to know which students cost how much and how much revenue they create. It is also important that if you are a public service you need to show that you might have more students that are more costly and would therefore need more money than other universities. This also helps allocating resources in the right way. Greater disclosure, greater accountability can form the basis for better economic decision.</p>

<p>Cost data is open to misunderstanding, is easily misinterpreted and can lead to faulty decisions and expensive failures. It is important to be familiar with the assumptions operating behind the cost data it generates and to be sure of how the data can and cannot be used.</p>

<p>B: Changing the costing menu
In the 1980s Johnson and Kaplan wrote Relevance Lost which formed the basis of the currently popular activity based costing which is used to have greater insight into its costs.</p>

<p>Again you look at what kind of different that you have and then look at your costs based on what this product really uses. In the case of this kitchen, menus are looked at in terms of % of kitchen labour, % of direct costs, how many special ingredients are used, … all on a per menu basis to find the cost per menu in a meaningful way. This helps setting your price.</p>

<p>Remember that costs are never correct, just reasonable and reasonableness of data systems is not constant.</p>

<p>In total this showed that calculations and analysis are a matter of judgement, exploring different methods of analysing costs to gain better understanding and find things interesting for management.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This booklet includes two case studies.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>A: The wrong number planning problem
This about a company that outsourced its computer needs and now want to shut down the operation again due to the loss it makes. The general revenue and loss figures are not meaningful here though because it should be looked at what the mother company looses when the shop is closed. It would probably have to pay more for the services on the market. On top of that it needs to be made clear what the real costs are and what the contribution is to find out how many real hours are needed to brake even, which is harder if there is the mix of direct relations to the Mother Company as well as commercial services.</p>

<p>B: The shock results problem
Here a company seems to be on the brink of recovery but a closer variance analysis reviews something else. Important here is to split everything up for product group so that you see which costs should come to which products and which revenue to which products to see the profit and loss on a per product basis. You need to look at volume and price variance, meaning changes in revenue/profit based on changes therein. It is important to split the figures into manageable parts that are relevant to monitoring.</p>

<p>Here it is important that financial calculations and analysis can be used to improve organisational performance. Cost analysis should help better understand contributions of products and services and with the ideas you get, find techniques and applications of interest.</p>

<time datetime="2003-05-05T09:28:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 5<span>th</span>, 2003</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;The first approach to improving performance often is to tighten management control, especially in failing organisations, but this has some draw backs. Much of management control relies on feedback loops with a control loop being central.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Harvard Business review argued that management control is a translation of strategic goals into accounting-based controls. This booklet tries so show management control in broader terms. Without some mechanism of coordination and control there is no organisation, the author argues. (Dee Hock argued that without some shared belief there is no organisation.)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A control process, as of Maciarello (1984) entails:
1.  Set goals and performance measures
2.  Measure achievement
3.  Compare achievement with goals
4.  Compute the variances as a result of the preceding comparison
5.  Report the variances
6.  Determine cause(s) of variances
7.  Take action to eliminate the variances
8.  Follow up to ensure that goals are met&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Gareth Morgan suggested that it helps to understand organisations if you use metaphors, instead of trying to find the truth. The management control framework rests on two such metaphors: organisations as machines and organisations as information processing systems.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;As machines it involves seeing an organisation as functional departments split in jobs which are clearly defined to operate precisely with regular patterns. The idea is that orders from the top flow down till the bottom without error. This is used efficiently in things like fast food chains where specifying each task will help provide a consistent product.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In terms of information processing systems (cybernetic approach) you envision as system that can respond to its environment. Think of a control loop with improvements possible anywhere within that loop.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The weaknesses in both of those that neither are people machines or tasks as clearly specified (machines metaphor is only viable sometimes) and in the information processing metaphor the goals are seen as static or are externally determined which introduced the second control loop: double-loop learning. The first is about learning to cope and respond and the second to find new ways of seeing the world. (Japanese companies have much less informal system for control. See page 11 book 2)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Morgan suggests three barriers to double-loop learning.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A: Due to different functions, goals, objectives, inside the company for different people/departments, you stop seeing the bigger picture and boundaries are created inside the company. People will keep their place. Single loops might prevent double loops as this is seen as a basic challenge to the company.
B: There is usually a lot of playing with the numbers inside a company, often referred to as beaurocratic accountability. A change in goals involves uncertainty which many find hard to cope with.
C: There is a gap between what people say and what they do. Current nature is not often questioned and this will result in a system that will effectively prevent understand or dealing with problems. You need to challenge the values and norms embedded in the theories you use.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To overcome this Morgan suggests:
1.  Encourage and value and open and reflective approach and avoid a blame culture
2.  Encourage the use of multiple viewpoints, constructive conflict and debate.
3.  Do not impose overly specific goals, objectives or targets.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The booklet suggests that things are loosely coupled in today’s organisations and you need to understand performance from multiple perspectives, much like the balanced scorecard which is focussed on outcomes. What is needed is to look at enablers too, which is where the EFQM comes on, taking a holistic approach to performance and assumes that multiple stakeholders need to be satisfied at the same time. The holistic approach needs to look at dependencies as well as trade-offs and tensions that exist. (E.g. Hotel: tension between ROA and customer satisfaction in filling more rooms that are available)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Organisational rules are loosely coupled with how people behave and customer satisfaction is loosely coupled with coupled with customer loyalty, Xerox for example linked 1% in customer satisfaction to 0.05% in customer retention, which is rare precision.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The EFQM model suggests that there are five performance enablers and 4 performance outcomes. It suggests that it can be used for:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;develop vision and goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand systemic nature, linkages, cause and effect &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;basis of the EFQM award&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assessing current health of the organisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;More info at http://www.efqm.org/&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Following is a case study of how United Utilities plc used a mix of balanced scorecard and the EFQM model to management performance. They broke down myths, changed attitudes, and used the balanced scorecard as more of a strategic framework. They also used the business excellence model for continuous improvement. Two key perspectives were used. The people perspective involved people satisfaction, culture and alignment with business goals. The customer perspective involved to consult, listen, act and demonstrate. They have turned out to radically change the role that the finance professionals will play in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This example is for the financial department and shows how they re-examined both core goals and how they assess their performance.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Summarising, this showed how management control involves a control loop, how to achieve organisational goals to co-ordinating and controlling activities. It also showed how metaphors can be sued, what double-loop learning is and what role EFQM plays.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Management control is largely monetary control but done to reach strategic goals. Improved management control can be a starting point for improving performance.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>As a great deal of management control information is monetary it is important that you understand how this information was gathered as well as how it is shown. The wrong kinds of information can distort decision making. Different ways of allocating costs can lead to different decisions.</p>

<p>There is also a people perspective which depends on individual psychology, social interactions and individual actions.</p>

<p>Cash flow is said to be the livelihood if the lifeblood of an organisation and managing cash flow is important.</p>

<p>Following is the strategic view of performance. This includes marketing processes, operations perspective and processes of management. It also involves how employee involvement can help as well as team working.</p>

<p>The service sector will be discussed and an interface with customers to improve service delivery is talked about. In this sense, this is marketing as a process of building relationships and needs different approaches to improving performance. This is followed up with supply chain management and operations capabilities.</p>

<p>Bringing it all together in a strategic approach to marketing, the importance of leadership and a big case study follows.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Evaluations needs to be planned and the 4Es might be a good framework and you need to close the loop from asking questions, getting answers to drawing conclusions.</p>

<p>Performance measurement measures outputs to compare to desired outcomes.
Performance management uses performance measurement to intervene.
Evaluation looks at both from several perspectives to find need for further actions.</p>

<p>There is a strategic and operation evaluation with both focussing either on outcomes or processes. Evaluation involves looking at the interests of several stakeholders inline with operational performance or strategic development.</p>

<p>These can be done to make you look good and as good management practice. Some evaluations have no real purpose but otherwise they will be about:

- Proving (Efficiency)
- Improving
- Controlling (Effectiveness)</p>

<p>What criteria?
When evaluating intervention look at goals originally set: &quot;Is it working as we had intended.&quot; These have to be concrete and fit for measurements. If you are only looking at goals you are preventing finding out about the effects. Also, one stakeholder might be happy with the outcome but others might not.</p>

<p>This is where Scriven&#8217;s approach of goal-free/needs-based evaluation comes in.
1. Less likely to miss unanticipated outcomes
2. More open for negatives
3. Remove goals bias
4. Maintain objectivity and independence.</p>

<p>Scriven&#8217;s noted that the less an external evaluator knows about the goals, the less tunnel vision he will have. You normally need to take the original objective into account though.</p>

<p>To set meaningful goals:
- distinguish between outcome goals and activities
- Outcome goals should be clearly outcome oriented
- finding out if desired outcome has not been attained needs to be possible.
- Goals and objectives should be understandable
- Separate goals from indicators
- don&#8217;t borrow another organisation&#8217;s goals</p>

<p>Illuminative evaluation is another method which is not connected to a goal and more there to check understanding of a situation. The first stop is normally a concern and then you draw views and info together. From there you move on to clarification focussing down on the specifics for new understanding. This form of evaluation might be contested though as it does not rely on facts. Facilitation is important.</p>

<p>Who is the evaluation for?
Difference between performance measurements and evaluation is the focus on doing it for specific stakeholders. You need to:
- Report positive and negative
- look at possible short time positives that are negative for the long term
- look at (harmful) indirect affects on other stakeholder groups</p>

<p>Who should do the evaluation?
Some by management and others by specialists which depends on:
- Accountability to others
- Insufficient expertise inside
- Controversial subject</p>

<p>You need to choose for technical as well as personal skills and credibility. Remember that evaluations cost money, both direct (data processing and consumables) and indirect (staff time) and possibly opportunity costs.</p>

<p>How to do it?
For collecting data you have several sources (B18P27):
- Record keeping
- Archival data
- Benchmark data
- Questionnaire surveys</p>

<p>Patton has created an utilisation-focused outcomes framework:
1. Client target group
2. desired outcome(s) for the target group
3. One or more indicators for each desired outcome
4. Performance targets
5. Details of data collection
6. How the results will be used</p>

<p>Economic evaluation aim to clarify, quantify and value all the relevant options, their inputs and consequences. For a cost-benefit analysis you need to make in/out values monetary to compare. Cost-effectiveness will use a common measurement for outputs (e.g. lives saved) which leads to a money per unit level.</p>

<p>When doing your evaluations, make sure your data is unbiased and you have co-operation by the staff. There are several influences on the evaluation though:
1. Evaluator characteristics
2. User characteristics
3. Contextual characteristics
4. Evaluation characteristics</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Benchmarking is the pursuit of the best organisations out there (in your field) to learn from their successful practices. This is a continuous thing and you should look at the processes in connection with the results to find out how to improve your processes in case your results lag behind (process benchmarking in relation to results benchmarking).</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Problems:
- Hard to identify the best
- catching up might be impossible -&gt; de-motivating
- You are catching up to a moving target
- copying is not innovating</p>

<p>Benchmarking has now moving from simply financial analysis to competitor analysis to performance benchmarking to best practice process benchmarking</p>

<p>It seems to be seen as the easy and manageable way to find the best and improve.</p>

<p>Types of Benchmarking
1. Internal benchmarking: one area against another or e.g. one hotel against another; data is easily obtainable; not looking at best as such;
2. Competitive benchmarking: look at competitors in same sector; big companies often have info public in reports otherwise they need to be willing to share;
3. Functional benchmarking: only methods are looked at which can happen over sectors; can lea to innovative things as not bound to your sector
4. Generic benchmarking: just look at others to learn e.g. for safety issues.</p>

<p>To correctly describe processes you need to be able to describe them -&gt; process mapping. 1996 Fisher described a few possibilities.</p>

<ol>
<li>Performances and practices
On one side of a wall list the processes and on the other the elements of those processes that needs to be discussed.</li>
<li>Flow Charting
You use symbolic language to convey sequential steps. X-Achsis would be the symbols and Y-achsis the steps. One of the symbols could be delay for example.</li>
<li>Arrow/mind map
Shows interrelations by a series of decision trees.</li>
<li>Cause and effect
Draw a timeline with herringbone lines where some thing effects the operation. Show links between units.</li>
<li>Supply chain
Building a chain by linking essential elements.</li>
<li>Matrix
Useful where you need two perspectives like staffing company and department.</li>
</ol>


<p>You need to choose that technique that will get you to the heart of the matter and then ask the right people if you are correct as verification.</p>

<p>Problems of benchmarking include:
- What to benchmark
- Who is &quot;best in class&quot;
- Staff resistance
- Resource constraints
- Confidentiality
- Sometimes process components are un-transferable
- The focus is not in tomorrow</p>

<p>To do benchmarking well you need:
- Position of benchmarking champion with full management support and enough resources and authority
- get the right people on the team
- Co-ordinate for continual work
- create information partnerships with other companies/departments</p>

<p>Why you benchmark can have a number of reasons. In the public sector it is mostly done for accountability reasons and to protect against criticism.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A plan will detail the expected outputs during a specific time and there are long-term (5-10 years, aggregate capacity plan), medium-term (2-5 years, making resources available to meet long-term plan, resources are mostly inflexible), short-term (1-2 years, priorities need changing due to unexpected things)</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Operations planning = acquire and manage resources needed for the future
Operations control = implementing plans and adjusting work to achieve plan</p>

<p>Organisational strategy, influenced by marketing and financial strategy, influences the operations but is not under its control. Resource and demand planning influence operations planning -&gt; operations scheduling -&gt; operations control (planning to control).</p>

<p>Planning is very important, especially in big organisations, because a bad plan will lead to higher costs due to too high stocks, poor customer service,&#8230;Plans make implications of decisions visible (marketing says higher stock and finance says less cost) and a schedule makes implications of actions clear (e.g. filling beds in a hospital)</p>

<p>The main planning and control responsibilities are managing capacity which means:
- understanding and measure your capacity to output
- understand and measure the demand
- try to match those two</p>

<p>In capacity measurement it is important to measure the right thing.</p>

<p>Once you have found the level of capacity needed you will need to find out where to put your facilities which is where the economies of scale come in. These work, until a set amount when the complexity of the operation will be too high and the cost will rise again. You will also take into account your closeness to your markets, transportation of your goods, resources and more.</p>

<p>Forecasting demand involves looking at you environment (PEST, STEEP) and the product life-cycle needs to be taken into account (Introduction, take-off, slow-down, maturity, decline; book 16, page 11).</p>

<p>Then you need to match capacity and demand both long-term but also now which will see a lot of fluctuations. There are several strategies:
- Level capacity: keeping it constant despite fluctuations, might be maximum level like emergency service; for manufacturing its ok to store often time
- Chase demand: adjusting to meet demand; e.g. tourist attraction hiring more people in the summer
- Demand management: change demand to match capacity (sometimes possible): e.g. by varying the price; reservation of capacity by clients; complementary goods</p>

<p>The next important thing is scheduling, which is about matching the flow of inputs with the outputs in the short term.
1. Production scheduling can be both push and pull scheduling. Push would focus on the output target and adapt everything else to achieve that, which might lead to high stocks of components if you have a problem along the line. Pull is the basis for the Japanese just-in-time concept, which means that if no input is needed then the previous step will not create an output. This might put everything to halt at problems but you have little unsold stock.</p>

<ol>
<li>Managing the customer order cycle involves thinking about what can be done before an order by a customer:</li>
<li>Resource-to-order: resources bought at order, e.g. catering or major projects like a dam</li>
<li>Make-to-order: no work done until order received; e.g. customer bikes</li>
<li><p>Make-to-stock: everything is done beforehand; e.g. stereo system, pre made sandwiches</p></li>
<li><p>Queuing is used with service operations as the product cannot be produced in advance, which results in creating a &quot;stock&quot; of customers waiting to be served. With this you need to think about:</p></li>
<li>What capacity level do I need for adequate service?</li>
<li>Queue management for least negative impact on customer satisfaction</li>
<li>How to physically manage the queue
E.g. one queue/ two cashiers or two cashiers splitting up task.</li>
</ol>


<p>Other option: entertain, ads, productive use (forms at a doctor)</p>

<p>Sequencing is about assigning priorities: first come, first served; shortest processing time; customer priority; easiest due date</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Value proposition)</p>

<p>This part is about the value propositions within Piercy&#8217;s strategic pathway to be market-led, which started with market choices and ends with key relationships.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>A. Building the value proposition
Marketing is a) marketing planning and decision making and b) a company wide market orientation. The value proposition is about building a product that is differentiated from other products with a company wide focus for unique value to the customer.</p>

<p>Piercy recognizes two different kinds of segmentation:
-  Explicit: by means of market research to understand behaviour and develop segmentation and positioning based on that knowledge.
- Implicit: by ways of focus on a value proposition with targeting and segmentation being company wide issues.</p>

<p> The value proposition is made up of
- Product and service attributes (functionality, quality, price, time)
- Position (brand, intangible assets)
- Customer segment (relationship)</p>

<p>Finding a value proposition:
1.  What is our mission?
A mission statement might include: philosophy, specifications of market domain, key values, and critical success factors. This should be the start of the company and possibly include the value proposition.</p>

<ol>
<li>Define your market and market segments (segmentation).</li>
<li>Find an attractive market/segment. (Targeting)</li>
<li>What are our (competitive) differentiating capabilities?
This can come from three sources:</li>
<li>Product or service itself</li>
<li>Added-value services</li>
<li><p>Marketing intangibilities
These normally come out of you core competencies and strategic position. E-commerce would be one for Amazon and the logistics involved are used to offer superior customer value. These have to be reviewed periodically as others might catch up.</p></li>
<li><p>Strategicly position yourself
This can come from the value disciplines being operational excellence (Dell, FedEx, and MacDo), product leadership (Marks&amp;Spencer, British Airways) and customer intimacy (IBM, Home Depot, and Four Seasons Hotels)</p></li>
</ol>


<p>These are not mutually exclusive and it should be chosen based on whether competitors can easily imitate you and if your organisation&#8217;s capabilities match the activities needed.</p>

<ol>
<li>What are our marketing assets and brands?
Davidson (1997) coined the term asset-based marketing which talks about all core competencies being included.
“A core competency is the gold standard. It is a bundle of related skills, leading to a key consumer benefit, and completely unique.&quot; - Davidson, 1997
These would include:</li>
<li>Customer relationships (loyalty and trust helps defend market share)</li>
<li>channel power (market share, shelf space, e.g. ice cream sometimes owning the one freezer in a shop)</li>
<li>Market information (understanding and faster response)</li>
<li>reputation and brand (includes more than just the visible but also invisible key assets and competencies like service level, low-cost operation, strong supply chain, strong R&amp;D, &#8230; known as the branding iceberg)</li>
</ol>


<p>The importance of the brand is seen when you look at what influences the customer:
- own experience
- Reference groups (famous sponsor)
- Belief of brand effectiveness
- Feelings about brand appearance</p>

<p>There are three other things to take into account:
- Service positioning (customers look at: reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy, and responsiveness)
- Key relationships (customers, competitors, collaborators, co-workers)
- Translate strategy into account which includes performance indicators (e.g. balanced scorecard)</p>
