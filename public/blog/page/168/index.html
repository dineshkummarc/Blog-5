  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Operating System Wars are hotting up again. Can Novell come back with their buy of SuSe? Here is <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/odi-04.11.03-000/">a story on Heise (German)</a> about it and <a href="http://rss.com.com/2100-7344_3-5101680.html">here on News.com</a> and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/33770.html">here on The Register</a>. Would be fun seeing Novell come back bigtime ;) But $210 Million made some people a bundle today. Good for German entrepreneurs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few interesting uses of the Amazon API, mostly taken <a href="http://erikbenson.com/index.cgi?node=Amazon%20API">from this page</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://simplest-shop.com/">Simplest Shop</a> is simply another interface to Amazon. This just shows how far this can go and Amazon actually shouldn&#8217;t really care. <a href="http://addassociate.com/">Add Associate</a> is actually still in Beta but might become something like content targetted Amazon Shopping Links. Nice. <a href="http://www.pmbrowser.info/amazon.html">PM Browser</a> is a nice way to browse books a bit differently. As is <a href="http://www.langreiter.com/space/amzn-vista">Amzn-vista</a> which uses the &quot;People also read&quot; feature from Amazon to give you some suggestions in a nice way.</p>

<p>I think I&#8217;ll have to look into the <a href="http://scripts.incutio.com/amazon/">PHP capabilities</a> with this thing and try it out&#8230; when I find the time :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The last few days several things collected inside my reading list via <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>. For one, I found Heiko Hebig&#8217;s blog at <a href="http://www.hebig.com/">hebig.com</a> and already have some interesting items to think about thanks to him.</p>

<ol>
<li>It seems that the Samwer brothers, who already cloned eBay in Germany and sold it to eBay a few months later and who now run Jamba, an SMS/Ringtone/Mobilephone/MMS/&#8230; portal, have now gone back to the cloning route and born <a href="http://www.myfriends.de/">MyFriends</a>.</li>
<li>Secondly, he <a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/001639.shtml">talk about Wallop</a>, seemingly a blogging tool currently being developed inside Microsoft. I actually found him via <a href="http://www.marketingwonk.com/archives/2003/10/31/microsoft_to_launch_blog_index_tool/index.php?rss1">a post on Marketingwonk</a> about <a href="http://mywallop.com/">Wallop</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/001651.shtml">Here</a> is another pointer by him about the valuation of Friendster.com. eBay is given as a comparison there but I have to say that the look at market cap versus revenue doesn&#8217;t stick. Taking market cap versus profit, the valuation for ebay is still high but it&#8217;s probably a lot more ok if you factor in their growth. It seems though that we are getting back on track for wanting growth above anything else, which is what Friendster is really doing. Growing, nothing much more.</li>
<li>Heise is <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/bo-02.11.03-002/">reporting</a> that you can now only take part in the US Greencard Lottery via <a href="http://dvlottery.state.gov/">dvlottery.state.gov</a>. I already sent in my application via a german company and they actually should handle the transfer to digital of my information. I&#8217;ll better check though.</li>
<li>Yahoo is <a href="http://www.adweek.com/aw/iq_interactive/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=2013582">moving it&#8217;s media budget</a> to MindShare and actually seems to do a bit of reshuffling in the creative help too. Weird to see Yahoo going for help in terms of creatives. Ok, probably for different media but still.</li>
<li>Marketingwonk <a href="http://www.marketingwonk.com/archives/2003/10/31/roi_scares_offline_media_boon_to_online/index.php?rss1">links to a story</a> on MediaLife about how old media has to face the facts and show ROI for advertisement, something possible on the Internet. The problem here I think is that you need to find a real method of valuing Branding on the Internet, which is not factored in for this ROI calculation most of the time. Still, good thoughts and <a href="http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2003/oct03/oct27/5_fri/news5friday.html">interesting article</a>.</li>
<li>Searchenginewatch has <a href="http://www.searchenginewatch.com/searchday/article.php/3096451">an article about the Google API</a> that actually covers a lot more APIs, something I am starting to get interested in at the moment. If you check out <a href="http://erikbenson.com/index.cgi?node=Amazon%20API">this site</a> you will find some very interesting uses of the Amazon API for example. Great stuff.</li>
<li>Another interesting item in my saved items on Bloglines is <a href="http://www.marketingwonk.com/archives/2003/10/28/selling_online_media_to_nonbelievers/index.php?rss1">this post</a> on Marketingwonk about selling online media to non-beliefers. Some interesting points there too, but I&#8217;d like to add one thing. The <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/dtls_dsp_Spin.cfm?fnl=031028">article</a> talks about the problem the clients can&#8217;t see their ads online. The solution that I see is a lot more simple. Let the customer see their ads online. Recently, web.de had an exlusive ad (called Web.Buster , their term ;)) which resulted in Harry Potter advertisement on ALL of web.de. Every single Advertising spot (banner spot that is) was a Harry Potter ad. Now there it&#8217;s easy to show your boss that you have advertising online. But this kind of exclusivity will bring a bit of challenge to management the advertising but this is actually were it is going to go.</li>

<time datetime="2003-11-01T18:09:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 1<span>st</span>, 2003</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I did it. I switched to Panther, Apple&#8217;s MacOS X.3. I went to the shop two days ago, got my personal installation and went right ahead with the &quot;easy&quot; installation. The entire process went along just fine and then I rebooted and was a happy camper until I tried to log in. It just crashed, inluding the finder and all that was possible was turning the laptop off.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The problem was a virtual desktop application that was being loaded at startup and it just crashed everything. This should not happen. Period, no discussions. The application can crash but not the entire OS. I then logged in with the shift key pressed, something that results in all your personal extensions not being loaded. I then removed the application and am now happily using Expose to get arround my applications. I love it. Really.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I also really like the option to put labels to files. Especially on the desktop it makes finding things a lot easier. And I am starting to change my working behaviour though due to <a href="http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000964.php">Expose</a>. The desktop really becomes the desktop. You put the things on there that you are working on there now, at this moment. The applications quickly move out of the way with a press of F11 or a simple move to the bottom right screen corner.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I had another problem with the FileVault though which resulted in me changing arround the entire system of how I set up the laptop. For one, I moved all Pictures and MP3s to the Shared folder under Users. My home directory holds more or less the documents I am currently using, things I really work on, all my indexed mail from <a href="http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000959.php">Zoe</a> and a few other things. I still don&#8217;t have the FileVault turned on though, and I suggest you don&#8217;t either. FileVault encrypted my entire homedirectory, restarted and I then was happily sitting looking at a full clean homedirectory, all my stuff being gone. Well it actually wasn&#8217;t gone, but the preferences said that the FileVault is still turned off and I presume this resulted in the OS not decrypting my home directory on the fly. Thankfully you can open the encrypted file that is sitting in your home directory and I managed to get almost all my stuff back. Some preferences cannot be overwritten but that&#8217;s ok. Things are back working again, even though with some pain.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The next problem I currently have is that I can&#8217;t setup new users and I am not sure if that is a general problem with my installation or a problem with Panther. I still have to dig closer into this though. With fast user switching I&#8217;d actually like to set up a few more users for special tasks, especially in relation to encrypted home folders.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After the system is fully working now I have to say that while the move itself was a bit painful, the place I am at now, with a fully running Panther, is very nice. I like the improvements and I think it was money well spent. I am becomeing more productive and like my system a bit better again. Apple is on the right way with this thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just found <a href="http://www.marketingwonk.com/archives/2003/10/30/google_seeks_best_bidders_not_highest_bidders/index.php?rss1">this short bit</a> on MarketingWonk, my new daily reading and a really nice and informative side. For all those wanting to delve down into how the Google ranking works, here is a short introduction.</p>

<p>The formula for the top rank at Google is likely very close to something like</p>

<p>CTR<em>CPC</em>1000 = RPM</p>

<p>CTR = Click-Through Ratio
CPC = Cost-per-Click
RPM = Revenue per thousand (M coming from Roman numerology)</p>

<p>This in effect gives you a number and the higher the number the more money Google earns with that advertiser for that keyword. An example will make it clear.</p>

<p>Advertiser 1 is paying $1 per Click and has a 5% clickthrough rate.
Advertiser 2 is paying $0.5 per Click but has a 15% clickthrough rate.</p>

<p>Other pay-per-click sites now put Advertiser 1 above Advertiser 2. Google would put Advertiser 2 above Advertiser 1. Why?</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s looks at 1000 searches for the keyword they are both advertising on.</p>

<p>Advertiser 1: $1<em>1000</em>0.05=$50
Advertiser 2: $0.5<em>1000</em>0.15=$75</p>

<p>It makes more sense to put 2 on top and give him this little extra push in clickthroughs to increase your revenue. You also want to make that advertiser happy.</p>

<p>As a side effect, the ad more clicks is guessed to be the one more relevant for he user. This is where we are getting very complicated though and as Kevin said in the comments, you need to see which position, wording, CPC, &#8230; is right for you and your campaign. This would be going to deep for this short introduction. It&#8217;s a great field.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&#8217;s put it like this. It doesn&#8217;t sell for places that sell it as a gaming platform. Two things here.</p>

<ol>
<li>Gamers hate it and hated it since E3, or so it seems.</li>
<li>Placed that sell it as a game deck, don&#8217;t subsidise it with their monthly airtime&#8230;</li>
</ol>


<p>Telecom providers do! They are selling it for 150â‚¬ and more off the standard price. I can now have the N-Gage for 180â‚¬ easily as a phone and will likely find it for less. It won&#8217;t sell like this in retail outlets that focus on games, especially because it needs a network connection anyway.</p>

<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what Nokia does next. Check out a bit more about this <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/68/33680.html">at this The Register story</a>.</p>
