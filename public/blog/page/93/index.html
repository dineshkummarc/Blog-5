  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Om Malik has <a href="http://gigaom.com/2005/01/04/six-apart-to-buy-live-journal/">an exclusive post</a> reporting that <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a> is close to buying <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a>! Very big news there, which, if true, will make my <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/happy_new_year.html">new years guess</a> of Six Apart going public more likely. Remember that as of Alexa, TypePad is not at <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http://typepad.com">place 765</a> world wide, while Blogs.com (also TypePad) is <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http://blogs.com">at place 2814</a> and LiveJournal is at <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http://livejournal.com">place 565</a>! Some of the big sites out there seem to be moving together there. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;As they would also get the people behind LiveJournal they would get some hell of a knowledge of keeping a big service scaling, some amazing open source applications and a good infrastructur. Just check out <a href="http://www.danga.com/">danga.com</a> and check the <a href="http://www.danga.com/words/2004_oscon/">presentation from Brad (founder of LiveJournal) at Oscon 2004</a> which gives a bit of detail on the LiveJournal Infrastructure, Memcached, tweaking MySQL, BigIP, lots of big hardware. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;As most of LiveJournal&#8217;s users are using the service for free, Six Apart&#8217;s <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/11/six_apart_is_bi.html">deal with Kanoodle</a> might allow them to monetize all that, if the LiveJournal users allow that. I would also be back where I started, because as I <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/03/three_years_and.html">posted beginning 2004</a>, I started on LiveJournal beginning of 2001!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;It would be an interesting match and I wish the best of luck to both teams to reach a good conclusion and get what they want out of it!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/2005/01/six_apart_acqui.shtml">Rumors are true.</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You might wonder what I mean with that headline but this is just what I found on Frank Boosman&#8217;s blog: &lt;a title=&quot;When Does $350 Million Equal 42 Hours?&quot; href=&quot;http://www.boosman.com/blog/archives/2005/01/when_does_350_m.html&quot;&gt;pseudorandom: When Does $350 Million Equal 42 Hours?&lt;/a&gt;.</p>

<p>&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.boosman.com/blog/archives/2005/01/when_does_350_m.html&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&#8230;] the war in Iraq has cost $130 billion to date (per the Office of Management and Budget). [&#8230;], which in turn equals $198,730,732 per day.</p>

<p>In other words, the total amount committed by the US government to date for tsunami relief &#8211; $350,000,000 &#8211; equals 42.27 hours of the cost of the war in Iraq. [&#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>Oh boy, does put things in perspective doesn&#8217;t it? Thanks for that one Frank.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/2005/01/the_cost_of_kno.html">posted</a> on the cost of knowledge on the <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a> and some one part of the post made me include some blogging thoughts which I will repeat here.</p>

<p>This is really more about information than knowledge though and about a very small fraction of the thoughts about this. One thing to understand is that information is not like a normal resource in that it doesn&#8217;t get used up and once I have it, I don&#8217;t want it again. A lot of how we personally value information is in relation to the transaction costs attached to this information and this is where our current shift comes in.</p>

<p>For finding information I can more and more use RSS based services, including things like <a href="http://www.pubsub.com/">PubSub</a>. For creating it I can use a blog host. The harder part is the internalization bit, which is also about information overload in our time.</p>

<p>This is where the blogging bit comes in. Previously, when I wanted to find information I would use the New York Times (for example), partly because I trusted the source. This trust is based on relevance, quality and validity, with the relevance bit being how people choose the paper they read for example. Another option was always to read several papers, which is what lots of people did to get the real full picture. The problem there become the transaction costs of the process, as the more I increase the things I do read, the more problematic become the relevance and validity.</p>

<p>With blogging I can now increase the amount of different ideas I get fed into my head a thousand times, but with it comes the problem of trust as blogs are not held to the same journalistic standards as the New York Times. With a blog you will have to read some posts over a period of time for the trust to build, or you will need some good information about the poster and see who else trusts that person to be able to trust yourself. But then there will be an even deeper bond.</p>

<p>You will likely start reading a blog because it has some relevance to you (you like that person, want to follow their life, or are interested in the subject), you trust the quality and the content stays fresh (validity). Your choice in the end depends on the total transaction costs and these have just been brought down tremendously by RSS or Syndication in general. This is why Blogs will succeed. They take a lot longer to take hold, but the reputation of some print mag doesn&#8217;t come up over night either.</p>

<p>One thing that might speed up the readership of a personal blog would be to get some people to comment that are known, or to get some interviews on your site, some talk with other people, that shows that they trust you. Otherwise you need to just have to build up trust over time.</p>

<p>Simon said that &lt;I&gt;in a world where attention is a major scarce resource, information may be an expensive luxury, [&#8230;]&lt;/i&gt;. This is where sensemaking comes in. You gather, analyse, synthesise, share and re-use information, which becomes your cost of knowledge. The bottleneck is being removed by Bloglines and RSS (gather) and PubSub (analyse), to just name two. Synthesizing and sharing is what happens with blogs and my look into some fields will be the filtered information of somebody else.</p>

<p>In the end, for a big readership this blog for example is too unfocussed. I might bring value for a lot of people, but they are mostly doing this through finding entries via Google or other Search Engines. The real readership will be people that have followed this over months and feel that what I post is highly relevant for what they do, even though it is so diverse. For others, it will just be information overload.</p>

<p>All this means though that blogs are here to stay, and they will only grow in use and become more niche driven over time. With more power in computer, more focus on social networking as a service layer below an application, even the synthesis could be doable by an application. The future remains interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Being Digital&quot; Nicholas Negroponte, Director of the MIT Media Lab, recounts citing the value of his laptop at between one and two million USD. &quot;The point is that while the atoms were not worth that much, the bets were almost priceless.&quot; This is about the value stored within the laptop.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>A difference in valueing knowledge is that the source theoretically still holds it when it is shared. It can be said to be a collective good in that it can be shared with everyone. It might even help me to give you my information as your different perspective might give me new insight. This is really how internet protocols are developed in that a RFC (request for comment) is sent towards the development community where it is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Some value is highly linked to timing and circumstances e.g. insider trading. Information is also not really like physical goods in that once I have it I do not want more of it. It also doesn&#8217;t get used up (you need to keep that in your head firmly!). A lot of value in relation to information comes from the transaction costs, meaning the finding, creating, internalizing of information.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To assess the value of information you will either need to have it or have high trust in the source. It depends on relevance, quality and validity. Another option is to just not get information from one source but from several to get a complete picture, something that is evolving in blogging now. You read the New York Times for the one place to get the info, knowing that it has been published in relation to high journalistic standards. With a blog you will likely read several until you fully make up your mind, being confronted with several opinions on the way. After some time you will find some blogs where you trust the author, but this needs to be established. The choice depends on the total transaction costs of both models. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Information overload is another matter in that simon says: In a world where attention is a major scarce resource, information my be an expensive luxury, [&#8230;].&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sensemaking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This one is about gathering and interpreting a wealth of information. You gather, analyse, synthesise, share and re-use. The entirety of these steps is your cost of knowledge. It allows you to find bottlenecks in your strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To analyse knowledge inside a corporation, look at levels of tasks and then analyse these in terms of gather, &#8230;, re-use. Talk to people directly performing those tasks and remember that the politics of knowledge mean that things are never moving only towards efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Sensemaking also happens beyond the information processing model. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Karl Weick looked at organizational sensemaking, where the individual and the group or indivisible as things become real through interpretation. This model has a three step process: Enactment, Selection, Retention. Enactment here means the construction, re-ordering and re-arranging based on mental models of the group and the individual. There are two main drivers in this model: belief driven and action driven. There are also several levels. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intersubjective (I -&gt; We)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genericsubjective (Group)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extrasubjective (Culture)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Brenda Darvin talks about everyday sensemaking. We try to achieve shifting goals, hindered by obstacles at which point we move into sensemaking actions in relation to that obstacle. In a group this sensemaking is overlapping and conflicting. It really is in relation to our mental models not fitting together perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that the $75 million VC round wasn&#8217;t enough for Fastclick and now they are <a href="http://www.marketingvox.com/archives/2004/12/23/fastclick_to_go_ipo_doubleclick_bid_not_ruled_out/index.php?rss1">set to go public</a> for another $92 million. The bigger idea here is the resulting market cap for stock based acquisitions I presume with large parts of the money going into cash flow management especially if the acquire large publishers to run their ads. This is just a small push into the performance marketing place that I talked about earlier. As the article notes, it&#8217;s very sad for DoubleClick that they shed exactly that business some time ago and I am looking forward to seeing what happens to <a href="http://www.tribalfusion.com">Tribal Fusion</a> in all this move back to networks.</p>
