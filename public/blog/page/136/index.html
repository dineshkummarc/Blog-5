  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you might have noticed from the posts that happened in the last 24 hours, as well as the new <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/photos/dubai_/">Dubai 2004 Photo Album</a>, I am back from my Dubai holiday. 10 days of relaxation, reading, sun and fun. It was great.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>The hotel in Jebel Ali was very nice and the beach area and pools even nicer. The ocean had the exactly right temperature to be easy to get in and still remain refreshing, with a good set of waves from time to time. The 10 days just flew past us and we could actually have added another 3 days to the mix to get the relaxation process settled in. 10 days just seems to be the absolute bottom limit.</p>

<p>After two days of settling in, reading and doing nothing much, we took our first trip, being a safari tour with jeeps into the desert. Theme park rides can now no longer shock me. When you get to the desert, the drivers will let most off the air out of the tires to get better traction in the sand when going up and down the dunes and boy do they need it. I remember one jeep suddenly grinding to a halt, everybody jumping out really fast&#8230; somebody had obviously splattered some of their lunch over the back seats ;) I was actually getting close myself with the second 40 minutes ride after our stop at a camel farm. Our group in the jeep held out very well though and it was a fun ride with them. The evening finished with dinner in the dunes, which was actually good, setting on the floor, smoking a water pipe (apple tabacco kicks) and watching a belly dance. At our trip back to fill up the wheels again and go home, our driver wanted to not be last at the fill station and suddenly broke out to the right giving us another very speedy and hell ride through the desert with a few tiny jumps actually.</p>

<p>Another trip was obviously to take a look at the Burj al Arab, the 7 star hotel (their own term ;)) on an artificial island. Sadly photos were hardly allowed but I actually have to say that it was less impressive than I thought. Sure, everything is in gold but it could have been cold coloring. It&#8217;s not like there is a big sign saying &quot;This wall cost $2000000.&quot; or something. Sure it looks impressive, but it only really is if you think about it. We went there to have tea, as you cannot just go into the hotel without some kind of reservation. It was a full blown english tea for 30 EURs with wonderful choices of tea, great service and three different courses of different cakes and pastries, one tasting better than the last. It was actually a very good value which one wouldn&#8217;t have thought. It was also possible to go up to the 27th floor restaurant, giving a view of the first Palm of Dubai where construction of the streets and houses has now started. The second Palm was actually just being built in front of our hotel, with ship after ship coming in and blowing a mixture of sand and concrete into the water in a big arch as if it were water. The houses on this thing are actually not too expensive, with the biggest problem being that you are actually financing the Palm as you start paying now, with your house being finished arround 2008. As a price example though, there are penthouses on the top floor in the skyscrapers in the Marina with close to 400 square meters, 160 square meeters of sun roof with pool for $500.000 to buy.</p>

<p>The last trip we did was a tour through Dubai, trying to take a look at the cultural riches of the country. These sadly do not exist. The real history of Dubai kind of started in the 1950s really and one of the greatest cultural happenings is a one month shopping season in I think February. That should speak for itself. It was half a day and while the spice and gold souk (market) was very nice, as well as the boat trip, the most impressive part of the country is how the sheiks have build up the economy in a very efficient manner. Only 20% of the inhabitants of Dubai are natives and there are some fun little twist on how things work. Natives can get a free house when they marry natives, the have full medical payment (not service, that is being built) meaning that they get a trip to a foreign country doctor paid by the state, including somebody traveling with them for help.</p>

<p>A nice thing for cars is that there is a speed limit of 120 km/h and the cars start beeping when they go too fast. Well, not all of them, the expensive ones only beep once, which we noticed when we were driven back to the airport in a fully fitted Lexus including TV in the back of the front headrests.</p>

<p>I also took a gold course at the hotel which was very nice and it remains an interesting sport. I previously just hit a few balls on the driving range with a friend but having a real lesson helped not totally ruining my style ;) I now have muscle ache due to having gone clay pigeon shooting twice and the rifle is damn heavy. My right arm (I am left handed) hurts once I extend it and turn the palm of my hand upwards, as if holding the rifle. It was fun though.</p>

<p>Then of course it was lots of beach, pool, sun and getting the relaxation pool refilled. For that, I can only suggest Dubai. Especially in 5-10 years this city will be interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The full title is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/023113102X/bizkiffer-20">After the Empire: The Breakdown of the American Order (European Perspectives: A Series in Social Thought and Cultural</a>, writting by frenchman Emmanuel Todd. It&#8217;s really about the end of the USA as a supoerpower, a country that at the time of writing of the book (2002) needed an inflow of 1.2 Billion USD per day (1.5 Billion at the time of me writing this) to allow its overconsumption to continue. A country that at its then current level was would have burned through its oil reserves by 2010 (this book is not about oil though). A land which is fighting for democracy at a time when democracy is on the rise, due to increased literacy as one of the driving forces. there is actually some evidence given that there is at least a correlation between the two, if not a causation.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>In the book, Emmanuel Todd tries to give a few alternative view points on why the USA is acting like it is. In his mind it is mainly because America is dependant on the money from the outside and that the $ is being threatened by the coming of the EUR. It is not the most productive country with Japan beating it by a huge marging and the world wide democratization is going on strong with countries like Iran not being there yet but moving in the right direction, at their own pace.</p>

<p>While this is a way to complicated field for simple rules and for definite answers, Todd does have some interesting points that get the thinking process started. I would have wished for some more hard data on money flows, productivity and the like, but this might be a personal preference. Also, I might not agree with some of the points he makes, but the general direction he is talking about, and the general idea about the reasons behind the US behaviour do some arround as conclusive and agreeable. e.g. I do agree that the US has attacked Iraq at least partly to make a point about their supremacy and because Iraq was a very easy target, or so their thought.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t believe things ar eas easy as he puts them but then again, it&#8217;s only scratching the surface anyway, a good scratch though. A good read for those with an open mind.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is actually about another article in <a href="http://www.brandeins.de/">Brand Eins</a>. 20 years ago, nobody believed in private television in Germany and the RTL Chief Dieter Thoma was happpy that the screen was filled and had moving colours. The good thing was that ad-spots in public TV were so filled up that the private TV stations were removing the artificial scarcity of that resource. Today, 20% of advertising money goes to TV and 90% of that ggoes to the private channels (print is at 40%). RTL made 1.3 billion USD in 2002 in advertising. 12000 fixed and 4500 free employees work at private TV stations, excluding all the content providers.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>If you placed 6 spots on ARD and ZDF in the 70s you had a read of 70%, while today you will only get 50% when doing the same through all channels. Statistically viewers switch channels 63 times a day.</p>

<p>With digital TV coming in via the standard antenna, for free, soon, the amount of channels will likely increase, making special channels possible that cater to special audiences. But how to be profitable when most TV channels now aren&#8217;t? The integration of the entire value chain from fan magazine to CD and TV and Cinemae gets more important. New systems allow for users to pay for the show with the first installement of the UK Pop Idol having 35 Million callers. In germany this would have produced roughly 17 Million EURs in revenue, of which some go to the technology provider but still.</p>

<p>The new german channel 9Live takes all of this a step further, resulting in operational profits in 2003 close to 30 Million EURs. What they do is, for example, simply show you two pictures, asking for the error in one. you can then call and potentially win money, if you get through, and get the right answer. Simple quizes with annoying hosts, produced for next to nothing, making people get high phone bills. Now lots of people believe that 9Live is just a fad but they presumed as much with private television. Thanks to Peter Laudenbach for the article.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a very nice interview with Bolko von Oetinger, Senior VP and Director of the Boston Consulting Group and Chairman of the BCG Strategy-Institute, in this month&#8217;s <a href="http://www.brandeins.de/">Brand Eins</a> (Issue 03, April 2004)</p>

<p>His thoughts currently revolve arround the problems of capitalism and argues that capitalism/the economy was part of our culture but has now freed itself. It has taken up a life of its own and needs to be reintegrated into society or possibly will die. Cutting itself loose allowed for the financial scandals of our time. Profit is more important than trust in this new system and he quotes an article of Business Week from the hight of the crisis saying something like (translated by me from german): &quot;&lt;i&gt;Tell the trust, don&#8217;t distort the numbers, explain the situation to shareholders.&lt;/i&gt;&quot; As he puts it very well, this means that matter of course isn&#8217;t matter of course anymore. The trust is shrinking. We need to get it back, we need to put it first. We need to make sure that things that are matter of course should be.</p>

<p>On top of that, diversity of cultures need to be suppored. The different countries want to and should keep their own culture and the integration of this diversity is actually one of the most important distinct capabilities that EU members can build.</p>

<p>I am starting to feel more and more that make the importance of shareholder value above all else might not be the best thing. Of course you can always argue that the market for corporate control as it exists in the US will punish companies that do bad things but this is often after the fact and it only punished those if things are perceived as bad. Sometimes this might not be enough.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I actually read the <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/385842546X/">german translation</a> of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/2912485282/">Revelation$</a> and I haven&#8217;t found an english version. The book is about the inner workings of <a href="http://www.clearstream.com/">Clearstream</a>, kind of the bank of banks, used for example for storeing stock certificates. I noticed Clearstream when I moved my portfolio from Deutsche Bank to Citibank and got mailings stating that X shares of stock Y are in Clearstream locker Z in New York or some other city. The book starts with a very nice quote from Kurt Marti (1981) which I will try to translate from the german version: &lt;I&gt;Where would we come, if everyone said, where would we come and nobody went, to take a look, where one would come if one went.&lt;/I&gt;. But on to the review of the book.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>I have been interested in the financial markets for some time now and when I heard of &quot;Revelation$&quot; via a friend, I thought the book would fit my interest very well. This I still believe, it did fit. The problem is that it is written more like a complicated research report (which it is), lacking a really coherent story line.</p>

<p>You will learn something about how the clearing system behind Cedel-Clearstream works. You will find out that there is a little bit of similarity between the structure of Cedel and VISA in that ownership is kind of shares by lots of banks, bu you won&#8217;t finish the first part of the book with an AHA experience. The second part doesn&#8217;t really help either, as it just gives a lot closer information on different parts of the story as told by Ernest Backes, who was one of the early people at Clearstream, building the system.</p>

<p>The importance of this book lies in the details it gives in relation to the inner workings of Cedel and their Accounts System, including accounts onthe Cayment Islands of different banks and the growth of wealth of the Luxemburg royals.</p>

<p>Ernest Backes wants to do good with his revelations and shows that the Cedel System can be used for money laundry, but I can&#8217;t help but feel that the real problem comes from corrupt bankers that tunnel mafia money into the system in the first place. Cash has to be put in a bank at some point and that without turning up, which has nothing much to do with Cedel, which only does make it easer to transfer it arround, between banks and countries and hidden accounts.</p>

<p>With the help of unlisted Cedel Accounts, partly of unlisted Clients, that all turn up nowhere, you can pretty much transfer money into nowhere, at least unless somebody checks the Cedel accounts a lot deeper than done at the time of the writing of the book.</p>

<p>You also learn a little bit about the Loge P2, <a href="http://www.bilderberg.org/">Bilderberg</a> or the Freemasons or Nadhmi Auchi or Irving David Kott. All things you do not hear a lot about.</p>

<p>This is a book for those highly interested in this kind of material. It&#8217;s not easy to follow the story line and you need to be in an investigative mood, looking for small and juice details of the financial world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today is April 1st, so there are a lot of April Fool&#8217;s Jokes out there. Google for example has <a href="http://www.google.com/jobs/lunar_job.html">a luna job opening</a> for 2007. That is an April Fool&#8217;s joke. The question going on in lots of people&#8217;s heads is if <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">GMail</a>, Google&#8217;s potential new eMail client/service, is a joke. I have to now say that it doesn&#8217;t seem like it is. Several things point to that. For one, the HTML code of the startpage includes:</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; There is no secret html on this page &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>So ok, no secret HTML code then. On top of that, there is even a <a href="http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/gmail.html">press release about Gmail</a>, and I don&#8217;t think you want to send out a PR message to lots of people without it being for real. Then I found an article on heise in German (<a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/46204">here</a>) which says that they got it confirmed to be not a joke twice. And in response to heise readers saying that this is a heise joke again, a heise reporter said that this isn&#8217;t the case (<a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/foren/go.shtml?read=1&amp;amp;msg_id=5414437&amp;amp;forum_id=54872">source</a>).</p>

<p>All this points to this being true and having been delayed for April 1st on purpose to make everything think it is an April Fool&#8217;s joke, which again would be a good one ;) We&#8217;ll see later what happens.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: Based on a comment on <a href="http://www.ensight.org/archives/2004/04/01/other_great_april_fools_jokes_ongoing.html">Jeremy&#8217;s April Fools Jokes post</a>, this is real. It is getting clearer by the minute actually. The thing is that 1GB of Data doesn&#8217;t cost Google too much and who would actually be using up 1GB? Practically nobody, so that&#8217;s settled. And Google has to provide something. Why? Because this will be online only, no way to get it into an eMail client. Why? Because they need to place AdWords on it and they won&#8217;t be able to say &quot;ok, you will only get html eMails with AdWords in them, inline, in your own message&quot;. It has to be seperated. It&#8217;s also to close to something Google should do to be a joke. And Marketing wise, this is brilliant. Everybody knows now, everybody, and if only because they are thinking it is a joke. And tomorrow everybody will talk about it again when they find out it is not a joke.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just went to <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> and what do I see? A new look? Well not really a new look but a few enhancements of the old look. For one, you can now see all the services they have including Google Answers and Blogger, which is about time! Google could almost be called a portal. All they need to do is integrate <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">Orkut</a> and provide a login on the frontpage. I wonder if they will launch a new domain for that. Because Google is search, but what about portal.google.com? :) They also now have a big link to the <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/programs.html">Google Advertiser Programs</a> right on the front page now.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; They also now have <a href="http://www.google.com/domainpark/">DomainPark</a>. Do you have unused domains that have 750k Impressions per month? Park them with DomainPark and earn money ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s really starting to feel like Microsoft has not only understood the blogging thing, but also has a pretty interesting culture inside the corporation. One would imagine that starting a blog about recruitment for technical positions inside Microsoft would be a new move and would at least be known and checked out by the some VP or something similar. Seems like it wasn&#8217;t. This is obvious from <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jobsblog/archive/2004/03/27/100493.aspx">this post</a> from the &lt;i&gt;Technical Positions @ Microsoft&lt;/i&gt; blog, which also links to an interesting post on Robert Scoble&#8217;s blog Re a reply by a VP to one of his posts.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>There are two things at play here though. One is that Microsoft has a very open idea about blogging, even having <a href="http://www.ensight.org/archives/2004/03/24/blogging_isnt_conversational.html">Dave Winer speak about blogging</a> and they do allow their employees to blog freely, with the only limitation being that they can&#8217;t talk about anything that isn&#8217;t public within Microsoft yet if I remember correctly, which is really ok ;). So the HR Blog was really started by two people within the group and that&#8217;s that.</p>

<p>Second, this is just the way Microsoft seems to be doing things, being big but splitting everything up in small little teams that are pretty free to do what they need to do to achieve their goals. This sounds logical but is actually very hard to do within a company and you also need the right people to get it going.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; And it seems that Microsoft will launch Blogbot soon, a blog search engine. <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;amp;u=/pcworld/20040327/tc_pcworld/115416">Read the story on Yahoo!</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are some special instruments for interest risk control, and the ones discussed here are forward rate agreements (FRAs), interest rate futures and swaps. All these are derivatives, meaning that their price movements is derived from the movement in an underlying asset. FRAs are over-the-counter (OTC) deals while futures contracts are exchange-traded. The choice between OTC and exchange-traded derivates involves the decision of convenience against cost as OTCs can be customized to your liking, paying an extra for the privilege.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>FRAs are agreements between two parties, agreeing to a fixed exchange rate in a future period of time. They will then compensate each other if it is different from the actual. A FRA would be quoted as: &#8216;three against six months&#8217;, meaning a three month period starting in three months.</p>

<p>Example: I get a FRA from a bank three against six months of 8%. In three months the exchange rate is at 9%, meaning that the bank will pay me back the 1% to give me the 8%. All this does not involve any loan but is simply a contract to compensate for the difference. This deal only helps me make sure that my normal borrowing conditions do not fluctuate with interest rate changes.</p>

<p>In the above example I would then borrow for three months but would get the difference in interest rate at the beginning of the 3 months period, meaning that it has to be discounted as payment is made at the start of the period rather than at maturity. Normally the rate of interest specified in a FRA contract is the LIBOR rate.</p>

<p>{(LIBOR at settlement - Contract rate) x n/365 x Contract amount}   /  {1+ (LIBOR at settlement x n/365)}</p>

<p>The company will still pay the usual spread above LIBOR in its borrowing.</p>

<p>The advantages of FRAs are:
- You do not have to borrow, as this is independant of that action
- You can reverse your FRA by taking an equal an opposite one, called off-setting. They do not eliminate each other but do cancel each other out in terms of profit and loss.
- FRAs are tailored by banks.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Futures&lt;/b&gt; on interest rates and other things are another important option. They developed from forward trading, a contract to deliver a specific quantity of goods at a certain quality in the future at a certain date to a certain price. Futures are standardised forwards with specific size and settlement dates. Future contracts are not made directly but through a clearing house and your position in a futures contract you bought can be closed at once by selling the same. They are very liquid, also due to the clearing house, while forwards might not be sellable when you want to. Very few futures contracts actually reach maturity and 98%+ are closed out before settlement. If there are more futures or forwards in a market, this depends on how important and/or costly tailoring of these derivatives is. Foreign exchange trading is often done in OTC deals while interest rate trading is done in futures.</p>

<p>A little bit more on the &lt;i&gt;clearing house&lt;/i&gt; is in order. In simple, each party trading via the clearing house settles their account at the end of the day to start without a profit or loss at the start of the next day. When going into a deal you normally have to deposit an initial margin and after movements in the market, a &lt;i&gt;marking to market&lt;/i&gt; will happen which puts the account balances back in order by crediting and debiting so called &lt;i&gt;variation margins&lt;/i&gt;. While this requires daily payments from both buyer and seller, they do not need to know each other as everything goes via the clearing house. At delivery time the futures price must equal the real spot price of the underlying goods. Due to the marking to markt, the buyer now has the money to pay for the goods, which would be his early agreed on price plus or minus his gain or loss which was in relation to the spot rate. Due to the big amounts of money that are potentially at place here, while only really working with margin amounts, clearing houses might only work with members who&#8217;s credit ratings are checked. The margins are normally between 1% and 10% of the position taken.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Short term interest rate futures&lt;/b&gt; are normally priced as 100 minus the futures interest rate, meaning that 8% being the notional rate, a Eurodollar bond would be quoted as 92.00, shrinking to 91.00 if the interest rates on the Eurodollar bond rises to 9%. To make a profit on rising interest rates you need to sell a FRA now and buy it back later. The minimum price fluctuation is a tick, being 0.01%. Actual  cash flows in selling and buying FRAs is only the payment of margins.</p>

<p>There are also &lt;b&gt;long-term interest rate futures&lt;/b&gt;, based on long-term government bonds with 10 to 25 years maturity. With a future you pay to get delivery of something in x months. Futures prices are normallly linked to a given maturity and to a bond that is &#8216;cheapest to deliver&#8217; for the maturity. So a sale of a futures contract equals the salve of the underlying CTD bond in x months.</p>

<p>Page 64fff includes a worked example on heading a 4.500.000 EUR loan that needs to be taken out in the future.</p>

<p>&lt;B&gt;SWAPS&lt;/B&gt;</p>

<p>Oh the joy of swaps. There is a single-currency (previously interest rate) and cross-currency (previously currency) swaps. The idea is that two company for example take out a loan but pay each others loan and they both are better off. 80-90% of Eurobonds are part of &quot;bond plus swap&quot; packages. You borrow currencies you don&#8217;t need and swap them back to those that you need from somebody who has better access to them. You can also swap parts of portfolios of debt. Managing a SWAP-warehouse is a highly skilled taks, a very well-paid one, and allows for example a bank to mix and match different debt contracts in differnet SWAPs, in part or in total.</p>

<p>The general good idea of SWAPs is that it allows the buyer to have access to all markets and savings for the borrowers can comes from different reasons:
- there might be name recognition attached to the corporation in question or the other party, allowing for better access to debt
- there are differences in risk spreads and preferences in fixed and floating-rate debt for single-currency swaps.
- different markets of debt are independent</p>

<p>Following on page 72+ have an example of a single-currency swap and cross-currency swap. (You can find some examples <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=cross-currency+swap+example&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search">here</a>.)</p>

<p>All in all, swap contracts are complicated but they are being standardised and the minimum amounts needed for a profitable swap are going down as the market develops.</p>
