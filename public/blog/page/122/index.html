  <div class="entry-content"><p>Blogtalk 2.0 just took place in Vienna and Mena from <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a> held a keynote which she now <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/07/blogs_bandwidth.shtml">posted online</a>. Another very interesting summary comes <a href="http://nico.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=394">from Nico</a> though, who argues that her talk was really nothing more than a sales pitch because the Trotts, Mena and Ben, really were there only a few minutes or hours argueing that they were jet lagged or more. They should have been there longer when they chose to come which I can to agree with, partly. The problem here is that first Nico is competing with them directly, and even more importantly, because I don&#8217;t really believe this will cloud Nico&#8217;s judgements, the Trotts have an amazingly difficult schedule. They are wanted everywhere and I presume that they are currently trying to fulfil that need or want. They shouldn&#8217;t but they likely feel that they have to. they have grown a lot faster than was good for them, or rather, blogging has become so important and the are the Ubergods of it. That makes time management extremely hard. They now need to think strategy. Who are the really important ones? Where do we need to go? Need as in need! They want to be everywhere but they can&#8217;t.</p>

<p>But getting back to Nico&#8217;s post, it&#8217;s great! I do believe in eLearning/Knowledge management type blogs though, so am in the camp of the people that believe in it, which he believes that mostly talk among themselves. I&#8217;d take it a step further, in that eLearning/Knowledge management blogs only work when they are done for yourself, otherwise they just don&#8217;t. I do the OUBS Blog for myself, and am getting a lot of amazing feedback from it. But I still do it for myself. It is also nice to know that Macs are gaining traction in the connectors, multipliers, in the people that are getting other people to get stuff. Great! That&#8217;s that now though. Back to bed.</p>

Yahoo!&#8217;s premium service just got amazing. I am happy with GMail, and I did cancel my Oddpost account because I now longer really needed it but this rocks. Congrats to the Oddpost people and Yahoo!.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bloglines has turned one year a few days ago and today they <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/about/news#63">posted about</a> some new features. For one, they have a new design, which is actually really nice. At least from the first look. I am just not sure if it isn&#8217;t too cluttered to result in an easy reading experience. I seem to be diverted a little bit from reading, but that might be a novelty aspect. They also added their own blog hosting service, kind of, which allows you to have a simple blog hosted by them, nicely integrated into bloglines. For now, it isn&#8217;t something for me really and I am not sure if they are not spreading themselves a little bit thin with this. Now people will come tumbling down on them requesting some features for the blog. For now, I will stick with <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a> for blogging and <a href="http://www.furl.net/">Furl.net</a> as Rememberall. Bloglines of course will be my RSS reader of choice and even more happily so at this time.</p>

<p>A very nice item from their post is how much they have grown. They get an average of over 5 Million hits a day! That&#8217;s 150 Million hits a month! Congratulations people! Congratulations. I see you have added a sales team for advertising now. Let&#8217;s see how it goes :)</p>

Attention, this is not about generally expensing them but about first of all only expensing those of the higher executives and presuming at the same time that your stock price is non-volatile. You can read the article <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A29807-2004Jul5.html">here</a> or on Oldman&#8217;s Blog linked above.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Vodafone is one of the companies that I cited as one potential investment. Today I decided that they are in. Debt seems to be ok, with most of it (12 billion) are long term and 7 billion out more than 5 years. Free cash flow has been growing steadily from 2002 to 2004 from 2.4 to 5.2 to 8.5 billion pounds. This is more than enough to cover their debt. Free cash flow is expected at 7 billion in 2004 but I suspect less goodwill amortization. They are buying back high priced bonds replacing them with cheaper ones, improving their cost of captial. They are trading below book value and growing revenue steadily, over 30% in the last year. They are doing this by adding subscribers and increasing their non-voice revenue and ARPU in some countries. Yahoo! also cites their enterprise value to be above their market cap and I don&#8217;t really see them going down, so that&#8217;s a good chance going in. On top of that, only 6.7% of the shares are held by institutions, meaning that once the mobile bandwagon starts roling back in, they will jump back on. I do see an opportunity here and will add to my position.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the first time I am afraid of a book. I got the first two volumes of Neil Stephenson&#8217;s Baroque Cycle and boy those are big. The first one is 927 pages, and it&#8217;s a big book to start with! The second one is a bit smaller with &quot;only&quot; 832 pages. Why afraid? Knowing myself, knowing Neil Stephenson, I will likely find the book highly addictive and will not be able to stop reading until I am done. With a normal small book of 300-400 pages, that&#8217;s ok. But here, I am talking about reading 1759 pages in one go, with a bit of sleep of course. Boy am I happy that the third cycle isn&#8217;t out yet ;) I will likely have to let these wonders slip until the holiday end of this month.</p>
