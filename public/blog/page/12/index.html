  <div class="entry-content"><p>Even though people loved the video from my last post, back to writing for this one as my 3 month of sun is sleeping next to me.</p>

<p>I started my morning read with a <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/techblog/2007/11/facebook-ads---.html">short blog post</a> on the FT Blogs talking about the presentation being very Jobs like and that there will be no opt-out of the new social ads on Facebook. So what is really happening? TechCrunch actually has a good short summary about &quot;<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/06/changing-the-face-of-brand-advertising-online/">Changing the Face of Brand Advertising Online</a>&quot;:
&lt;ol&gt;</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Social Ads: Ads targeted at you based on your profile data.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Beacon: Widgets that Advertisers can put on their own site, probably linked to special Facebook Pages done by the advertiser ... if you as a user do anything with the widget or on the advertiser Facebook page, you quasi make them a friend, endorse them, ... . That ends up on your own news feed and your friends news feed :)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Insight: What kind of people are getting your ads and who are clicking.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
</code></pre>

<p>&lt;/ol&gt;
Social Ads was clear, so nothing new there. Insight isn&#8217;t so far fetched either. I mean just imagine the database they are building up there. How many people that like James Bond clicked on Ads for headache pills. Whatever you want to know, you can find out.</p>

<p>The interesting part is beacon, because that is what they are coining as being word-of-mouth advertising. The interesting thing is that through the widgets on advertiser sites, Facebook will also get more users. <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2007/11/06/facebook-launches-socialads/">Venture Beat puts it very well</a>:</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;Getting users comfortable with sharing e-commerce transactions sets up a virtuous cycle: (1) E-commerce stores can easily track the financial return of promoting Facebook, based on how many users share their purchase information, and how many sales are generated off clicks from friends reacting to it; and (2) the more financial rewarding Facebook is for e-commerce sites, the more those sites will attempt to promote it, say in promotions in confirmation emais. This, in turn, would lead to more users seeing the promotions, taking actions, and spurring still more activity from &lt;em&gt;their friends&lt;/em&gt; (and faster Facebook will grow.) That would be Facebookâ€™s hope.&lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>I am not sure yet what Beacon costs though, or what the Facebook page costs. <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2007/11/06/coke_want_to_be.html">Paul Kedrosky puts it well though</a>:</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;Notes from the near Facebook future:&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Courier&quot;&gt;Coca-Cola (Atlanta, Georgia) has requested to add you as a friend. Reply &#8216;a&#8217; to add, or &#8216;info&#8217; to get profile.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Oooh, I can&#8217;t wait. &lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>The problem in my mind is that this is people driven, and people interact best with people and if the company makes money with it, they want their fair share. But I do get the vicious circle bit.</p>

<p>As a final note, and to get all of this in perspective, check out the <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1787501">Facebook News Network</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you don&#8217;t know yet what <a href="http://seesmic.com">Seesmic</a> from <a href="http://loiclemeur.com">Loic</a> is about, check out his presentation at VON. (I am actually mentioned twice as oliver from germany and the greetings from germany at the end :))</p>

<p>&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;366&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/W1tFCQQrIh8&amp;rel=1&amp;border=0&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/W1tFCQQrIh8&amp;rel=1&amp;border=0&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; wmode=&quot;transparent&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;366&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</p>

<p>In short, Loic is trying to build a quasi Twitter for Video, but kind of making it into a real new age TV Platform. Next to letting everyone post a video, see those by their friends, there will be shows automatically generated by videos through voting mechanisms in channels. These might be edited summaries but I am still not shure how these will work in an automated manner. Next he is trying to build small Seesmic Cafes all over the world in major cities where people can come, hang out, and have some chats in front of the camera.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with the platform for a bit at the moment and I really do like it. The biggest problem is that I need more filters to get the content from my friends only, because otherwise videos become too much. But the fun thing is that this is a wonderful move on the mobile side. Just imagine getting the videos via the podcast client on your Nokia N95, and allowing you to easily answer from the N95. Now imagine something big happens somewhere. As I said ages ago, <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2006/01/12/press-no-longer-first-on-the-scene/">press is not longer going to be the first on the scene</a>, and with something like Seesmic, with a good Atom interface to post video, and something that pulls together channels based on user feedback, I can see the videos run on CNN now in my head.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Google has a nice little bookmarklet hidden away in the Goodies section of your Google Reader preferences. It adds a nice little link to your bookmarks bar called &quot;Next &gt;&gt;&quot;. What does it do? It opens the next unread item in your Google Reader, but not on the reader itself, but the site that the post came from, the permanent url. It&#8217;s a totally different way to use your Feed Reader and a very nice one at that. And once you are done, Google gives you a very nice page.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;P.S.: I am currently starting to wonder if they are putting ads in those &quot;Next&quot; items from time to time. I just ended up on a Dell page. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>John just <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/004031.php">posted</a> an interesting bit concerning Facebook and what he calls the social contract:</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;The social contract is not yet baked. By that, I mean the mainstream of society has not yet come to terms with the power/responsibility of our clickstream/digital social capital.This cannot be underestimated. AdWords came at the right time, in the right circumstances. It&#8217;s not like Bill Gross didn&#8217;t have it mostly right&#8230;Â &lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>This he takes as one of the reasons that Facebook might be on the right track, but they also might not have the perfect solution for leveraging the social graph in advertising. The social contract is something that sounded familiar but what I actually remembered was <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2003/05/05/112-managing-the-psychological-contract/">managing the psychological contract in managing people</a>:</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;This includes the expectations set forth by the above (normal work-) contracts as well as the wider picture, unspoken expectations. These might be taken for granted, only seen when they are broken or hard to discuss.&lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>This is exactly what he means with the social contract. We all read (or rather don&#8217;t) terms of service but what is important once it touches our personal lives, is that the social contract is fitting, that we are feeling we are gaining as much as we are giving. Problems with the social contract are only visible when they are broken really. Allowing for targeted ads based on my entire profile on Facebook might be seen by the users as breaking that contract as this is not what they (think they) signed up for.</p>

<p>This is very important in monetizing the social graph and we are putting a lot of effort on this here at <a href="https://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a>, taking on step at a time. At the moment a lot of it is still not visible, but only clearly enabled in the backend of the entire platform. We are coming from the lead generation market which is still a very unclear market where user data is traded left and right. Say yes to a terms of service (you did not read) once and your data is out of your hands. This is something we are working against in giving every user their own login to the platform. The thing is that this brings additional benefits, in that those users can build up their social graphs on the platform, willingly, to allow us to better find a local merchant for them. It is all part of what they signed up for, getting help by professional merchants in their region, strengthening the local market, getting personal connections to real people that help them with their very real problems.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a huge market, and a huge opportunity, trying to help people be more successful, both people looking for help, and those running and business and being shut out of the global advertising market. Through bundling of their buying power we become a global powerhouse that has lead generation as the underlying business model but an independent playing field to optimize the generation, management and usefulness of those leads for all parties involved. As a side effect, big and small publishers can suddenly make money from the local market. It&#8217;s an intricate system but it&#8217;s great working on something that you believe will improve the life of many.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lots of great news from the Amazon AWS team. First of all <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2007/10/amazon-s3-at-yo.html?cid=85711004">there is now</a> an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=379654011">SLA</a> for their service. This in itself is very cool indeed, not because I don&#8217;t trust their uptime and their will to be up and running, but it just ads a little bit of accountability to the mix. 99.9% uptime is roughly an hour of downtime per year by the way. Not bad.</p>

<p>The one that excited me even more, and I am happy to quiz one of their evangelists when he comes over to cologne next month, is from an <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,2190210,00.asp">eWeek article</a>:</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;Andy Jassy, senior vice president of Amazon Web Services, told the audience that the offering was currently working on static IP technology.&lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>Wow! Kick ass. I just really need one, and a way to manage which server gets that IP. Sure I could use some dyndns like service, or even <a href="http://www.neustarultraservices.biz/">Neustar Ultra Services</a> or something but having one unique IP that is up and that can be bound to a load balancer would be great. Add <a href="http://weoceo.weogeo.com/">WeoCeo</a> and I am set. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You need to maximize the value of your portfolio. That is very important. As OnVista was recently sold, with a nice premium, so I made a bit of money on that one. Having worked there, having built up what is now Ligatus, I knew that good things were bound to come out of it. But now they question comes how to maximize the free potential. As I have eBay and Nokia shares and have entrepreneurs and VCs tell me that they read this blog, I opted for the following: I hopped onto eBay and bought a nice Nokia N95.

<p>I have to admit that <a href="http://xing.com/">Xing</a> is yet one of the platforms I mostly <em>use</em>, not play with, <em>use</em>. Facebook is fun but I wouldn&#8217;t use it to look for contact info on somebody. It&#8217;s more about following the live of your friends and there might be better ways to do that. It&#8217;s a thought provoking little piece. Go read.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://hetzner.de/">Hetzner</a> Server I had up till now, also hosting the <a href="http://blog.ormigo.com/blog/">Ormigo Blog</a> and a few other things, was starting to be a bit expensive for the little work it did. I had their entry level dedicated server with 1GB Ram, two 160GB Disks, and theoretically unlimited bandwidth, for 49 EURs. It&#8217;s a great price if you need it.</p>

<p>Then <a href="http://teemow.com/">Timo</a> pointed me to <a href="http://xencon.net">x|encon</a> who are providing Xen based Virtual Servers. We have been running avirtualized infrastructure at Ormigo for some time, and I am currently looking into Xen based hosting systems (<a href="http://www.globalways.net/">Globalways.net</a> is a very good candidate). While x|encon does not really feature the high end systems we need, it did seem like a perfect match for what I was looking for. I actually started out with their smallest x|entry server with 48 MB of RAM but had to find out that with my limited time and unix skills, I didn&#8217;t managed to get both my Noserub and Blog installed on the server at the same time. It would just move up to load 6 and die on me, even though I opted for a very small mysql config and lighttpd running on a minimal debian install.</p>

<p>Because I want my stuff up and running, and I don&#8217;t have time to waste fully getting a tiny installation running with php5 and all, I now changed over to the smallest x|pro with 256MB ram, 2 CPUs, more storage and so on. At 19,99 EURs it is still not too expensive really and it has some nice benefits.</p>

<p>First of all, x|encon support rocks! They have been very forthcoming with my many requests for changes and questions. There were some hickups along the way, but that was me wanting to have the server now and they having a process of putting hosts online for your to work with via SSH but with limited connectivity before your bank account is cleared. The other thing that happened is that I did a hard reset of the server on a german holiday when they were moving the management interface. Ah well. I was a stressful customer.</p>

<p>What is very cool is the management interface itself. I can set bandwidth limits for the server, firewall rules, make a snapshot of the current system, reinitialize with a new OS, start and stop the server, boot it in the rescue system, have an internal network (and could take the server of the internet alltogether as a backend database server for example), &#8230; and I can connect to the console directly seeing my server boot. The upgrade process to the new server worked wonderfully, having 30 minutes of downtime because the higher resources ment that my &quot;server&quot; needed to be moved to a new machine. When it was back up, I just need a short break in rescue mode to scale the hard disk up to the new level and up I was, with the same installation, all my added packages, all my files, everything, &#8230; just more ram, cpu, harddisk, bandwidth, &#8230; very nice indeed.</p>

<p>This is really what I like about the virtualized infrastructure bit. You get very scalable, especially if you are willing to spend a bit more money than I did now.</p>

<p>Looking forward to playing a bit more with this stuff and I might actually have 6 servers at x|encon some time, doing different tasks, on and off the internet. Cool. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s a question now running around the net. The entire story started with Steve Ballmer saying the following: &lt;em&gt;I think these things [social networks] are going to have some legs, and yet thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a faddishness, a faddish nature about anything that basically appeals to younger people,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/technology/article2573297.ece">Mr Ballmer told Times Online yesterday</a>.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;And then there is also this part: &lt;em&gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å“There canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be any more deep technology in Facebook than what dozens of people could write in a couple of years. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s for sure,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;One thing is for sure. It polarizes people.

<p>&lt;p&gt;As you have now read those two posts, I will shoot over a few of my own comments. First of all, I am pretty sure that Steve Ballmer does understand social networking. He probably even understands that my own biggest social network is currently my address book in gmail, which is what I use to sync in my friends in new social networks within minutes. He also understands that Microsoft possibly needs a strategy to allow for swift investment in small startups (which they already have, sadly only pushing their own software at the same time, but that&#8217;s ok too) and investments in stuff like flickr, wordpress, skype or youtube, isn&#8217;t currently a high priority for Microsoft. Which of those services will in 5-10 years, add a few billions of free cash flow to Microsofts belt? Probably none of them. The same with social networking. That&#8217;s a feature, and the networks will be freed up eventually. Microsoft is looking for the next billion dollar thing, or for something that allows them to get closer to the billion dollar thing, and at the moment that is advertising, which includes networks, better management of advertisements, apis and so forth, because they will never have all the sites they need to run ads on anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Next up, is Facebook a fad? Nope, I don&#8217;t think so. I really do like it and it&#8217;s a nice service. If the money idea behind social networks is all about using social networks as a basis to better target ads, then all the big players will be desperate to create an open social network protocol they can tab into, because better targeting all the time is the only way this will really work.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;What the fad part is really about is that have my contacts in Xing exported, I have them imported into my GMail address book and whenever something opens up that I like, I can just sync that in and have many of my friends back. Especially the younger generation is a group of people that will very swiftly move to a new service, importing in their old friends. Facebook obviously will not die, but it is not certain that it will not be replaced by another &quot;fad&quot;, another hyped system that is the one to end them all.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So with the right set of features, with the right people to start with, you will probably be able to build the community that Facebook has, or rather a similar one that you might be able to monetize. That is something that MS might invest in, somebody that has the key drivers right and Ning might be more interesting down the line, at least from a business perspective, and from a Microsoft Platform view.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;The first one I&#8217;d like to briefly talk about is <a href="http://adscale.de/">AdScale</a> from Germany, which is really another copy cat, this time from <a href="http://adbrite.com/">AdBrite</a>. Having launched yesterday, it obviously still has very very little traffic on there, which is really the thing a network needs. But with one of their Investors, the European Founders Fund, has also invested in <a href="http://www.performance-media.de/Start.do">Performance Media</a>, I presume that to fill up rather quickly, but this depends on how the two systems can really interact, and with AdScale needing their code on the site they serve banners on, this might not work out as (possibly) planned. We will see.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The interface is really nice and I can easily set up my own site to become a member of their network. I will then choose a category and also choose keywords my site is about. These keywords can then be booked by advertisers. Having gone through the advertiser process first I was wondering if they were reading out the content of publishers live and serving banners similar to Google, which would be a huge undertaking, but that does not seem to be the case. At the same time, this makes the keywords a little bit a mute point, and the problem becomes that with each publisher choosing 5 keywords for any one placement (I presume to be able to give more than 1 placement), the keyword density will just be too low for efficient booking on the advertiser side.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The really nice thing is that you can give AdScale a fallback ad. So you could say that you want a CPM of 5 EURs on your blog, as an average over the banners they serve, and otherwise serve AdSense. Again, the problem is that either advertisers book with very high CPCs or you they need very good targeting, both not really being the case from my first looks. They do have MyVideo and others (many investments by EFF and Holtzbrinck Ventures I might add, both investors in AdScale) but based on the millions and millions of ads MyVideo serves, the current AdImpressions AdScale has point to the fact that they are just booked on few sites per default and can book on MyVideo if there are deals in the system that MyVideo wants (becoming very similar to Performance Media). It&#8217;s really the chicken and egg problem that advertising networks always have. And remember that we had advertising networks en masse in the first bubble and they slowly disappeared again.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There is one much more interesting startup that plays with an idea that has been in my head for a long time. I talked about it in my post from July entitled <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2007/07/03/we-need-a-small-little-change-to-banner-serving/">We need a small little change to banner serving</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The problem I am starting to see, especially for the smaller sites, is that they will have to choose one network, like AdJug to serve their ads. Then they are quasi locked in. I personally want the highest paying ad running and I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care where it is coming from. I can now go into my installation for OpenAds on my blog and choose to run AdSense ads or AdJug ads or like I set it now, Ormigo Ads (just testing my own stuff here, nothing for your to test, sorry) when people come from Germany. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all sub-optimal though. Because for any given page, AdJug might have the better ads, or we might or somebody else might or I might choose to just run AdSense, or even opt to have a CPL AdSense campaign shown when it really fits super well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we need is a VISA kind of market for advertising. In general I would love to do this as a start-up, but the thing is that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not really a start-up as it is not there to go public or get sold or anything else to make money of as an investor. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a separate entity that will make sure that the ground rules are clear. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This is where <a href="http://www.pubmatic.com/">PubMatic</a> comes in. What they do is a first step in the right direction, again a lock in, but the right direction. You give PubMatic your accounts for YPN, Blue Lithium, AdSense and others. They will then monitor how much money you make when displaying certain ads and certain pages and in the end, will start serving those ads that work best for any given page. Now that is cool! That&#8217;s the performance bit that I believe in, and that makes it easy for a publisher to always run the best ads. The thing we now still need is an open specification, a cloud of ads somewhere, where I can gather information of what runs best and choose it. That&#8217;s the next step. The thing is that the publisher business is 99% about profit, but they will have to take some strategic decisions soon in terms of which networks they work with and which client relationships they want for themselves, that&#8217;s for the big ones at least. But I do love a company addressing the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
