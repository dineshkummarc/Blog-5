  <div class="entry-content"><p>Buffet has written an article for the Washington Post talking about &lt;a title=&quot;Dividend Voodoo (washingtonpost.com)&quot; href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A13113-2003May19.html&quot;&gt;Dividend Voodoo&lt;/a&gt;. The idea of the US Senate is to make Dividends Tax free for a few years and then tax them again&#8230; in a sense, companies would almost have to pay dividends in that time and hold them the next year(s). He even argues that his company, Berkshire Hathaway could pay out $1.000.000.000 in dividends and then he would get $310.000.000. Tax free! No questions asked! By his calculation, this would move is tax rate from 30% to 3%. Fun ey? :) And on top of that Berkshire Hathaway would invest that money otherwise, and it&#8217;s not like he would invest all of it or something while Berkshire wouldn&#8217;t. Hence, it&#8217;s not really stimulating the economy much does it? And &lt;I&gt;Putting $1,000 in the pockets of 310,000 families with urgent needs is going to provide far more stimulus to the economy than putting the same $310 million in my pockets.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>The following also applies very well to Germany though: &quot;&lt;I&gt;When you listen to tax-cut rhetoric, remember that giving one class of taxpayer a &quot;break&quot; requires &#8211; now or down the line &#8211; that an equivalent burden be imposed on other parties. In other words, if I get a break, someone else pays. Government can&#8217;t deliver a free lunch to the country as a whole. It can, however, determine who pays for lunch. And last week the Senate handed the bill to the wrong party.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t fully agree, as you can for example lower taxes and put more burden on individuals for some things, something that would be a good thing in Germany, but all in all, it&#8217;s very much worth remembering.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Want to know who is a leader in innovation? Check out MIT&#8217;s Technology Review for their <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/scorecards/index.asp">TR Patent Scorecard 2003</a>. It will tell you how many patents which company registered, how close they work together with scientiest, how long they exploit their patents, &#8230; several different things that might be of interest for investment decision. It surprised me for example that Nokia&#8217;s rating in relation to closeness to universities is relatively low.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Want to know how Google&#8217;s PageRank really works? <a href="http://dbpubs.stanford.edu:8090/pub/1999-66">Here</a> you can find the 1999 paper about the system. Other interesting items include one on <a href="http://dbpubs.stanford.edu:8090/pub/2003-16">extrapolation</a>, something called <a href="http://dbpubs.stanford.edu:8090/pub/2003-17">BlockRank</a> and <a href="http://dbpubs.stanford.edu:8090/pub/2003-26">adaptive PageRank</a>, all items that are said to potentially enhance Google&#8217;s performance. It seems that the PageRank can currently take several days to calculate based on the several million pages in Google&#8217;s system and these new additions would help bring new features to Google (like your personal PageRank in relation to what you like) by bringing more speed. Or so <a href="http://www.golem.de/0305/25548.html">they said in this article</a> (german).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Checking my stats this morning I was wondering why I got so many hits from metafilter.com. Seems that somebody else, <a href="http://www.apu.ac.uk/appsci/psychol/staff/mpake.htm">Dr. Mike Pake</a> to be exact, also got his Google Blanket: &lt;a title=&quot;web-based question answering | Metafilter&quot; href=&quot;http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/25843?&quot;&gt;Ionaut: web-based question answering&lt;/a&gt;. And same as me, he felt very nice about it because he didn&#8217;t answer too many questions either. He also got a check from them though, same as myself again, for his contribution. I have to hand it to Google again (lots of agains here ;)), well done! And now you can also move the expense for the blankets and sending over to the marketing department ;) Thank you again!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rise and Fall by <a href="http://www.craigdavid.com/">Craig David</a> is featuring <a href="http://www.sting.com/">Sting</a> and boy is this song great! As of Sting&#8217;s site it is #2 spot in the UK single charts and while I am at it, I really like Sting&#8217;s idea (or his webmaster&#8217;s idea ;)) to give a daily MP3, be it live or recorded, for free, for the masses. This is a great way for older artists to introduce potential fans to their music. Now if you could link every MP3 to something like &quot;More like this &#8230;&quot; to a shop, then we would see a lot more free MP3s coming.</p>

<p>On a matter of wine, I am currently enjoying a 1999 bottle of Chateau Haut Bigord, Premieres Cotes de Blaye. It&#8217;s a very nice and round wine and I have to admit that a work collegue was right. The south afrikan wine we tried at work today (just one taste), was very very shallow against this french one. I swallowed the wine when I started writing this and I still have the taste of the wine moveing and changing in my mouth&#8230; wonderful.</p>

<p>Whoever invented wine&#8230; I thank you! Now please play that song again Zinf (my beloved Windows MP3 player)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That&#8217;s it. My old monitor sucked big time. It was a strain on the eyes and it was going nowhere. With general comfort with things that look good, an LCD monitor was appealing as it would take up less space &#8230; it&#8217;s good for the ego too ;) &quot;I big man! I LCD!&quot; ;) Well, now that I am a big man I am double happy because this baby kicks. Seriously. It&#8217;s an 18&quot; LCD at a great price with very good quality, thanks to Medion. <a href="http://www.medion.de/">Medion</a> is a huge PC company here that is growing like cracy supplying supermarkets and the like with hardware. They are going for the BIG number (capitals intended). They just stuck a deal with Best Buy to be part of their line up. The monitor I am using now will likely be a Belinea monitor, the company that now belongs to Medion. Of course it is named Microstar, doesn&#8217;t have the brand name attached to it, doesn&#8217;t have the testing, and doesn&#8217;t have some other sex appeal but it costs just 100 EURs more than a mid class 15&quot;!!! I am sitting here with a brilliant 1280x1024 resolution, K&amp;ouml;lsch next to me, listening to Royksopp&#8217;s night out and now I am posting to my blog &#8230; ok, that&#8217;s that, going to more interesting stuff now ;) &#8230; but get an LCD! It kicks! ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am currently playing with Overture and Google AdWords and bit and it&#8217;s very interesting I have to say. If you go to the <a href="http://www.content.overture.com/d/USm/adcenter/tools/index.jhtml">tools section at Overture</a> and go to the Term Suggestion Tool you can enter for example &quot;*&quot; to see how many search for that term. Interestingly enough&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seems like Microsoft is really having trouble with getting a foodhold in the market for their Smartphone. &lt;a title=&quot;CNET.com - News - Investor - News - Story&quot; href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/investor/news/newsitem/0-9900-1028-21210109-0.html&quot;&gt;T-Mobile just dropped Smartphone&lt;/a&gt; for a future phone. The article doesn&#8217;t make clear why it was dropped and if there was some pressure from other players, but the thing is that the mobile phone manufacturers really do not want a microsoft in their ranks. And in essence, Smartphone doesn&#8217;t have a chance against Symbian, at least not in the general market. What they are doing is focussing on the high ARPU market, where they do have a chance. MS has a long breath, and we will see how it pans out.</p>
