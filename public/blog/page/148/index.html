  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep, SERME in short. I just <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/000280.php">found it</a> via John Battelle&#8217;s Searchblog and I can only shake my head in amazement. The company having announced this is <a href="http://www.converseon.com/">Converseon</a> (what a name). As John, I&#8217;ll simply quote part of the press release:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;&quot;SERMA(C)&quot; Combines Innovative Content Management Techniques Together with Sophisticated Optimization Skills To Help Companies Better Manage Their Reputations and Brand Online</p>

<p>Converseon, a leading digital communications agency, today announced the global launch of the industry&#8217;s first search engine reputation management service (SERMA) designed specifically to help companies manage their corporate reputations in search engines. SERMA was created in response to the increasingly important role search engines have in determining a company&#8217;s reputation.</p>

<p>&quot;Search engines have become the primary resource for journalists and other constituents to gather information on a specific company,&quot; says Robert Key, President &amp; CEO of Converseon. &quot;Yet, while many companies may pay close attention to how the traditional media portrays them, most companies are completely unaware of what information is appearing when search engine users type in a company&#8217;s name.&quot; He points to examples like McDonald&#8217;s and Nike, where users typing in the companies&#8217; names on Google are exposed to highly negative information, including McSpotlight.org, a &quot;protest site,&quot; and the &quot;Boycott Nike Homepage.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>In general, they are monitoring search engines. I&#8217;d suggest <a href="http://www.googlealert.com/">Google Alert</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Heiko is calling everyone to blog at &lt;a title=&quot;We need more weblogs&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hebig.com/archives/001924.shtml&quot;&gt;&lt;I&gt;We need more weblogs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and with some of his posts I am continuously wondering if means it or if he just has a wonderful time making fun of something I didn&#8217;t read yet :)</p>

<p>One might say that we don&#8217;t really really need more content and we especially do not need to read more discussions, at least not in parallel. Then again I&#8217;d love to, which again is a bit sick if you think about it. But I think he means it, especially reading his post <a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/001926.shtml">&lt;i&gt;Beth Cox is sceptical&lt;/i&gt;</a> in which he quotes Beth as saying that she would be passing on the blogging trend for now as she doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s more than a little brand marketing. He responds by saying to just &quot;&lt;i&gt;keep on writing little articles for online publications that sell &quot;blogging&quot; as a &quot;trend&quot; years after it started. Keep on spending hours of updating your web site and money on keyword advertising. No, weblogs don&#8217;t have anything to do with it. Really.&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what I mean when I say that I wonder if I have to turn most of the things Heiko says around. So when is the next big blogger meeting to really get to know everyone? :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Why the hell is &lt;a title=&quot;Google Answers&quot; href=&quot;http://answers.google.com/answers/&quot;&gt;Google Answers&lt;/a&gt; not pushed more by Google? For those not in the know, Google Answers allows you to ask a question in case you do not find anything about it and then get it answered (potentially) for a small fee by a Google Researcher.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This is an amazing service and it seems to be logging about hundred questions a day, which might be the answer already. This just doesn&#8217;t pay millions of EURs. Even at an Average of 10 EURs per question, this would only bring in 30.000 EURs per month, which is just not enough. Still, the content that they are creating can have an amazing value. So I am wondering if this will be brought out more into the open at the Google IPO. There might be something very valuable in there at least.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I still have my Google Researcher ID to answer questions there but I have to admit that the people that they have online are just too good for me and the questions too complicated. You have to be really good at finding things and I mean really good. I think I answered three questions, getting my fare share of the fee. But after that it took too much time to monitor new questions. Still. I maintain what I always said, Google Answers is a great service and Google should push it a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently read that an <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;amp;item=2982373148">Orkut invitation is worth $11</a> (<a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/000267.php">read here</a>) and that already made me smile, until I received some feedback via my contact form:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;hey, long time reader of your blog. great to see you got into the whole orkut scene. do you have any invitations you could maybe send my way?</p>

<p>-chris
&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>First of all, maybe I do, maybe I don&#8217;t. If I do, why would I send &quot;invitations&quot; (see plural) his way? He only needs one doesn&#8217;t he? And then there is the problem that I don&#8217;t know who chris is. Sorry chris. He knows me, but I don&#8217;t know him&#8230; am I achieving stardom here? Will people start greeting me on the street soon? I think I am a few readers away from that but emm&#8230; continuing the original thread.</p>

<p>You (talking to Chris now) are (as a long time reader) obviously reading this, so please give me a bit more info on you, just in case I do have an invitation (watch singular) for Orkut. Not that I do. But in general this is a friends network so I invite friends, or people I at least consider to know a little tiny bit, either by knowing them personally or by reading their blog or something else.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to see what comes of all of this. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.nielsen-netratings.com/">Nielsen Netratings</a> has published a Report in Germany, saying that 94% of internet connected households do not take important decisions without usage of the Internet first. The most important starting point for 79% of them are search engines followed at 55% by the web sites of brands and producers. 46% are certain that they buying time is shortened by using the Internet.</p>

<p>All of this should really make people see how important the internet is for advertising. You might not be buying online, but you will surely get informed online.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;</p>

<h1>[&#8230;]</h1>

<h1>OBJECTIVE</h1>

<p>Your goal is to successfully traverse the five awesome worlds of IKEA before your patience runs out. On your first few tries this may seem like an impossible task, but with practice (and this IKEA Walkthrough!) you will soon be able to muster the sense of numb resignation necessary for victory.
[&#8230;]</p>

<p>=============================================================</p>

<h1>WORLD TWO: SHOWROOMS</h1>

<p>You start this world armed only with a UNIVERSAL FURNITURE-ASSEMBLY ALLEN WRENCH. This is the weakest weapon in IKEA: You will have to hit a person 16 times with it to kill them. So your primary goal in this level is to find more lethal means of dispatching your enemies.</p>

<p>As you enter the SHOWROOM, perform a rolling dodge to the left. Grab a free PAPER TAPE MEASURE and a handful of IKEA EMBLAZONED GOLF PENCILS from the kiosk near the entryway. The PENCILS serve quite well as ranged weapons, but it will take some time to master their use. Before venturing further in the world, stand at the kiosk and practice hurling GOLF PENCILS at patrons as they enter the SHOWROOM. Remember: Hitting the eyes does triple damage.</p>

<p>[&#8230;]</p>

<p>=============================================================</p>

<h1>WORLD FIVE: CHECKOUT</h1>

<p>This is it. The matchup between you and the final boss: IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad. But unlike traditional adventures, this ultimate showdown is not one of violence (much as, at this point, you&#8217;d like it to be), but rather a battle of will and endurance. If your PATIENCE is already running low, you are unlikely to finish this world. But this is what you&#8217;ll need to do to survive.</p>

<p>First push your cart into the CHECKOUT line. Now stand there and wait. Continue to wait. If the person in front of you moves forward, you should move forward as well. And then wait. The key to CHECKOUT &#8211; and I cannot emphasize this enough &#8211; is to wait.
&lt;/I&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There we have it. Orkut is closed for a few days pending some fixes. This is why it is only affiliated with Google and why they say Beta. :)</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;We&#8217;ve taken orkut.com  offline for a few days as we implement some improvements and upgrades suggested by users. Since orkut is in the very early stages of development, it&#8217;s likely to be up and down quite a bit during the coming months. None of the data you&#8217;ve entered will be deleted, and none of the connections you&#8217;ve made will be lost. And, if all goes well, you should see some significant improvements when we come back online.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll send an email once everything is ready and running again. Thanks for your feedback and for bearing with us as we work our way up the learning curve.</p>

<p>The orkut team
&lt;/I&gt; -&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;orkut - under construction&quot; href=&quot;http://www.orkut.com/construction.html&quot;&gt;orkut - under construction&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>I am pretty sure that by now, this is not Orkut&#8217;s side project, which he develops on his 20% &quot;do as you please&quot; time that Google has for everyone per week. But hey, it likely never was only that much for him and he likely didn&#8217;t do all this alone in the end. At least in the last few days/weeks pending launch, he will likely have had a bit more time. Remember that as he coded this at least partly at Google, it belongs to Google if Google asks for it.</p>

<p>And Orkut.com just rose too fast and probably had way too many hits by now to even hold out. My guess would be that they have far above 5 Million hits a day at the moment and they help up pretty well for that. Let&#8217;s see what happens when orkut.com is back up. :)</p>
