  <div class="entry-content"><p>I no longer have a girl friend. I now have a wife :) Feels very good actually and we had a great day so far, which was really just the legal part. Tomorrow we will have the church part of the deal with a lot more guests to celebrate with in the evening. Packing up a  few things, trying to relax. But life feels very good at the moment :)</p>

<p>We actually were married by Mr. Stommel, who is something of a famous guy at the registry office in cologne. It was a real joy and we had lots of laughs, which made the entire ceremony unforgettable. He had to make a joke about me being born in DÃ¼sseldorf (there is a bit of a fun war between dÃ¼sseldorf and cologne) to start with, of course topping it off with Avonia being born in the Iran (her father was there at the time). We came out of there feeling really good about all the marriage, later learning that he is married the fourth time and at the christening of his children he dresses them up for cologne karneval so they become good cologne citizen :) The guy is really fun and we thank him for a great ceremony. Oh, of course we&#8217;re still feeling great about the marriage. It&#8217;s a fun feeling.</p>

<p>We then had a quick drink outside which <a href="http://bornholz.typepad.com/">Ingmar</a> prepared (thank you!) and later lunch with all (only family and best &lt;I&gt;men/women/&#8230;&lt;/I&gt;) the people that attended. With all that finished, Avonia and me are now relaxing a bit and preparing for the church tomorrow, but more on that later. For now, I am looking at my new ring again and need to give Avonia a few more kisses. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That&#8217;s the question Jeremy <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/004940.html">asks</a> and I agree with him that it&#8217;s potentially peaking in the not too distant future. This would be a good thing though. When on-line shopping (to take his example) was all the rage, it was still in its infancy. After the hype died down it started to really get going without the problem of hype behind it.</p>

<p>I think Blogging still needs a few months to really get out of the lime light but the hype will die down in 2006, which is when it will be a standard term such as eMail and will become part of our life. More and more &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; people are starting to ask me about blogging. That&#8217;s pretty peaking I feel. But people are starting to get it, beyond the hype, just the general idea of talking publicly. So 2006 the hype will die down, and by 2009 blogging will be really big.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;
The project is showing it&#8217;s first fruits. Some time ago, two wonderful people came over to the <a href="http://www.gojou.com/">Gojou</a> offices (where I am currently sitting while planning the new enterprise) in search for some idea on blogging. They left the kid at home for the day and wanted to chat with <a href="http://bornholz.typepad.com/">Ingmar</a> and me about this new and interesting trend. The thing is though, that their story was a lot more interesting and was perfect for getting them to start their own blog. I am talking about Paula, Meike and Volker Zetsche. Together they became what can now be found at <a href="http://blog.diezetsches.de/">blog.diezetsches.de</a>. Their writing in German and &quot;Die Zetsches&quot; is the kind of the German Version of &quot;The Osbornes&quot; :) At least that was where the idea of the name came from.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes their blogging so interesting? Paula is just one and a half years of and just said Papa the first time. Meike has been a marketing manager for companies and starting with the baby, has become self-employed, consulting companies in marketing and sales. Volker has been a member of the top management of the VOK DAMS Group, the lead german agency for live-marketing. The interesting part is the has because he has just taken a sabbatical and now the entire family is going to Afrika for several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, for those who can&#8217;t read it, they are writing in german. But it will be an interesting tail and not only because I can relate so well having quite the same time as Volker. We had our first day in Freedom together, talking about blogs. :) The thing is that it&#8217;s hard to adapt to not working anymore, and it&#8217;s hard to leave your life for several months, and it&#8217;s hard to do all that with a small kid, and it&#8217;s hard to not fall in a hole. It will  be an interesting journey and the trip has already started. Looking forward to reading more from Meike and Volker. Teach Paula how to write please ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the kind of title that you will get (in German) when you go to <a href="http://www.dba.de/">dba.de</a>. That is if you don&#8217;t have JavaScript enabled, get a JavaScript alert (because it redirects to another domain) that you don&#8217;t agree too or just have fast eyes. Otherwise you will be redirected to Flydba.de, the main site of DBA, a german cheap airline. For all those that get redirected (also on the flydba.de mainpage by the way ;)), here is what you would otherwise see, or a part of it:</p>

<p>&lt;img src=&quot;http://thylmann.net/img/flydba.png&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>This is so amazingly clear search engine spam and it&#8217;s even badly done search engine spam!!! I mean they are using JavaScript to redirect to the real site. They could redirect based on user agent in the backend if they wanted to, which would be a lot less transparent to the average Joe out there. While this clearly is search engine spam I might even overlook this if it were done well because they are helping me find good stuff but &#8230; a) this is Google&#8217;s job to give me the right stuff and b) I hate having stupid words in my Google search and c) boy is that bad branding and d) it&#8217;s technologically and logically badly done!</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have expected that from somebody as big as DBA but they probably have just been tricked. I hope.</p>

Today I gave myself a little gift, it being an <a href="http://www.odysseygolf.com/en/product.aspx?pid=2ball.dfx&amp;amp;scroll=-92">Odyssey DFX 2-Ball Putter</a>, and boy is this one a beauty. It&#8217;s amazingly balanced, has a very nice feel, and the two white round shapes at the top help even the brainless to shove the ball in the right direction. :) And Odyssey has a very good text writer on their site. Check <a href="http://www.odysseygolf.com/en/beginning.aspx">The Beginning</a>:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Putting. It&#8217;s a game within a game. One with many challengers. But few masters. It&#8217;s where three feet can feel like three inches. It&#8217;s where muscle strength doesn&#8217;t matter. But mental strength does. And if you don&#8217;t control this game. This game controls you. Welcome to Odyssey. It&#8217;s time to even the score.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>Looking forward to trying this out on the next round.</p>

His german post is <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1897">here</a> and the Marketwatch article he links to is <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B78E696F2%2D6DBB%2D4E82%2DA971%2DD0CCE39DA048%7D&amp;amp;dist=rss&amp;amp;siteid=mktw">here</a>. Nice price. Actually fits to my view on <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/01/yahoo_to_acquir.html">what Six Apart might be worth</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;There is a great article on harvard business review entitled
<a href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/hbrsa/en/issue/0507/article/R0507L.jhtml?path=arc&amp;amp;pubDate=July%202005">Managing for Creativity</a>. It looks at SAS and how they manage creativity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This really got my back into my creativity and knowledge management courses, which also made the point several time that for creative people to flourish, you need creative tension (different people working together on a common goal and pushing themselves upwards), abrasion (rubbing of on others) and requisite variety (variety in your people). To help that you should really reach out and talk to your customers and use them to get new ideas. The ideas are everywhere, they just need to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, creative people want to do good work, and if things hinder them doing that, they will leave. That&#8217;s also why Tom Peters term for a manager, a barrier removal professional, is really true and important to keep in your head.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Another important item is honesty and not making people feel as you are greedy or just using them. All this is very specific to a person, as each person is different. So you need to learn their traits inside out and give them what they want. SAS send their developers to conferences and training a lot so they get new information and knowledge, and, something that fell through the cracks a bit in the article, to get them connected to their community of practice. By now, we know that creativity, and knowledge creation works in interdisciplinary teams but also within your community of practice which extends far beyond the company.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The importance of people is why I think the term Human Resource Manager is flawed and outdated. People aren&#8217;t resources that are used up but assets that are leveraged. The name should be Human Resource Leverager. As SAS sees, outsourcing is a bad idea in this case, as you are taking away your option to leverage those assets.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Another important point coming out of the article, is that it&#8217;s not about what you push into something but what comes out at the other end. As an example, an employee should be able to see his kid at his first day at school. Do you think somebody will be more productive not being able to do that? If people are really motivated, and creative people are if they feel they can be creative, then they will pull their weight, even if they take a break to play tennis in the middle of the day!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
On top of that, you need to respect your boss and he needs to really understand what you are doing. So Semco&#8217;s idea of letting employees choose their boss can be a very good one if handled correctly. Some very good points in the article and some people out there should really get their head around. If this is the age of the creatives, than managing better changes fast.
&lt;/p&gt;</p>
