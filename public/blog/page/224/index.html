  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, it seems that I will have to get up at 4 am today to get my character walking the longer route. I have to be at the destination tomorrow at 12 and this route will give me 4x60 points extra which would be a good thing I think.</p>

<p>I find it amazing though that I even think about getting up in the middle of the night just to move a character around :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This Nokia Game stuff is interesting. My character, Alpha, is currently walking to the cinema. About 5-6 hours ago I choose that way and it was said to be 6 hours. I just logged in to the game and Alpha is still walking ;) I&#8217;ll have to log in again later. This is getting fun. Actually it is totally stupid but what I like is that you are playing for several weeks, can just forget it for a few hours but never really leave the game. That makes it interesting enough. Cool concept.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A well, that was actually nice. I just uninstalled IE6 and played the first game again. The story in general is interesting and the first game was about a system of 4x4 loud speakers, you click a speaker, it gives a ring tone, you click another one it also gives one and if they match you get points and they explode and are gone. Per try you get points deducted. It&#8217;s not the most challenging game. The question now is if I want to get up at 6 am tomorrow morning to help some skaters excape somewhere&#8230; hmm&#8230; 6am &#8230; hmm&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, so I am playing Nokia Game (http://www.nokiagame.com). It just started, I already got called, received several sms and have a few e-mails. I know where to start. Now I find out that you need I.E. 4.5+ but IE6 is not supported. Stupid. Stupid! STUPIIIIID! Now I need to find out how I can install several IE versions next to each other. I have 6 already &#8230; downgrading windows. Interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On saturday morning, around 7:30, a time I very rarely get up, I packed my things in the car and started my journey to Utrecht. It&#8217;s actually rather close, just taking me a bit over 2 hours and everything was easy to find. Having arrived at  place we continued our way to Amsterdam to help Hans move to his new appartment, as if I didn&#8217;t have enough moving action already. This is also where I met Mark Hall for the first time in real life, just having talked via e-mail a few days ago. He is really a very nice guy and as he is probably reading this (soon, once he has his account ;)) &#8230; nice to have met in you in real life Mark! ;)</p>

<p>We were 6 people and that made the move go very painlessly. I actually watched out the entire time that I do not twist my ankle, which happens a lot, and it didn&#8217;t, until of course we were done and I was moving down the stairs. Amazing. Thankfully nothing major happened and the foot was feeling ok again soon after. Some of us then waited inside a bar until Hans and a friend brought back the small truck. Looking back, we shouldn&#8217;t have drunk beer at 1300 without having really eaten something. Not that we were drunk but the constant small quantities of beer might have had a bad effect on our fitness the next day.</p>

<p>Anyway. We ate a little bit in a cafe and started talking. The talks were flowing through a lot of subjects far to numerous to be written down here but for me it was an amazingly nice thing to once again talk with very technology interested people. I just didn&#8217;t have that a lot in recent times having move to Cologne. I need to change that a bit here. :)</p>

<p>We then decided to go to Amsterdam to the Milkway, a club, because they had some DJs from Ninjaclub (or a similar sounding label). We thought we&#8217;d also go eat out in Amsterdam but on our way we went past a very nice Indian Restaurant and then ate there. It was really wonderful. I had some spicy chicken and it was just right. I mean it was hot, but not so hot that you only feel hot after a little while. It seemed that it was perfect for me.</p>

<p>Then we went on to Amsterdam and entered Milkway. The first DJ was ok but then came the main act, if you can say so. Two guys working with 4 turntables and sequencer/sampler. In short, they rocked. The vibe was amazing and you could see them work and saw the musician in them. With the first guy you just had somebody putting on music and doing some strange stuff with it. But the others seemed to be composing. Really cool. I was the one driving that night and didn&#8217;t drink anything but listening to them was enough of a stimuli. I must look for a few more clubs in Cologne to find something similar.</p>

<p>Around 3 am we left and Thijs and me headed back to Utrecht and went right to bed. About 10 to 11 he came in and said we were leaving again for Haarlem (where Hans lives now) in 10 minutes&#8230; Thankfully I was already awake and he told me last night that this is how we were handling it. It was a rough getting up but then, after a short delay, we were already out of the door and in the car. Sadly meeting the others for the real Lucid Lunch meeting was proving to be a bit harder than we thought and it took until 14:00 until all were there. We all wanted something real to eat and found that in a cafe that was selling burgers and stuff. They were actually very good though I still think the idea of an egg on a burger is weird :)</p>

<p>We started to get our scheduled discussion going in there. &quot;Metaphors in Technology&quot;. Interesting subject really. As a simpler example, is it good that in our computer the Desktop is called or referred to as the Desktop? Would it have been better to call it Poopeldu because we would not have been restraint by what we expect from a Desktop? Or might it really help in terms of the learning curve? What should we look out for when choosing a metaphor? When choose something we know and when create something new? Where are the limits? Hans already mentioned and Mark then explained further the Places, People, Thing metaphor system which was about trying to get the metaphor idea as far as possible. For example for our meeting you would go into a room (on your computer, something referred to as a room). There you would find all people attending and applications that you need for that meeting. I think you get the point. It was a very interesting discussion and I have to say that it went really well in terms of getting 7 people to all contribute their views and manage to meet somewhere even if not totally agreeing. I am looking forward to the next meeting already.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&quot;It has long been known&#8230;&quot;
I didn&#8217;t look up the original references</p>

<p>&quot;A definite trend is evident&#8230;&quot;
This data is practically meaningless</p>

<p>&quot;Of great theoretical and practical importance&#8230;&quot;
Interesting to me</p>

<p>&quot;Three of the samples were chosen for detailed study&#8230;&quot;
The results of the others didn&#8217;t make any sense</p>

<p>&quot;Typical results are shown&#8230;&quot;
The best results are shown</p>

<p>&quot;The most reliable results are those obtained by Jones&#8230;&quot;
He was my graduate assistant</p>

<p>&quot;It is believed that&#8230;&quot;
I think</p>

<p>&quot;It is generally believed that&#8230;&quot;
A couple of other guys think so, too</p>

<p>&quot;It is clear that much additional work will be required before a complete understanding of the phenomenon occurs&#8230;&quot;
I don&#8217;t understand it</p>

<p>&quot;Correct within an order of magnitude&#8230;&quot;
Wrong</p>

<p>&quot;It is hoped that this study will stimulate further investigation in this field&#8230; &quot;
This is a lousy paper, but so are all the others on this miserable topic</p>

<p>&quot;A careful analysis of obtainable data&#8230;&quot;
Three pages of notes were obliterated when I knocked over my beer</p>

<p>&quot;Reasonable order of magnitude&#8230;&quot;
Wild guess</p>

<p>&quot;Non-trivial problem&#8230;&quot;
It doesn&#8217;t work, but if we throw enough money at it, something&#8217;s bound to happen</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fast Company has published their new list of leaders in 2002. Check it <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/online/52/wf_intro.html">here</a>. It is really an interesting read. I loved the story about <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/online/52/quinn.html">Feargal Quinn</a>. The one about Michael J. Fox and his Parkinson&#8217;s foundation is amazing too. These are the only ones I read so far but I will read every one of them&#8230; Again a sign that Fast Company can produce very insightful articles and interviews more often that some others.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, it turns out that yesterday night I talked in my sleep. The interesting thing is what I said (translated from german):</p>

<p>Me: It&#8217;s Green. It&#8217;s green&#8230;. green it is.
Avonia: Oliver?
Me: Green!</p>

<p>&#8230;</p>

<p>Hmmm&#8230; Now she really wondered what I was talking about that night and I have no clue whatsoever. But it brought me thinking again about the fact that you can remember all your dreams if you want to. All you have to do is all day, focus on stuff that is right, like how the light shines in the room, how the clock is ticking, where the TV is, how the pictures are hanging, how the world looks, &#8230; anything. Then when you dream you can suddenly find things that are just not right and the cool thing there is that after some time you can notice that you are dreaming and can say &quot;Cool, let&#8217;s see how flying works&quot;. This would really rock. The problem I see is that you will not have real dreams anymore. Or at least the danger is there that you will not have dreams you don&#8217;t fully remember and as humans are trying to work through the emotional problems they had/have in their dreams that might just be a bit dangerous I think. So I will leave it at wondering what was green :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw this on TV yesterday and it rocks. The show is full of horn players, dancers, percussionists, singers, very wild and funny and upbeat. Now I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004WH76/bizkiffer-20/">the CD</a> and the DVD on Amazon. Sadly it&#8217;s not available here it seems, I need to look around. There are some samples of it but I think I will need to get the DVD. I mailed amazon.de to see if I can get it here somehow.</p>

<p>Sadly the samples do not have the amazing percussion scenes.</p>
