  <div class="entry-content"><p>Checking out the GOOG insider transactions list gives you an interesting list of who is selling how much.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was at Les Blogs this month I talked a bit with Salim Ismail from PubSub about the now launched <a href="http://www.structuredblogging.org/">StructuredBlogging</a> initiative and mentioned to him that this would be playing really well with an idea we are currently following with <a href="http://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a>. Now I see Jeff Clavier (didn&#8217;t manage to talk to him at Les Blogs, damn) posted <a href="http://blog.softtechvc.com/2005/12/syndicate_confe.html">about StructuredBlogging</a>. This in itself isn&#8217;t too interesting, as I already mentioned that I believe in the general idea in my <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/12/market_predicti.html">predictions for 2006</a>, but &#8230; Read this part:</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;Mike Arrington from TechCrunch fame, and also Edgeio - the stealth project he and Keith Teare have been working on - briefly mentioned that supporting a forthcoming Classifieds micro-format will be part of the roadmap of the company. I should use this occasion to disclose that I am also involved in Edgeio - more on all this later.&lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>This seems to be very close to what I talked about with Salim Ismail. In general what StructuredBlogging already hints at, is the option to describe divers things in a standard way and this can be applied to the classifieds market. If you then add something like the corporate structure that VISA is using, being open about performance, letting everyone add stuff, everyone code how they get their stuff out (e.g. my stuff first) and handle the billing on a lead basis (to remove the click fraud problem), then this gets amazingly interesting. <a href="http://www.henninglange.com/">Henning</a> and me did already set up a very big performance marketing system in Germany in our previous positions, outbidding Google in several places, so we know what the publishers really are looking for and it is not all about money. An open service will add a whole new competitive layer that Google can&#8217;t possibly match, meaning that you don&#8217;t even have to have the best performance, just one that is close enough. We know that lots of companies and publishers out there will be amazingly interested in something like this. They all want an AdSense but they all don&#8217;t quite know how to build it and it actually doesn&#8217;t make sense for them to build it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.trachtenberg.com/blog/2005/12/12/how-to-commoditize-away-googles-advertising-revenues/">Adam Trachtenberg gives a similar hint</a> by just thinking out loud about web services for classifieds pricing structures. The entire system is to a large part a challenge in corporate structure, especially as you need something above and beyond a technological edge. VISA is in my mind a very good example of such a structure. In the end it is about being open and about not being seen as the one making all the profit. Just enable others to make a profit, and make a tiny amount in processing fees. It will create a real market where only those that pay well and perform well will be able to survive. Tough market, but fair market, and one we believe <a href="http://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a> can survive and prosper in, which is why am starting to think out loud about this. We named the system AdCloud for now. :)</p>

<p>My fellow <a href="http://web.corante.com/">Corante Web Hub</a> member Alex Banrett has some more <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/archive/2005/12/14/503942.aspx">thoughts on StructuredBlogging</a> tying it in with <a href="http://www.attentiontrust.org/">AttentionTrust</a>. Pete <a href="http://mashable.com/2005/12/14/structured-blogging/">adds more thoughts of his own</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The stuff us software people do is really really simple if you look at it. I mean we are not shipping any physical stuff. Or build physical stuff. Just think about the people that build high speed trains, power stations, aircraft carriers, &#8230; . Ok, you get the idea. But this is all put in a totally new perspective when a software guy gets into the real world shipping business and cuts his packaging time down from 3 minutes to 35 seconds with fun software and hardware. Great stuff at <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HowToShipAnything.html">How to Ship Anything</a> by Joel on Software.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;The gang of the <a href="http://web.corante.com/">Corante Web Hub</a> has decided that we&#8217;ll do our own predictions for 2006 and that Ken will then aggregate of all of those into a nice summary post. So there we go, what are my predictions for 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;1. The Google Bubble will Burst&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is immensely overvalued and that valuation will need to come down. I might be out on a limb here and I do know that they still have a lot of growth in them, but the problem is that they are slowly but surely becoming the bad guy, and have already sold lots of stock for a reason. They are doing small little things to keep revenue and profits growing but it will be hard. They might monetize Google News to get more cash and that will bring some problems with publishers. They are increasing the number of ads on a page, which gets a bit much. They might have to close down Google Print if the lawsuits are successful, even though I doubt that. There will soon be a lot more competition on the big publisher sites for their ad space and a lot of growth comes from that extended network. Lots of things are really pointing in the direction that their growth will have to slow down soon and then the stock is bound to fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Lead Based Models will gain importance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead based advertising models are already coming into the lime light but this trend will increase, with <a href="http://www.root.com/">Root Markets</a> being one that will try to really push that market to new levels. The new company I am building up here in Germany is working in that market and I am doing this for a reason. The model just makes sense for advertisers who get more control, and who are more inclined to advertise on blogs as they are not doing it for the branding but for the clear demand that has been generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Blogging will loose the hype&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will stop seeing reports that company x now does this blog thing. It will stop to be news and it will become something of a part of the marketing/media mix. This will when the growth will really take of, when not everything will be called blogging for the heck of it. The general idea of being open in your communication, allowing feedback, starting conversations, posts being displayed with newest first, attracting niches, &#8230; all this will become very important. Something that will start to be hyped will be moblogging, pushed partly by Nokia, and this will provide interesting opportunities for the press as they will always have fresh pictures from any crime scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. 3G will become accepted&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US this is already starting but the same thing will happen here in Europe. The reason will be simple. UMTS Networks in Europe, the 3G standard here, have now been built out and the data is available. This is resulting in that bandwidth being available for sale and the first data flatrates are appearing. That means that you can be always and everywhere online for 25 EURs when Base started their UMTS flatrate next year. Nobody will care if it is 3G, but it will just be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. FON will grow big&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through his interesting use of bloggers in the advisory boards in different countries, <a href="http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/">Martin Versavsky</a> will grow <a href="http://www.fon.com/">FON</a> into the biggest WiFi network out there. By far. There will be lots of Foneros as he calls them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Structured Blogging will loose the blogging term&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;<a href="http://www.structuredblogging.org/">Structured Blogging</a> will loose the blogging part and merge more into a first implementation of the semantic web and give us more structure with a lot more schemas being developed on top of the basic idea. Based on this we will see some new level of mash ups that just take data and do fun stuff with that data based on the additional information available. It will lead the way to other schemas around other subjects, creating open data markets where added value is generated through the work done with that content, not the content itself. In a sense the semantic web will start building up quite a bit of hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Mashups will go corporate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mashups are a fun thing, they are at the moment mostly free services that make money with AdSense, but the general idea of connecting things together to great something of real value, of more value than the simple sum of the parts, will start moving into the corporate and for profit space. There will be more Web Services that are not free, with small payments needed on a per request basis. Some very cool stuff will be built that is really a collection of the right Web Services with a good service layer above it that provides something that would have been very costly to do previously.&lt;/p&gt;

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The blogosphere is <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002116.php">lighting</a> <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/alexa_turned_in.php">up</a> with the news that <a href="http://alexa.com/">Alexa</a>, owned by <a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon</a> has opened up their search and statistics data. John says they have about 5 billion documents stored in 100 terabytes and this entire thing is now available via the good old AWS, the Amazon Web Service. The <a href="http://websearch.alexa.com/welcome.html;jsessionid=B3D5C370A5954C858D2E705B027723E3">Alexa Web Search Platform</a>  has put together an example at <a href="http://photo.alexa.com/">photo.alexa.com</a> in which you can for example search for photos made with the Canon EOS 350D (or RebelXT how it is called in the US). As shown in the price guide, you pay:
&lt;ul&gt;</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1 per cpu hour&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1 per GB/year of user storage&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1 per 50 GB processed&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1 per GB uploaded/downloaded&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1 for every 4000 user-published web service requests&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
</code></pre>

I really need to check back with this $1 per GB/year again. That part alone is interesting enough. You can also use the system to publish your own search engine on their servers. All this stuff is getting mighty interesting and Amazon is starting to become an amazingly interesting company.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now this is an interesting twist. <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002099.php">John links</a> to <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/12/08/HNmssearchengine_1.html">a story</a> in which Bill Gates is quoted as saying that Microsoft will look at giving back some of the revenues generated through its search engine to users. We had, in the previous bubble, the model to get paid to look at ads, and it failed. This is different though. Microsoft will pay for traffic of good intent as John put it. It pays people to ask their questions, which is an interesting model to say the least and it might be that one thing that makes Microsoft get a kick start. Of course it remains to be seen what they really do, but Gates brought up a whole new thing now, and shows again that they can put their war chest towards gaining market share if they want to.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is starting to really circle wide. The Register is now <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/08/lesblogs_nice_call/">reporting about it</a> and I&#8217;d like to give a few words about what happened.</p>

<p>First of all, it is not so bad. Really. Mena did <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/about/corner/2005/12/mena_trott_impl.html">her talk</a> and it was around a touchy subject. The thing is that sometimes discussions on blogs can get out of hand. Ben and Mena have now <a href="http://benmetcalfe.com/blog/index.php/2005/12/07/les-blogs-me-mena/">written</a> <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/about/corner/2005/12/words_you_shoul.html">more</a> about it. The part which gets all the interest is the time Mena said Ben acted like an asshole the entire first day on the conference in the backchannel. Ben of course doesn&#8217;t think he was. He was harsh though but that might just be how he is.</p>

<p>The thing is that this is a problem of such conferences as well as the blogging world, or even the world, as a whole. We come together in such conferences believing we are all friends and in a sense we are. If you really think about it though, we are just a pretty big community of practice that gives us a common base to rest our relationships on. We are still very different and we do not really know each other. Calling each other friends might be going a bit overboard, even though it was a really friendly environment and everybody was connecting on a personal level and opening up. The problem is that this doesn&#8217;t yet enable us to know how we all talk and what the deeper meaning of our words is. We just have a good level of trust towards each other.</p>

<p>In the blogging world this is similar, because everybody can talk, and with the growth of the ecosystem, the diversity grows and suddenly the blogging world isn&#8217;t a community of practice in itself. It doesn&#8217;t have one base to rest its conversations upon. This makes the problem a bigger one because we will have a hard time to interpret what different people say in the right way. In your real inner friends circle, you filter out people that you do not really like, but within this circle of friends, people can be a lot harsher towards each other because we know that that one guy just talks like this. We can interpret his words in the right way. This cannot happen in the blogging world because as Cluetrain said, it&#8217;s about the conversation, but that conversation is not normalized. The diversity is immense. Hence we will have problems with finding out which people we like and which people we don&#8217;t like. We will have problems finding out which people talk in which ways when saying the same thing.</p>

<p>The only thing that I can think of to help in this system is to deeply integrate social networking. It&#8217;s the idea of a friend of a friend being my friend. To a large part that is true and it especially allows me to give the other person some slack. If a friend says that the other guy is good, then we should trust that to some extent.</p>

<p>This is what should have happened at Les Blogs. dotBen, how Ben called himself, wasn&#8217;t being rude in the chat, because it is the way he expresses himself. And we could have known that because he was at Les Blogs, he is a generally nice guy. The conference was getting big enough though that you couldn&#8217;t be sure of that, because there could be any number of people in there that were an asshole. Had he called himself with his full name in the back channel, this wouldn&#8217;t have happened most likely and that&#8217;s a big part of what Mena touched upon. We need to make sure that we know who is blogging what, and we need to make sure that we know that person&#8217;s connections. I could for example envision a system where when I look at a blog, and can see the route to that person in LinkedIn and OpenBC from me to them. This would allow me to treat them in the right way, to be sure that the common language from any of my communities of practices will be understood.</p>

<p>So thanks a lot for Mena to have  the courage to bring it up, and sorry to have been there when she snapped a bit, which shouldn&#8217;t have happened but (!) which really brought the conversation to the right level. Thanks to Ben for standing up when he was asked to. I bow my head to both of you.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rumors <a href="http://www.agenturblog.de/archives/2005/12/kauft-yahoo-delicious.php">are coming</a> in that Yahoo! will be buying del.icio.us today for $30-40 Million.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/yahoo.html">Check</a>. One more cool service for Yahoo!.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Update 2:&lt;/strong&gt; By now I already heard numbers lower than $30 million, going as low as $17 million, which would still be a good number.
