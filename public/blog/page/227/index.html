<p>TMF2Aruba talking about his experience teaching 8th graders yesterday (that&#8217;s his other job):
http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=15732643</p>

<p>Very good post here about the feeling to be an American at the moment:
http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=15733644</p>

<p>&quot;Old Cold War strategies with armies marching off to war to fight some highly organized and easily defined &quot;bad guys&quot; are now sadly outdated.&quot;
http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=15733154</p>

<p>A very good analogy from desert storm about people cheering:
http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=15733218</p>

<p>An open letter to Osama bin Laden:
&quot;Dear Osama bin Laden:
Congratulations. You&#8217;ve done what our best diplomacy efforts have not been able to do. You&#8217;ve united the world. You&#8217;ve allowed the world to put aside its differences and instead made every terrorist group, and anyone helping these groups, enemy number one. &#8230;&quot;

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Reuters published a story about <a href="http://us.news2.yimg.com/f/42/31/7m/dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010912/ts/attack_palestinian_reaction_dc_1.html">Arafat donating blood</a>.</p>

<p>It includes some quotes from Palestinians. Here is one I think is important.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;&#8220;We the Palestinians are human beings and we don&#8217;t celebrate when others are mourning,&#8217; 42-year-old housewife Amal Qassem told Reuters from Bethlehem.</p>

<p>&#8220;Although Israel hits us every day with American Apache helicopters and uses American weapons to kill our people, we send our condolences to the families of the victims,&#8217; she said.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can&#8217;t really explain the feelings, it&#8217;s weird. It seems to come in waves. I did get practially nothing done today, which I would not have expected from me I have to say. All this is so hard to understand and one of the best ways to try to understand, for me, was reading the eye witness accounts on BBC&#8217;s homepage.</p>

<p>I am very thankful to know that none of my direct family or friends have been killed in the disaster.</p>

<p>Here is the URL and I added some selected comments below.</p>

<p>http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/talking_point/newsid_1537000/1537530.stm</p>

<p>There are both positive and very sad messages.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;A friend of mine was at work on Long Island. A woman who works with him got a call from her husband who works on the top floor of one of the twin towers. He called to say good-bye. He knew he was not going to get out. The woman lost it.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;She had two cousins on the 102nd floor. They made it out. My entire office made it out. Michele from my office was down getting coffee and saw the second plane hit the building. She ran to the nearest exit and got on the ferry to New Jersey. She made it out safe. &lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;Like the naive onlooker I ran closer to see what I thought was an horrific accident as I saw one of the trade centre buildings burning from the upper floors. Thousands of people stood in disbelief as they saw the pinnacle of American Capitalism burn before their eyes.</p>

<p>It was not till I saw more than 6 people jump to their deaths that I knew this was no picture to photograph or to remember.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;One cop said he could see through to the other side when the wind was strong enough to blow the smoke over. His exact phrase was &quot;if you have a strong arm you can throw a baseball over the world trade center&quot;.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;People are still in shock, but New Yorkers are very proud of their city. &lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Apart from the immediate aftermath, the most amazing thing is that there was very little panic in the streets away from the immediate area. People are calmly trying to get home to their loved ones and are being patient and cooperative despite the difficulties of moving around. It just serves to demonstrate how resilient the spirit of the people of this great city are. New York City will bounce back from this outrage. It will not break us&#8230; &lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;It&#8217;s at moments like these that you feel the most helpless, the most human. &lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>Trying to think not about the many people dead but about the many many more people helping and trying to smile at the thought of the power of good in this world. We will succeed. We will grow. We will continue to do our best to bring everyone on the right path.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ll take this from a TMF discussion board:</p>

<p>http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=15723559</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;Pray. Pray hard. Please.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve already been in tears. I pray for all of heaven to descend on these sites and that clarity cut through the confusion. I pray that those who have survived make their way to safety. I pray that peace comes to those close to those that have been made victims. I pray for those responsible that they see how wrong they are and stop this insanity. I pray that any response be one of justice and not of retribution. I pray for forgiveness that my first reaction was one of anger. I pray that this is over now. I am not afraid to ask you all to join me.</p>

<ul>
<li>John Scofield &lt;/I&gt;</li>
</ul>


<p>I might not be very religious but this is very well put.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll add this from one of the people I value very highly, also from TMF (http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=15725253)</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;In the days and weeks that follow, many accusations will be raised. In our despair at the devastation of what has happened, I pray we do not allow racial/religious hatred to play a part.</p>

<p>There is a chance, perhaps a good chance, that this &quot;bin Laden&quot; idiot is involved. If so, then it has been an idiot&#8217;s campaign, not an Arab/Muslim one. These are not the same thing.</p>

<p>Good Muslims are just as horrified by what has happened as you are. The faith of Islam is a kind one, based on many of the same fundamentals as more Western religions. It is terribly important that we remember this.</p>

<p>If an isolated group of &quot;pinheads&quot;, in the name of Allah, have done this beastly deed, than THEY must be held accountable. Allah didn&#8217;t deem this as right, and I&#8217;m sure the mullahs of Morocco, and Egypt, and Arabia, and Iran, and Pakistan, and even Afghanistan will agree.</p>

<p>This is NOT a Muslim thing! This is a terrorist thing. The Pope doesn&#8217;t support bombings in Belfast for the same reason.</p>

<p>In our efforts to prosecute the guilty, remember that whoever did this has sinned under Islamic Law as well.</p>

<p>seansan &lt;/I&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s 1400 and I have been up for 6-7 hours, depending on wether you count reading in bed as up ;)</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s a good day. I got my local parking thingie done, which lets me park anywhere near my (current) home for another 4 months for free. Otherwise I would have to buy a parking ticket every time. Ok, for that I had to drive around a bit because the place where I got it last time has been torn down. I was kind of suprised coming there :) But I have it.</p>

<p>Then I took care of a lot of bills to pay, some parking tickets, some other things and re-registering at the local university for physics. Wonderful.</p>

<p>And now I just returned from a Telekom shop and it was a pleasant experience, yes really! First of all I learnt that I can transfer the entire phone system from Aachen to Cologne without a problem, which would be nice. But if I don&#8217;t want to, then I can just as well cancel the entire thing even though I have not used up the 12 months contract time because&#8230; well, I&#8217;m moving, they can&#8217;t really force me they said. Yupiii :) All good there.</p>

<p>The other thing I wanted to go to the Telekom for was for our company mobile phones. The thing is that they are braking down but our 24 months contract is not up yet and we can, theoretically, not upgrade our phones with a discount until late February 2002. But after explaining the situation (and telling them that we have kind of high bills ;)) an upgrade was agreed for close to the normal upgrade price!!! The phones we are getting (Siemens ME45) cost 400 EUR without contract, about 160 EUR with a 24 months contract and we are now paying 225 EUR, which is less than I expected.</p>

<p>Oh, and this morning I worked with my brother on our P3P implementation for the counter which is half working, or was half working when I left for Telekom. Need to continue looking into this. The problem is that it recognizes the privacy policy. Agrees that no personal idenfiable info is gathered. Should agree (due to the IE6 standard privacy policy) that a cookie is ok then. But still doesn&#8217;t allow the cookie to be written. Wonderful. Computer sucks ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just eat a rollo with salami. And that&#8217;s not this sweet chocolate rollo ;)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s like a very thin pizza with tomato, cheeze (as usual for a pizza) plus salad (could be totally mixed, I had green salad and onions) plus tzatziki or some other sauce ( I too arabic which is a bit more spicy) and then (for me) salami (you could take ham or something else you would put on a pizza). All this is accumulated in the middle just like with a pita and then rolled up and rounded up with a few spices over it. Then it&#8217;s baked just like a pizza (obviously the cheeze just melts inside).</p>

<p>As I don&#8217;t think anyone remotely understood that I will just say that it was very tasty. Interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some time ago I started thinking about the great potential in Biotech. I just do not know enough about this to pick one or even a few companies. I would possibly go for Human Genome Sciences but that just includes a lot of risk. So I have been looking around for a fund with a pharma / biotech focus to invest in.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s Pharma/wHealth by Sal Oppenheim:</p>

<p>http://www.oppenheim.com/asset/sectors/public/pdf/pharma_whealth_port.pdf</p>

<p>http://de.biz.yahoo.com/mutual_funds/micropal/ga/fund/973039/index.html</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been the best fund for both a 3 and 5 year period and place 4 in a one year period in the sector.</p>

<p>The thing that interested me most about this one is though that it is not only managed by Sal Oppenheim, but they manage it together with a group of several pharma/biotech consulting companies.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be putting in a fixed amount per month now to take care a bit for my life in 30 years ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Five cannibals get appointed as programmers in an IT company.
During the welcoming ceremony the boss says: &quot;You&#8217;re all part of our team
now.You can earn good money here, and you can go to the company canteen for
something to eat.  Just don&#8217;t trouble the other employees&quot;.  The cannibals
promise not to trouble the other employees.
Four weeks later the boss returns and says: &quot;You&#8217;re all working very
hard,and I&#8217;m very satisfied with all of you.  One of our cleaners has
disappeared however.  Do any of you know what happened to her?&quot;  The
cannibals disavow all knowledge of the missing cleaner. After the boss has
left, the leader of the cannibals says to the others &quot;Which of you idiots
ate the cleaner?&quot;   A hand raises hesitantly, to which the leader of the
cannibals says &quot;You fool!  For four weeks we&#8217;ve been eating Team Leaders,
Managers,and Project Managers so no-one would notice anything, and you have
to go and eat the cleaner!&quot;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am getting somewhere with my WML home page. WML being the way WAP pages are developed just like HTML. It can be a pain sometimes though as it is very strict with the tags.</p>

<p>Anyway. I now have moved the general features of my <a href="http://oliver.thylmann.com/links/links.php">links list</a> over to WML. I still need to make some layout stuff to make it look a bit better and remove some things and so on. And via the main page you can look up one of my quotes at random or find my e-mail or call me. The call me is especially fun as it just brakes down the WAP connection and starts a call on the mobile phone. I am trying to do the &quot;Add me to your Addressbook&quot; part but that somehow does not work yet ;)</p>

<p>Still lots to do and learn, but it&#8217;s fun.</p>
