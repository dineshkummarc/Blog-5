  <div class="entry-content"><p>So what do those two have to do in the same headline together? Several things actually. One is that on tuesday <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/archive/2004/05/#4216">Creative Commons 2.0 was launched</a>, simplifying the structure a little bit and getting some initial problems out. Maybe even more interesting than a new version though is somebody really using Creative Commons, somebody big. It seems that the <a href="http://digital-lifestyles.info/display_page.asp?section=distribution&amp;amp;id=1254">BBC is looking in a Creative Commons kind of license for their digital archive</a>!</p>

<p>This really would potentially mean that you can download and even change lots and lots of the work the BBC has done over the years, building on it, packaging it again, as long as you don&#8217;t make any money from it. It will be interesting to see what comes out of it, but all in all, great stuff.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>David Weinberger posted on Worthwhile that he is &lt;a title=&quot;Spoiled&quot; href=&quot;http://www.worthwhilemag.com/entry/2004/05/26/spoiled.php&quot;&gt;Spoiled&lt;/a&gt;. Why? He was at a lovely hotel with all the luxury most people want and all he can do is complain that there is no broadband ;) His conclusion is great:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;First, that I have become a complete brat when it comes to Internet access. Second, that the Hyatt Regency is mistaken if it thinks that because it&#8217;s a resort, it doesn&#8217;t need to offer broadband in the bedroom; it&#8217;s not just for Net geeks any more. Third, that with my particular pathology I can no longer tell the difference between relaxing and being bored.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>They all seem to be ringing a bell. It&#8217;s hard for me to just sit arround relaxing but also hard to get bored really. As for geeks and broadband though, at least I try to leave stuff like a laptop at home when I go on holiday to relax. That&#8217;s time to finally get the reading list down and do some creative thinking.</p>

<p>But one thing about broadband and especially free broadband in Hotels. I recently talked to a friend about it and it did become clear why they don&#8217;t offer free or even cheap broadband. It&#8217;s all a question of competition. If everybody charges $3 per minute, nobody has a problem. If you then do it for free, you have a competitive advantage &#8230; for a week, then everybody also does it free and everybody has a problem.</p>

<p>So there goes the reason for no free broadband in hotels. Still, not having broadband at all is a pain. Even not having WiFi is a nogo already I have to admit, at least in a semi-holiday setting or business trip.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I just found out via <a href="http://www.mobitopia.com/20040525.html#115413">this post</a> on Mobitopia, <a href="http://www.verisign.com/corporate/news/2004/pr_20040524.html">Versign just acquired Jamba</a>, the German wireless content service. They did so for $273 Million, $177.45 million of those in cash. Jamba has about 300 full-time staff and will contribute roughly $70 million in revenues in the second half of 2004 to Verisign. There will be no contribution to EPS. Versign therefor paid something like twice revenue but likely a very much higher multiple on profit, which is likely slim. The price doesn&#8217;t seem to be that much too high really if the revenue numbers are correct.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/002129.shtml">Thanks to this post by Heiko</a>, I also found out that the Samwer brothers, who founded Jamba, received $43 Million in eBay stock back when they sold Alando to eBay in 1999. If they didn&#8217;t sell, this would be worth roughly $120+ million today, dependent on the exact date. I still remember Oliver Samwer speaking at my University when they just had sold.</p>

<p>All in all. Interesting move, pushing forward the importance of mobile life really and adding another few millions to the Samwer Brothers&#8217; bank accounts. I wonder how long they will stay at Versign. They left eBay pretty quickly ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;a title=&quot;Teaching Leadership in Context&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/articles/archive/hmintzberg.html&quot;&gt;Teaching Leadership in Context&lt;/a&gt; is an article by Henry Mintzberg about the fact that you can&#8217;t really create leaders by teaching the theory about it. You need a mix of experience, exchange, and insight within that context and personal understanding. I admit that I might be barely ready to do the MBA I am doing now, but a great thing about the part-time MBA Systems, like the one of the Open University Business School, are that you are still working. You are still gaining experience. You are trying to link stuff together. I was self employed but I chose to work at a bigger company because of what Mintzberg is saying here. I was loosing out in things like People Management where I saw the theory but didn&#8217;t get the experience. The experience is very very important really and the biggest stumbling block within the OUBS Courses I think.</p>

<p>Mintzberg ist founding director of <a href="http://www.impm.org/">IMPM</a>, the International Masters Program in Practicing Management. This is a really amazing course where you really have to be in top management to even start and get something out of it. There are 5 modules split over different universities world wide. There was a very good article about it in the Harvard Business Review recently. Now this is a thing I could see myself doing in maybe 10 or 15 years. The experience must be amazing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Heiko has a great story showing how hard computers are still to use these days, at least for the average user: &lt;a title=&quot;Mom wants to email an attachment by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hebig.com/archives/002127.shtml&quot;&gt;Mom wants to email an attachment&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>I can so feel with him. It&#8217;s the basic things that are still very hard to grasp for somebody who doesn&#8217;t use these things daily and doesn&#8217;t go behind how it works once. I mean where do you save your file should be of no importance. It should just open whenever you want to. Maybe that needs an additional interface, and maybe a database with versioning and things. We have the storage. We just need the interface.</p>
