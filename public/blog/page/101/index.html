  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Ok, this iss cool. I am finding too much cool stuff today. Here are the&amp;nbsp; &lt;a title=&quot;SMBmeta Specification Version 0.9 Proposal&quot; href=&quot;http://www.trellixtech.com/smbmetaspec09proposal.html&quot;&gt;SMBmeta Specification Version 0.9 Proposal&lt;/a&gt; specs. This is an XML file format that could be put in the root directory of your site if you have a pizzaria or something and would allow search engines to find a pizzaria in your neighborhood, that has still open, has what you want, blah blah blah. Very nice. Of course this is only a small part of the semantic web idea that is growing but it shows where this might lead. The <a href="http://wasserfuhr.com/nodes/node.jsp?session=3u9EbQzuUmySTdp&amp;amp;id=1151">source</a> has some further info on this.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

Ok people, this is muchos coolos. I am trying to write this in a weird language so it gets some weight. I wanted to book a flight to Copenhagen some time ago and it was hard getting a good price. A friend told me that SAS had a good deal but they seemed to be booked out for the day I wanted to go. Then I remembered the <a href="http://reisen.kelkoo.de/b/a/c_172201_fluge.html">Kelkoo Flight Price Search</a>. Boy this thing kicks. You enter from where to where, when, a time preference, how many people and then search over all the airlines out there. Ok, all might be overdoing it a bit but it looks via Air Berlin, Air France, Basicq Air, Skytours, Condor, eBookers.de, Germanwings, hlx.com and Opodo, which pretty much covers it, except the ultra cheap maybe. But those you can cover with a few clicks because they mostly don&#8217;t fly from or to where you want to go. :) I now have the SAS flight via eBookers.com at the price I wanted. Always good to remember that some bookers get packages of seats so if a flight is full somewhere, it might not be somewhere else, as seems to have been the case now. Copenhagen here I come.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Ok, this can be called a big day for search. Big for one, because Google increased it&#8217;s index from roughly 5 billion to roughly 8 billion page as <a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/11/googles-index-nearly-doubles.html"> title=&quot;Google Blog&quot;&gt;posted on their blog</a>. This alone is probably a big leap for their architecture and nice indeed. It coincides nicely with the launch of the <a href="http://beta.search.msn.com">MSN Search Beta</a>. The site is actually very nice, and it found out my location easily. What I think is good for the location bit though is that I can edit it if I want to. Microsoft also added the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/msnsearch">Microsoft Search Blog</a> and as <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001029.php">John Battelle posts</a> they are actually thinking about opening up the technology to create a kind of ecosystem where third parties can plug into the system and build cool applications. Google obviously already has their <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/">public API</a> but this is just the start and there are endless of opportunities, especially if you allow people to play with the ranking algorithms and such. <a href="http://forrester.typepad.com/charleneli/2004/11/msn_search_debu.html">Charlene Li&#8217;s post</a> has some info that there is a natural language processer in there as well that will try to get some additional information out of what you asked. A very cool thing is their &lt;em&gt;Search Builder&lt;/em&gt; which allows you to play around in the search results. Nice to play around with.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Expect some interesting things. Their recent deal with Kanoodle for contextual advertising on TypePad might bring us a free version of the system. Or they create a more easy to build branded solution (not that I know if their current one is hard to build, but it can always be easier). Then of course there is stuff like staffing needs, motivation, what to develop inhouse, linking typekey to sxip (made that one up ;)), route to going public, &#8230; Heads are cooking. Brains are churning out ideas. Interesting times.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>CNET and <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>? Yes. I had this sitting in my Bloglines Clips for some time now wanting to blog about it, but it seems that CNET Networks has hired Matt Mullenweg, the guy behind WordPress. WordPress has been picking up steam in the blogosphere and seems to be a great application. I have to admit that I have been playing with it a bit myself, just for the fun of it.</p>

<p>The interesting thing to ask yourself is what they will do with this. Sure, they might have just hired a very good developer and will use WordPress to keep abreast of the Blogging world out there, but that can&#8217;t be all of it. They might have seen the power and might go into the blogging business to some extent. They do know news, they know how to run a big site and they know how to do it profitably. All in all they know some things about content, journalism, writing, advertising, the web, search engines, lots of stuff that is relevant for blogging too. Keep and eye on this one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Interesting business idea comes to me via <a href="http://www.micropersuasion.com/">Steve Rubel&#8217;s Micropersuasion</a>. He links to <a href="http://susanmernit.blogspot.com/2004/11/ojr-msn-gm-imagines-blogging-business.html">a post</a> by <a href="http://susanmernit.blogspot.com/">Susan Mernit</a>. She talks about MSN Network GM Scott More being quoted with something interesting. (Still following me? ;))</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;&quot;If you&#8217;re a blogger, MSN might come to you and say, &#8216;We want to distribute you. We&#8217;ll send you traffic and we want you to run these ads on your site, and you&#8217;ll get a share of revenues on that. That&#8217;s probably an offer that many bloggers are going to be interested in because they don&#8217;t want to have to invest in creating that kind of infrastructure, and they would value the traffic.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Truely insightful. The thing is that they would be extending their reach greatly. Click through rates on blogs are likely a lot bigger than on the search engine directly. A well ranked blog on the MSN search engine will likely be ranked not too badly on others and get good traffic there too, again with higher click throughs. This is an interesting view on leveraging the long tail.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Well this VoIP race is getting more and more interesting. In my latest post about it I said that Skype might have a problem that they are not SIP (see <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/09/skype_and_voip.html">here</a>). I still stand by that but still Skype is getting some interesting features I have to say. Based on <a href="http://www.mobilemag.com/content/100/104/C3402/">this article on MobileMag</a> Siemens just released an USB Adapter that will allow you to link your PC Skype version to their DECT headsets. Now how cool is that? Very cool. Now Skype needs incoming call numbers world wide, so that I have a US number and a German Number and a Belgium number and a Dutch number and a UK number &#8230; that are the most important ones I think at this moment. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

The alien was from Halo 2 for the Xbox and this was a planned &quot;Pirate Advertising&quot; that was ok&#8217;ed by BMW who also believe their Mini target group is on the weirder side. Very cool.

      <p class="meta">

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;If knowledge is so important to an enterprise then you might see your own career development as the trading of your own knowledge and if this is the case, will this ring in a new form of employment?</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Tom Steward puts it nicely by saying that in today&#8217;s economy, knowledge is what you buy and sell and you can&#8217;t smell or touch it. Fritz Machlup analyzed loads of data for his 1962 book &quot;The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States&quot; and found that from 1900 to 1959 the US labour force grew by 137% but the knowledge producing occupations by 602%. Daniel Bell in his book &quot;The Coming of the Post Industrial Society&quot; from 1973 focussed on scientific knowledge, which could influence production methods.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In terms of the role of technology in knowledge management, Marc Baker of Royal Mail says: Knowledge management is 70% people, 20% process and 10% technology. This falls well in place with a big problem with de-layering, downsizing and generally letting people go, as best said in a quote by George Santayana: Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Drivers for Knowledge Management include:
- Wealth from knowledge
- Knowledge Interdependency
- Technology
- Innovation
- Organizational Learning
- Human Resources&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Managing Knowledge in Practice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of knowledge presented in this part of the course:
- Expert networks
- Corporate and people knowledge
- Intellectual property assets
- Intangible parts of knowledge: intellectual capital and managing it as a knowledge managing activity
- Capturing and Re-Using past experiences
- Embedding knowledge in products, services, brands and processes
- Producing knowledge
- Driving knowledge generation for innovation
- Building and mining knowledge stores&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This gives us 9 categories. The problem with mining them for profit is questionable. Can any type of knowledge be thought of as valid and reliable in the long term aka durable, a given needed for sustainable advantage.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Definitions of knowledge management is hard but Xerox has a good example: Knowledge management is the discipline of creating a thriving work and learning environment that fosters the continuous creation, aggregation, use and re-use of both organizational and personal knowledge in the pursuit of new business value.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The cross-boundary part of knowledge management is often forgotten though. Knowledge is often written about in terms of its capability as an asset of producing value aka intellectual capital. This is often seen as evident through the difference of market and book value.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;It can also be said that this difference is simply looking at future profit streams which are based on the future market but also on the track record, resources and capabilities of the enterprise, which again amounts to intellectual capital.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Pay attention though that for the sake of balancing assets and liabilities a lot of companies have huge amounts of goodwill in their books. So profits might not be the best comparison. Due to prudence in financial accounting the goodwill should still be less than the difference between book and market value.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Information management (technology) is only a small part of knowledge management. The learning organization is likely a better fit, but it has become something like TQM and will not be covered in great depth here.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Where does all this lead us? This best is very difficult to define!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is knowledge anyway?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The greek word for knowledge is episteme, leading us to epistomology, the study of or theories about knowledge. In terms of worlds, it is interesting to note that the English language has one word: knowledge. The french have connaitre and savoir. The germans have kennen and wissen. This leads us to a definition: Knowledge is that which is known.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of different ways to &quot;know&quot; though and the question arises by whom and if all knowledge is valid and true. Tacit knowledge, a term coined by Polanyi is also possibly impossible to share. At best it will be given from expert to apprentice through watching and trial and error under guidance.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Bishop Berkelly supported the argument that your real world is a projection of your mind and no real world exists (for us) outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Scientific knowledge is not really truth either but rather gained through positivism, a confirmation of an experiment leading to a scientific law, a &quot;proven&quot; hypothesis. The root here is induction, meaning that you more from special observations to a general idea.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;As an example, quantum physics explains to a large degree what happens in the small, but it is still but a theory. Even A leads to Event B a million times does not mean that Event A really leads to Even B (Hume&#8217;s problem)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;We end up with what Machlup called &quot;not yet falsified&quot; knowledge. So scientific knowledge is not really special or truer.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Polanyi also said something else: We know more than we can tell.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This is the tacit knowledge problem. Gibbons in &quot;The New Production of Knowledge&quot; argues that we now have Mode 1 and Mode 2 knowledge, where Mode 2 is more implicit, stored within us, and gaining importance. Mode 2 is also a bit allied with the idea of the reflective practitioner. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Kuhn argues that science is based on paradigms and as there are no independent facts a paradigm shift is more of a battle between different social groups, with different languages and assumptions. Hence science is not a quest for objective truth.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Data, Information and Knowledge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Peter Drucker said that information is &quot;data endowed with relevance and purpose&quot;. Data is unorganized observations, numbers, words, sounds and images. Information is data arranged and processes into meaningful patterns. Knowledge is information put into productive use, made actionable and given meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You move from Data to Information (Data with Content), to Knowledge (Information with meaning) to Wisdom (knowledge with insight).&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Remember though that data for your might be knowledge for somebody else. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;How do you make a knowledge typology then:
- Knowing that
- Knowing how
- Knowing who
- Knowing when
- Knowing where
- Knowing why&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Quinn orders these into several categories on a personal level.
- Cognitive knowledge (know what)
- Advanced skills (Know how)
- Systems understanding (know why)
- Self-motivated creativity (care why=&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Karl Wiig classified knowledge management as:
- factual knowledge
- conceptual knowledge
- Expectational knowledge
- Methodological knowledge&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;The B823 approach and themes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The course moves from an individual to a group/team and on to the organizational and extra-organizational process and context. Then it moves back to how the organization can manage the individual for knowledge. Themes are:
