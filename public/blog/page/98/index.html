  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Thanks go to Perun for initiating a blogger meeting in cologne. We are the media city, or so they say, and we should get going here. As he mentions in <a href="http://www.perun.net/archiv/2004/11/23/blogger-treffen-in-koeln/#comments"> title=&quot;Peruns Blog - Webwork und Internet ï¿½ Blogger-Treffen in Koeln&quot;&gt;his post (German)</a> the second or third weekend in January is currently when it is planned. I am voting for the third weekend. He set up a special <a href="http://www.perun.net/wiki/BloggerTreff">wiki page</a> where you can voice your interest. Go register everyone. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I <a href="http://bt.thylmann.net">installed</a> <a href="http://blogtorrent.com/">Blog Torrent</a> and now I don&#8217;t know what to do with it. The thing is that this system is not server based. I create a torrent on my desktop and then upload the torrent but need to stay online for it to seed. At the moment there is only a windows version for the client side but a linux and mac version are sure to come. Then I might use it some more, for now be free to use <a href="http://bt.thylmann.net">bt.thylmann.net</a> as a trial system. Everyone can create accounts and upload things. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;But this actually got me thinking again about Bittorrent. What if we create a bittorrent like system with a bit of Akamai in it. I mean a server based system that seeds large files in the network. This in itself isn&#8217;t too wonderful but what if you could also publish your bandwidth cap saying for example that you have 10GB of bandwidth per month on your server and you have 8 set aside for your Bittorrent. When everyone says that everyone can more efficiently use all their bandwidth. I doubt it would work for images within a page due to latency but for files like videos, pdf, etc. there might be a real use there. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The only problem I see at the moment in installing this system on my server would be that it could blow my bandwidth allowance out of the water within a few hours if it maxes out the connection. So all we need is a bittorrent like system, server based, with meta data on bandwidth allowed, used, limited or something like that. Then I can post a file to my network or even the network and it will be picked up. Add to that some geo targetting or bandwidth monitoring or both and I will be served the file from the nearest server(s). Maybe a little JavaApp might allow the system to not require an application on the user side. Ideas over ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;The german electronics super market Media Markt is currently running some great ads. You probably have to speak german to really understand them but the general idea is wonderful. In it a german TV Show host is making fun of some people in Media Markt, similar to how he does it in his shows. But it kind of comes on funny and in a good way, both for Media Markt and him. The tag line of the ads are (translated): Don&#8217;t let them make fun of you, especially relating the price. Actually it&#8217;s a german saying &quot;Lasst euch nicht verarschen&quot; which is a bit hard to translate.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Well now you can find all the TV Spots online, that&#8217;s actually all I wanted to say: <a href="http://www.media-markt.de/lenv/tv/"> title=&quot;Media Markt. Lasst euch nicht verarschen. TV-Spots.&quot;&gt;Media Markt. Lasst euch nicht verarschen. TV-Spots</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;TypePad is starting the holiday season with special reductions on all accounts and the option to give away TypePad accounts as presents. The cool part is though that I can now renew my pro account for a year, which I would likely have done anyway, but now I get it for less and a free account extra. The problem with this at the moment is that I for one don&#8217;t know how to renew manually and second, I am not sure if I renewal will be with the cheaper prices. But I am on it and will update this when I know. :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: More info will be posted on TypePad next week when the promotion starts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Blogg.de seems to be getting some traction recently. Nico just announced that the influential german newspaper <a href="http://www.wiwo.de">WirtschaftsWoche</a> (WiWo in short) has started several blogs by authors of the paper. You can find the main blog site at <a href="http://blog.wiwo.de/">blog.wiwo.de</a> and all the blogs run on the platform of <a href="http://www.blogg.de">Blogg.de</a>. Congratulations to Nico for the catch. The one that already made by RSS Feeds is the <a href="http://blog.wiwo.de/silicon-valley/">Silicon Valley Observer</a> by Matthias Hohensee which is the most bloggish of their list. It feels like he is speaking personally which is what makes it a joy to read.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Ross is &lt;a title=&quot;Ross Mayfield&#8217;s Weblog: Confusing the Long Tail and the Technology Adoption Lifecycle&quot; href=&quot;http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2004/11/confusing_the_l.html&quot;&gt;commenting&lt;/a&gt; on <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/11/24.html#a8707">a post</a> by Scoble which mistook the long tail for something totally different. As Ross says well, this is not about the product lifecycle curve. Early adopters are not the long tail. As Ross says a key here is transaction costs as well as search costs and storage. You will likely find some long tail in your market. Let&#8217;s take something a bit out of the ordinary for this. One good example is things like <a href="http://www.spreadshirt.de">Spreadshirt</a> of <a href="http://www.cafepress.com">CafePress</a>. Both of those shops allow you to make your own T-Shirt in low volume. When things started out in the clothing industry, T-Shirts were probably really hard to make and especially flock print was not too easy and needed to be done in bigger volumes. You needed to be a big customer to do this. You needed to have a brand to sell the T-Shirt in high volume. Then people started to do this on their own, in smaller shops around the world. This of course works great but you will only have so many people doing that in your shop. Now come the web shops that will let you build your own T-Shirt, and anyone can do it, in tiny volume, because both of the backends have technology that enabled them to make t-shirts in good quality one by one efficiently. On top of that they have the internet to reach the world. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Now we have a big department store selling CK T-Shirts in the hundreds of thousands a year in 1000 department stores. That mass market. Then we have Spreadshirt and CafePress who will sell 100 T-Shirts of 100.000 different small shops over a year, in the end selling mor T-Shirts than the CK example above, but only to tiny audiences and in lots of different fits and sizes. This wouldn&#8217;t have been possible previously, because you wouldn&#8217;t have had the distribution system, nor the printing technology, or the possibility to reach these tiny audiences efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s an example of the long tail. Others would be Amazon selling loads of books that you will find in no other book store because they can connect 10s of millions of people world wide to the 3 issues they have somewhere. Or Google efficiently handling advertisement on blogs due to their content targeting. It&#8217;s really volume matching. Matching the right volumes over longer distances that were previously not matchable.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s very likely worthwhile to just think what they long tail can mean for you. Sell side advertising is something that will become very real (already well into thinking into it) to some extent due to the efficient use of the long tail and the different market specifics that are available there.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Russel&#8217;s post on <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008176.html"> title=&quot;Russell Beattie Notebook - VoIP and VoiceXML&quot;&gt;VoIP and VoiceXML</a> pointed me once again to <a href="http://www.tellme.com/">TellMe</a>, a company I had looked at when they founded and thought to be amazingly cool. I remember them having fotos of their new offices online which was fun to look at. They were this bunch of people with a vision, most of them coming from AOL/Netscape which was a big story back then anyway. I did wonder why they thought they could be so huge and I did feel said when they had to scale back and kind of got lost under the radar. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Now Russel sends me back there and I am amazed. They have been an enormous success I will have to say. Checking out their clients list and milestones is a joy to see and there is still lots of potential. It&#8217;s just differently worded. They did want to create the voice internet. Giving you access to everything online kind of. Now they really seem to be working more along the line of automating things you call. This once again shows that you need the drive and commitment to follow through, but to also potentially change your business model or your view of the world along the way. Congratulations guys. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am currently thinking a lot about outsourcing for different reasons and TJ&#8217;s post on <a href="http://www.tjacobi.com/archives/outsourcing_your_headquarter.html">outsourcing your headquarter</a> is very interesting in that respect. Not only because it is about outsourcing but also about the power cities play in a knowledge economy and in relation to the connectedness of our current world. I had a nice short chat with the current knowledge management tutor and you can really start questioning whether you need to be in a city or even whether we need big cities at all, at least for corporations. <a href="http://www.kozoru.com/">Kozoru</a> (great site, intriguing idea though not new) which the post by TJ is about, is actually sitting in some small town in the US where things a lot cheaper, a lot more beautiful and a lot more calm. Maybe the perfect setting for a startup that wants to get most bang for the buck. This might even be a competitive advantage for a startup that doesn&#8217;t need a big factory or thousands of workers at one location. SocialText is similar here in that they simply don&#8217;t have an office as such but work virtually. The world is changing, change with it people!</p>
