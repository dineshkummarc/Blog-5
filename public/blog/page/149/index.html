  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think that <a href="http://www.furl.net/">Furl</a> will eventually improve the content of my blog. Why? At the moment I am more or less blogging what interests me, including short blurbs on things that I read. This might puts ideas and comments in the same blog as simple reminders, which are likely less interesting to some people. Now those reminders will be furled and not blogged and for those interested they can subscribe to my furl rss feed.</p>

<p>In general, furl can be seen as a link blog, especially with the option to comment, and this link blog thing is growing on me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to the &lt;a title=&quot;License-Exempt Soweto: Update on Orkut Juggernaut&quot; href=&quot;http://www.rafer.net/blog/000246.html&quot;&gt;License-Exempt Soweto: Update on Orkut Juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; post, I checked out <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;amp;range=3m&amp;amp;size=large&amp;amp;compare_sites=friendster.com&amp;amp;url=orkut.com">the Alexa comparison of Orkut and Friendster</a> and boy is Orkut rising fast. It is now already the 505th most used site on the net, which is amazingly high, especially considering that they only just started.</p>

<p>Also interesting to note is that Orkut seems to be called &quot;Project Eden&quot; inside Google, something that is also hinted on <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/000261.php">John Battelle&#8217;s post about Orkut</a>.</p>

<p>I do have to say though that having it invite only makes Orkut a bit special and seeing your network grow is fun, more so than at LinkedIn because it is just more open, more sharing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tickets are booked and on my table. Come thursday I will be off to Bruxelles to continue to Milton Hill House in Abingdon near Oxford on Friday. Why? Each of my <a href="http://oubs.open.ac.uk/">MBA</a> courses has a so called residential school, where lots of students meet somewhere with lots of tutors and go through the course. This time I am going to <a href="http://www.uk-hotel-accommodation.co.uk/England/hotels/miltonhillhouse.cfm">Milton Hill House</a> and it looks very nice I have to say. It will be a three day event talking nothing but finance for most of the day, following by long evenings in the pub just to rise early and talk finance again. You guessed it, the current course is finance and I am just writing one of the required papers which is due on monday and boy is this stressing.</p>

<p>But who am I to complain, I chose to do this. :) And I am looking forward to seeing Oxford, some new students and generally get drawn into finance even further. Lovely subject.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.pelczarski.com/gonutty/index.htm">Keith Pelczarski</a>, whom I met during his time at <a href="http://www.fool.com/">Motley Fool</a>, just sent me an invitation to Orkut (Thanks Keith! :)) and I have to say that I like what I am seeing. Due to the broader focus than <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>, it&#8217;s a bit more time consuming to set it up, but you&#8217;ll have lots more information about yourself in there afterwards. I do think that it&#8217;s an interesting way to meet new people, and am happily surprised about the feature richness and performance of the service.</p>

<p>But this post goes beyond simply talking about Orkut, which I might do a bit more when I have more experience with it, but rather I am starting to see a real value, especially for Google, in this type of thing, if you just add one tiny variable. Google is starting to have problems with their page rank algorithm, especially because links are so easy to create in the time of blogs and content management systems, and databases and scripts. They will need to tweak their search algorithms to continue to give out the best results possible. This is actually where <a href="http://www.furl.net/">Furl</a>, which I already raved about in earlier posts, comes in. For those not yet in the know, Furl allows you to easily bookmark, or rathr &quot;furl&quot;, a page. This is then cached by Furl, and you can rate it, put it in categories, write something about it and add keywords. The entire database is then searchable and not only by me but also by anyone who cares to <a href="http://www.furl.net/members/olivert">take a look at my furls</a>.</p>

<p>This still does make finding stuff in general not a hell of a lot easier, but you can now add Orkut&#8230; and Google. You can then search the web, search your furls, search within your friends furls, or search within your friends friends furls too, get recommendations based on most furled items within your bigger friends network, make page rank take into account furls of any page within the context of the network of the person that furled the page, &#8230; You can go on and on with this. The opportunities are endless. The problem is that it likely needs to be free, because it needs to be very big.</p>

<p>So please, Google, go public, buy Furl, integrate Orkut and give me networked-search. Thanks for listening.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This seems to be Jeremy week. Is it my fault that he has some interesting things to say? ;) Anyway, he just put some stuff online about the &lt;a title=&quot;My Yahoo!

I wondered when Yahoo! would do that and now its there and it should finally prove to some of the executives out there that RSS is a force to really really take into account.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I added &lt;a&gt;furl&lt;/a&gt; to the services I use and I will be doing so a lot starting now. I just need to get used to not pressing bookmark, but furl, and not sending eMails to work with links I want to look at there but to furl it. It&#8217;s a great service, check it out.</p>

<p>The nice thing is that you can also add your latest entries from Furl to your own website, at the time via JavaScript. I am already including my People feeds from <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>, another great service by the way, via JavaScript. There is one bad thing with this JavaScript integration though. Bots can&#8217;t follow the link because they simply ignore JavaScript. So I wondered if I cannot simply include them in PHP and started looking for a URL that I could include that didn&#8217;t return JavaScript code with it. Nothing to be found, on either of the services. So yesterday evening I mailed both Furl and Bloglines with the question of providing none JavaScript feeds.</p>

<p>Furler numero 1 Mike answered first in that they do provide an RSS Feed or if I needed something else, and I had to admit that I was playing it a bit lazy there, as I could have integrated that. I replied that I can do that, but that I was just being lazy (you have to honest :)) and simply wanted to include plain HTML. A few hours later, back comes a link that works perfectly! Now I include <a href="http://www.furl.net/htLatest.jsp?id=368&amp;amp;count=10">my 10 latest furls</a> in PHP just fine.</p>

<p>Then I wake up and I have a mail from Bloglines founder <a href="http://www.wingedpig.com/">Mark Fletcher</a> say nothing more than thanking me f or the suggestion and that they will have a HTML version soon. &quot;&lt;i&gt;;-)&lt;/i&gt;&quot;. Just 30 minutes later I get an eMail that they just rolled it out. If you go to the help page on <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/help/share/">sharing your Bloglines subscriptions</a> you get walked through to a page that will then give you a JavaScript version and it now says:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;If you use PHP or another method to include raw HTML into your blog, use the following URL instead, which returns the blogroll as HTML.</p>

<p>http://rpc.bloglines.com/blogroll?html=1&amp;id=biz&amp;folder=People&amp;target=_blank&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>Now how cool is that?That line might even be put there for me, as it fits to my question, but emm&#8230; I doubt that. :) Both services responded by implementing it and they did it amazingly fast. Thank you Bloglines and thank your Furl for the great service!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There we have it. Just yesterday <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001466.html">I commented</a> on a post on Jeremy Zawodny&#8217;s blog about how we are starting to see <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001466.html">Social Network Backlash</a> and today, Google goes into the social networking field with <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">Orkut</a> and now <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001473.html">Jeremy seems to have lots of friends</a>.</p>

<p>More about the service can be found in <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1026_3-5146006.html">&lt;i&gt;Google spawns social networking service&lt;/i&gt;</a> on news.com and in <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/35067.html">&lt;i&gt;Google debuts Friendster-clone Orkut&lt;/i&gt;</a> on The Register. I think it should be obvious who is running the slightly negative piece ;)</p>

<p>Interesting to note is that The Register reports that Orkut is done by Google employee &lt;i&gt;Orkut Buyukkokten&lt;/i&gt;. News.com goes in a bit deeper noting that this seems to be a side project of Orkut, which he developed in his 20% of doing-whatever-you-want system Google has. Google even says that they do not see Orkut as part of their portfolio but it does own the technology, he developed it at work, that 20% system starts sounding interesting ey? ;).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/000249.php">John Battelle&#8217;s mention</a> of it, I just looked at <a href="http://www.furl.net/">Furl</a>.  To simply quote what John quoted:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;Furl is a new web browsing tool that lets you save and organize thousands of useful web pages (you know, the ones you want to save for future reference but then can never find again) in a personal &quot;web page filing cabinet&quot;.</p>

<p>Once saved, you can effortlessly find any page again later using a powerful full text search tool. With Furl you can forget trying to save and organize dozens of bookmarks, forget saving web pages to your desktop, in fact forget everything except how to find a useful web page again next time you need it. &lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>And the interface looks very nice. Many of the important things I blog anyway but there is lots of stuff you see all over the day and you end up not finding them anymore because you didn&#8217;t bookmark them, they are in the wrong inbox, they are on the wrong computer, you simply forgot, or the search engine made a little dance and doesn&#8217;t find it anymore. There might be a million reasons. Now with one little click, I got it. Very nice.  And I can even rate the page, put keywords in there or comments. I&#8217;ll really be trying to use this. Very nice. &#8230; Oh, I am repeating myself ;)</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: You can see my stuff <a href="http://www.furl.net/members/olivert">here</a> and can even get a <a href="http://www.furl.net/members/olivert/rss.xml">RSS Feed of my documents!!!</a> This is getting cooler by the minute :)</p>
