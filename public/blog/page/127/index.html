  <div class="entry-content"><p>I would beg that this is not true but presume it is. Nico <a href="http://nico.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=286">posted an entry</a> about a funny little detail that Toll-Collect revealed. For those not intheknow, Toll-Collect is a consortia of different big german companies that are trying to tackle the task of allowing the german state to collect money from trucks that use our german Autobahn. In itself, a good idea. It&#8217;s just that they are overexpensive, delayed like hell, and seemingly a group of nutcases. Based on the <a href="http://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID3331810_REF1,00.html">german story</a> linked at Nico&#8217;s post, Toll Collect now said that they would need to know the fee to be collected relatively soon as it will be hardcoded into the machines set up inside the trucks!!! The On-Board-Units cannot be changed later on!!! I think I understand it. We put a fixed rate in on board units, which are then tracked with Cameras, wireless and satelite connections in all of Germany. Great stuff. This one will surely reach the MBA case study text books before too long :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gizmodo posted a picture with <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/samsungs-heart-swelling-olympic-reminder-015743.php">a note to torchbearers</a> from Samsung for this years Olympics. In short, Samsung urges you to say that you thank them on your knees that due to them, you are allowed to carry the olympic flame. I really hope it is a joke. Otherwise, I agree with the last line in their comment: &lt;I&gt;Just makes you want to go out and buy a 46&quot; LCD TV screen from Samsung, inspired by their spirit of international athletic brotherhood, don&#8217;t it?&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>In November 2002 I wrote a view for infoSync entitled <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2002/11/blogging_goes_w.html">Blogging goes wireless</a>, in which I said, among other things, that with moblogging, the times when journalists were first at the scene is over.  Point one of the above list hints on that in that they suggest asking for feedback from your readers who have been at the scene. They also talk about the idea of inviting your readers to blog on the site and adding good posts to the newspaper. I like it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Judging by <a href="http://birdhouse.org/blog/archives/001327.php">Scot Hacker&#8217;s post about it</a> as well as <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=7265">Eugenia&#8217;s wonderful article on osnews.com</a>, BeOS would be 10 years this time arround. Oh boy, that was a time. I started out with PCs when I got my first Windows 95 Box in a student home with 10mbit/s laser-based connection to the university backbone and hence the internet. I hated computers before that time but ended up administering the network, a really old and amazing (you could fold out the harddisks and surf behind the fans! ;)) sun workstation running solaris and mail, apache, the works. I still remember trying to install Windows for Workgroups on a really old PC with something like 8MB of RAM. Oh boy, the joy. Surfing the net, I soon found Be Leading Edge, one of the first if not the first news site about BeOS out there. I had to join up and still call some of the people behind it my friends. It enriched increadibly.</p>

<p>With a short stop at BeView, which was disbanded again soon, I moved on to join Adrian Ziemkowski and some others at BeNews. This started the time of what I think was the biggest and best online news site about BeOS out there. Sorry for those that feel offended. We had a great team and produced some very nice work. I still remember meeting Adrian and Scot at Comdex to report about BeOS. I remember <a href="http://leo.typepad.com/">Leo Laporte</a> asking whether I wanted to report about BeOS for Tech TV but I seem to have put too much emphasis in my reply that reporting for BeNews would be my focus&#8230; bad move &#8230; I never heard from him since ;) We had some great dinners with Be staff though which I still remember fondly. Oh the old times.</p>

<p>But back to BeOS. I was hocked. This was the best OS out there. It had its shortcomings, obviously, but other than that it was amazing. I remember buying a dual cpu machine just so I could see the full power of the OS. I remember playing MP3s backwards with ease. These were the times. We thought we had the world cornered, they would just have to see the light. We stopped thinking that, finally, when Palm bought Be&#8217;s property. We at BeNews thought long and hard, but in the end it was the right time to call it quits. It was hard, to say the least, deciding on your own that lots of your past time has gone down the drain, felt wasted, but it was something we had to do. We had to pulll the plug. We did. Thank you.</p>

<p>I even bought Be shares, as my first shares ever bought, ex some IBM ones which I still own today. I saw them ride way up on RedHat takeover rumors and didn&#8217;t sell, out of stupidity I&#8217;d say now. But hey, those were the hype days. Today I got a mail from Citibank. It includes a transaction on my account. I just got all my Be shares sold for 0,58 USD and there go my last Be shares. Sad, but true. After 10 years, the journey is finally over.</p>

<p>I bow down before all the people that were part of this. Thank you for the ride. I learned more in this than I could have in other places at that time and place.</p>

<p>I also found back some old articles on BeOS and other things that might be interesting for some of you. I converted them to PDF once upon a time. So check out <a href="http://oliver.thylmann.com/articles/BeOS%20History.pdf">the history of BeOS</a>, <a href="http://oliver.thylmann.com/articles/Samba%20and%20the%20World%20of%20Networking.pdf">Samba and the World of Networking</a> and <a href="http://oliver.thylmann.com/articles/T-RackS%20Review.pdf">the T-RackS review</a>. Take care everyone. On to new challenges.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The cartesian split gave birth to the organization as a mechanism for information processing. The problem is that when organizations innovate, they actually create new knowledge, from the inside out. This article looks at both epistemology (theory of knowledge) and ontology (levels of knowledge-creating entities). It also looks at four modes: socialization, externalization, combination and internatization.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Knowlede is about beliefs and commitment as well as about action and meaning. It&#8217;s context specific and relational. Knowledge is about &quot;a dynamic human process of justifying personal belief toward the truth&quot; (heavy eh? ;)).</p>

<p>An organization cannot create knowledge without individuals. We need to look at both tacit (personal, context-specific) knowledge and explicit (codified) knowledge. Knowledge conversion happens between those two, with Westeners emphasizing explicit and Japanese the tacit knowledge. Through social conversion, Nonaka (1990) argued tacit and explicit knowledge expand in terms of quality and quantity.</p>

<p>Socialization si about moving from tacit to tacit knowledge, often without language, through observation, imitation and practice fo rexample.</p>

<p>Externalization is from tacit to explicit knowledge, triggered by dialogue and collective reflection. Analogy helps here to bridge the gap between an image and a logical model.</p>

<p>Combination of explicit and explicit knowledge, also creates new knowledge. The MBA course is a good example here.</p>

<p>Internalization moves from explicit to tacit knowledge, in relation to learning-by-doing for example. Documentation enriches tacit knowledge, as it internalizes the experiences made.</p>

<p>Knowledge creation is continuous, and the conversion between the different systems needs to happen constantly. The process is a spiral, starting at the individual level and going up until it includes parties outside the company.</p>

<p>Enabling conditions for all of this are:
- Having the intention to build you knowledge
- Giving the autonomy to the individual for new ideas
- Stimulate interaction in a fluctuating and creative chaos
- Create redundant knowledge that might later be important
- Your internal diversity must match the diversity of your environment</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;There are problems that we know how to tackle and others that are new. There might be novelty, complexity or ambiguity involved here.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Creavitiy is about problems that require some novelty solution. There is high motivation and persistence involved and the biggest part is often formulating the problem itself. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are three major phases in problem solving. Perparation, production and judgement.  Mintzberg named them: identification, development and selection. The <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=%22mutilated+checkerboard+problem%22&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search">Multilated Checkerboard Problem</a> is an example here that all the different parts are important.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Very important in problem solving is satisficing and bounded rationality. We are often trying to short-cut the problem. We try to get closer to the problem step by step, then plan by modelling, analogy and abstraction. In novelty situations we are often moving in a too restricted problem space. There, adding stimuli on different terms, or removing some stimuli that might be misleading and rearranging stimuli is important.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Expertise seems to be dependent on extensive, well-organized domain-specific knowledge, with 10 years of experience often needed. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Problem identification is most important and the problem representation may strongly effect the success at the end. Sadly there is a tendendy to go for a solution too fast. You need to focus on the problem, not the solution. Another problem is called the Einstellung effect, which is about clinging to something that works well in solving a task, blocking out simpler solutions that might come up. We also have a confirmation bias, in that we try to find evidence harder than disconfirmation. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;(There is more in this article which I found irrelevant for my own thinking in relation to the course though&#8230; bounded rationality anyone ;))&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Change is quickening and it is now common to question your tactical and strategic choices and routes. There is a clear need of a balance between innovation and implementation and there might be a need for some mindsets to change. So what are the mind sets that we currently have.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;The implementation mind-set&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are some myths associated with this, or rather, some things that are thought to be important but what are slowly being proved as not to do. Here are some of them:
- To be decisive you have to be certain
- Time is always short
- Slow starts to feel like stupid
- Information is key to remove uncertainty (see above ;))
- Always show you are working&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Guy Claxton calls this the &quot;Hare Brain&quot; and the improved version of it he calls the &quot;Tortoise Mind&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes these ideas are misleading and make us focus too much, going the wrong direction as we didn&#8217;t take enough time. We get stuck in a groove. The pressure also makes the possibilities we have feel more restricted and rigid. To think outside the box, you need both time to relax and to simple tinker with ideas. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;When you allow yourself time to think, and the possibilty to be unsure, you will end up with creative ideas sooner. Analytical thinking actually becomes problematic if you are in situations with so called insight problems. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;With the old ideas of how we work, all relevant aspects of a situations need to be potentially written down. But a lot of things are hard to articulate and will elude analysis. These softer parts often are more valid than we think. Complex situations need an intuitive grasp and know how developes much faster than our ability to describe. &lt;b&gt;Expertise precedes explanation!&lt;/b&gt;. Your feelings might be correct but your confidence will be low as long as you cannot explain them. Anthony Damasio did studies after which he concluded that intuition hold intelligent action and conscious understanding together. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Incubation is another thing that the innovative mind needs. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Implications of this are among others that we need to reevaluate our thinking about how people need to work, and need to reframe our idea of what data really is. Formal reports are often not work reading, but they really are worth writing to clarify your thinking. Also, managers need to respect their hunches and people need to allow their brain to wonder arround and then focus again, in its natural rythm. On top of that you need to create conditions that are conductive to creativity.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>All in all we use a lot of metaphors to describe aspects of our lives and this includes organizational life. Morgan (1986, 1997) found eight such metaphors to describe corporations: Machine, Organism, Brain, Culture, Political systems, Psychic prison, Flux and transformation, Instrument of domination.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>The machine metaphor is characterised by an unfeeling rationality, efficiency, run like clockwork, bureaucracy, Ford&#8217;s assembly line, &#8230;</p>

<p>The biological/organism metaphor is about being alive, your own needs, interdependent parts, collaboration, evolving, but neglects the role of culture and coherence of organism that might not be found in an organisation. Machines don&#8217;t start wars. (More in a table on page 73)</p>

<p>Social metaphors came about when it became clear that corporate culture is important for performance. Knowledge is tied to the field where it is created. Morgan suggested images of organisational culture as Glue, an iceberg, an onion or an umbrella.</p>

<p>Cognitive metaphors emphasize intellectual capital and intangible assets, talking about knowledge management, creative networks and the learning organisation. Here it is important to note though that it is mostly the individual that learns. The brain metaphor is well placed here, with channels of communication and distributed knowledge. We draw attention to the hidden aspects of the organisation and the tacit knowledge locked away.</p>

<p>Systemic metaphors are about networks, focussing on the channels of communication. Complexity comes into play here, drawing on the chaos principle, with some of these channels emergeing and going away. Making them possible is important.</p>

<p>In complexity you see emergence, self-organization, informality and also unpredictability. You have loosely coupled networks of self-organizing actors. You do not tell people what to do, but presume them to be intelligent, continuously learning and modifying their behaviour dependent on the feedback they get. The direction must be clear though.</p>

<p>What is the implication of all of this? Metaphors often reflect the values of those that selected them. There is a strong relationship between what we think and what we do and metaphors help in connecting the two.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Management Metaphors&lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>These are also common, and often based around team sports these days. Others are warlike or spiritual metaphors. We started out as seeing management as a captain, while leaning more towards the idea of a coach these days. An author, jazz musician or potter are other metaphors found.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Paradigms&lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>When a school of thought hardens, it becomes a paradigm, an assumption that isn&#8217;t questioned. The functionalist paradigm sees our world as orderly and understandable, with the organisations having specific goals. The interpretative paradigm sees it as a social relationship. Westerners favor rational analysis and focus on the task. Now we are starting to put more emphasis on the relationship and enterpreneurial forms of managment put more focus on the powers of perception rather than analysis. Firms are decentralizing, going into cells, boundaries moving or going away and more holistic analysis is taking place. A paradigm shift seems to be happening that is not easy.</p>
