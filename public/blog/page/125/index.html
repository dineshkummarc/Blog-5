  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyone and their friends seem to be linking to the following article, and I thought I shouldn&#8217;t but now I read it and I can&#8217;t make myself not link to it. This is really good. For one, he also says, like several people already did to me, that ASP.NET is a really nice programming language. But the more interesting parts are the argument that Microsoft is loosing its grip on software developers.</p>

<p>Check this: &lt;I&gt;A lot of the bets Microsoft made are the wrong ones. For example, WinFS, advertised as a way to make searching work by making the file system be a relational database, ignores the fact that the real way to make searching work is by making searching work. Don&#8217;t make me type metadata for all my files that I can search using a query language. Just do me a favor and search the damned hard drive, quickly, for the string I typed, using full-text indexes and other technologies that were boring in 1973.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>And for the power of the web: &lt;I&gt;So the Web user interface is about 80% there, and even without new web browsers we can probably get 95% there. This is Good Enough for most people and it&#8217;s certainly good enough for developers, who have voted to develop almost every significant new application as a web application.</p>

<p>Which means, suddenly, Microsoft&#8217;s API doesn&#8217;t matter so much. Web applications don&#8217;t require Windows.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a long article but worth the read. Check it out: &lt;a title=&quot;Joel on Software - How Microsoft Lost the API War&quot; href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html&quot;&gt;Joel on Software - How Microsoft Lost the API War&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: Great discussion going on over at Jeremy&#8217;s Ensight.org. &lt;a&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt;!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Russell Beattie has a very good post about Nokia&#8217;s latest announcements entitled: <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1007881.html">Nokia: Innovate On the Inside</a>. I highly suggest you read it as he is a pro in relation to what Nokia does and doesn&#8217;t do and I also have to say that I can very much agree to his views.</p>

<p>Nokia has a huge number of different phones, but very few that are really any good. Their feature mix in the phones, trying to fit the features to the target audience, is very nice, but I agree with Russell that in some cases you wonder if an additional MP3 player would have been so bad. I mean they had MP3 players in their phones before the 6600 and would it really have made the phone that much more expensive in production to add one?</p>

<p>I really believe that Nokia is focussing too much on two things: Margin and Platform. They are removing everything that is not needed, to increase margin. They are bringing out lots of different phones which are essentially the same because they can. Still, at this time I would not be sure which phone to recommend to somebody. Most of just something missing. The 6230 is moving in the right direction again. What they still need is a nice entry level phone with a <em>good</em> camera in it, plus MMS and the possibility to get the images off without needing to send them per eMail. Then just make it look like a phone, as Russell says, and you have a winner. We are still in a features war. Yes, phones are also fashion objects, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we want round key pads. Function first people. Function first.</p>

<p>I am still holding on to my shares though because I still believe that Nokia is amazingly well placed for the future in wireless.</p>

<p>Users of the free Yahoo! Mail now have 100MB and pay users have 2 GB! Woohoooo! Sooner or later they will just say &quot;unlimited&quot; because who the hell gets more than a few MB of mail anyway, or rather keeps them!? Very few people I&#8217;d say.</p>

<p>I just want Google to allow me to put photos in my storage too and link to them as well. That would make me even happier about GMail and all things Google.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you want to know what is happening in the mobile space and also what Nokia is doing there, I highly suggest listening to the feeds from <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,6771,58956,00.html">Nokia Connection 2004</a>. What strikes me as interesting is that Nokia people sound more edgy in the presentations, more nervous if you want. There is less calm and less excitedness at the same time. You don&#8217;t feel any real confidence anymore. I still think they are on the right track, and they are best positioned to reap the benefits of the move to a more mobile world, but hey, what do I know? ;)</p>

<p>Anway. Another exciting part is that in the second bit, that started at 1300, you can hear a speach by <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joi</a> who talks a bit about mobility, interesting the user, changes in advertising and content. Very nice indeed. I actually have to admit that it made me understand why he invested and works at Six Apart and Technorati. If all he says is true, which seems at least likely, then these kinds of pages will be at the center of attention for a lot of users. Or rather, blogs will and Technorati will help building the possibility for interaction for marketers of the future. Very interesting indeed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In his article <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/83/mbamenace.html">The MBA Menace</a>, Henry Mintzberg is <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/05/teaching_leader.html">at it again</a>, going on about how bad current fulltime MBA programs really are.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;The truth is, no one can become a manager in a classroom. Management is not a profession, nor is it science. It is a practice that depends mostly on craft and significantly on art. &lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>First, I agree. Second, he has a bit of an inside agenda because his newest course isn&#8217;t full time and largely about sharing experiences. But still, this made me very happy again that my MBA course is part-time, with full work schedule, which links practice and theory very nicely indeed. This is actually why I agree with him. This mix is very good both for learning and for practice. It gives you the best of both worlds and allows you to keep your feets firmly on your ground.</p>
