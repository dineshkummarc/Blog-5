  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jeremy posted a question: &lt;a title=&quot;Google Hoarding the Pie?&quot; href=&quot;http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/004137.html&quot;&gt;Google Hoarding the Pie?&lt;/a&gt;. The question posed there is why Google&#8217;s TAC (Traffic Acquisition Costs) have gone down quarter over quarter and Jeremy wonders if the are slowly decreasing the unpublished revenue share given to standard AdSense users.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t believe this to be the case. First of all, if you are one of the big publishers you will get a fixed and negotiable % share from Google. It&#8217;s only the small AdSense sites that do not know what their share is and I presume that this has been left the same the entire time. The decrease of TAC as a % of Network Revenue likely comes from optimization work and lots of deals with fixed prices either per month or CPM based.</p>

<p>Here is an example. If they came out +/-0 in profit in a CPM deal in previous months, it might be that they now make a few cents in profit CPM based and hence their % of TAC decreases naturally. That&#8217;s why it is so important for them to continue to work on optimization of the ads. That&#8217;s money cash in the bank.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say they have 1 Billion Banner Ad Impressions per Month bought CPM based at $1 CPM (just to keep the numbers simple). They are not running a profit. The $1.000.000 go in and out per month without a dime in profit. They have an average CTR of 1 and CPC of 1 (again to keep it simple) and now work on their contextual fit, design, better rotation, larger inventory&#8230; . Now they manage to increase their CTR by 10% and their CPC by 10% over the entire network of CPM buys. Now they suddenly make $1.210.000 per month on the same costs.</p>

<p>Of course those numbers are a little bit too high, but I think it gets the point across. A decrease in TAC from 80% to 77% can be contributed to simple improvements of CPC and CTR in relation to fixed deals they likely have.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s also where their large increase in profits came from by the way. At least to a big part.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you didn&#8217;t read Cringely&#8217;s article about the iPod and Mac Mini then now is the time. He includes a quote that is about something that I have often said to friends that complained when I sit in front of the PC too long. I am not sitting in front of the PC, as a thing. I am doing things and the PC is the enabler.  This is maybe why I like the mac so much, as it keeps the hassle of the hardware and is a more trustworthy enabler. Check this:</p>

<p>&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20050127.html&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As for Apple being in the content business, let me offer a comparison. In the 1970s, Motorola used to tell people it sold technology. You talked to any of the SPS engineers, production control managers, marketing people, etc., at their facilities and operations in Phoenix, and they would say that &#8216;we make and sell technology.&#8217; But between 1978 and 1982 they stopped saying that. They began to say &#8216;we provide the technology.&#8217; That subtle shift in language reflected a change order of magnitude. Technology migrated from being a product to being the process (an enabler) by which things happened&#8230;. It seems to me that Apple is now making that shift. They appear to recognize that digital or electronic technology is no longer a product but a process, an enabler of activities rather than the activity itself. When I bought my first computer, I was buying a computer. Sure I wanted to write programs to do things, and use software that did things, but fundamentally I was buying a product that was about the product.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I recently purchased a Sony Vaio with a tuner built into it. I wasn&#8217;t buying a computer, I was buying an entertainment appliance for the kitchen. I wanted an appliance that I could use to watch TV, play games, surf the net, have the kids do homework on and be in a common area. That&#8217;s why I think you are right about the Mini. I suspect Apple will add whatever connectivity they need for I/O, be it opto audio or wi-fi audio. But that box is an appliance, not a computer. Or at least it has the true potential to be. And in the digital world, that puts them into the content business, because digital appliances are about content just as kitchen appliances are about food&#8230;. And it comes in white.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>All this is why we will not see a G5 Powerbook anytime soon for example. Apple is not playing the Ghz games, they don&#8217;t really need to have the highest number there. It&#8217;s about the full experience and about building something that gives me what I want. People that guy Apple hardware have understood that it&#8217;s not about some numbers (bigger harddrive, more RAM, more Ghz, bigger screen, &#8230;), but about finding something that fits best to their wants and needs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, yes, yes and yes. Check out <a href="http://majestic.typepad.com/seth/2005/02/false_profits_i.html">this post on Transparent Bundles</a>. I&#8217;ll simply quote:</p>

<p>&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://majestic.typepad.com/seth/2005/02/false_profits_i.html&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future of Internet advertising is sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>Oh so true. I touched upon it <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/01/cpm_rss_and_the.html">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/01/internet_your_l.html">here</a>. This internet thing is a city and buildings don&#8217;t run on CPM advertising either, they run on sales. Portals will too. And that doesn&#8217;t mean that the entire sales process happens online. Some processes might just be mapped more efficiently offline.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;If you thought selling shoes online doesn&#8217;t work, then check out <a href="http://www.zappos.com/">Zappos.com</a>. SiliconBeat just posted a story that <a href="http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2005/02/03/zapposcom_makes_it_look_easy.html">Zappos.com makes it look easy</a> which is true indeed. Just check out their latest revenue numbers:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2005/02/03/zapposcom_makes_it_look_easy.html&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;1999: Almost nothing&lt;br /&gt;
2000: $ 1.6 mm&lt;br /&gt;
2001: $ 8.6 mm&lt;br /&gt;
2002: $ 32 mm&lt;br /&gt;
2003: $ 70 mm&lt;br /&gt;
2004: $184 mm&lt;br /&gt;
2005: $300 mm (goal)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Not bad ey? And they went from 5 employees to 1000 by the end of the year. Boy oh boy. Not bad. So much for selling shoes, and now handbags, online. Congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;[Original story here: <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/who_the_hell_is.html">Who the hell is Gasoil Inc</a>]&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I might have a solution for the questions around that company. Of course only those that set up the company can know for sure, but I now have two different people telling me something very similar and I believe it. First of all this is really a company set up in agreement with the underwriters of the IPO to allow the founders to sell a little bit of shares. Obviously the banks want the company to sell stock, because that puts money in the hands of the company, but sometimes the founders or key staff want to get a little bit of cash for buying a Ferrari too, which is where this kind of stuff comes from. This kind of stuff seems to be very common around IPOs and is just how it is.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A bit more information came to me via Serge Faguet (he commented on this blog) who did some research on Venture Capital and IPOs at Cornell and also asked a Professor who teaches IPOs at the business school. Based on his information, or guess however you want to put it, Gasoil Inc is &lt;em&gt;a 10b5-1 plan set up to sell stock by insiders every month on a predetermined schedule&lt;/em&gt;. That way there is no insider problem as the insiders are not selling themselves. So we will likely see more sales of Gasoil Inc shares in the future on some standard day. Maybe every 6 months, maybe every year. We will see. They don&#8217;t seem to be selling too much via the setup, but it&#8217;s still a bit weird, &#8230; but fully legal and ok with all the key people. :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First posted, then pulled and now reposted, is the three part story by Rony Abovitz, CTO of <a href="http://www.z-kat.com/">z-kat</a>. I had read the original posting, loved it and am happy that it is back. It&#8217;s a satirical piece that somehow seems to get across the wild emotional ride that unprepared visitors will have to live with. Here are some excerpts and the links.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.forumblog.org/blog/2005/02/through_the_loo.html">Through the looking glass Pt. 1</a>: &lt;I&gt;[&#8230;] I find myself in a heated discussion on human consciousness, babbling on about living robots and mysticism and all sorts of California kinds of things. Robotic frogs. Of course! Yes, it is a dream because Sharon Stone is sitting behind me, talking to her agent and nodding when the Buddhist Monk talks about reaching the ninth level of understanding in the 500th lifetime. Getting pretty wierd now. I am in an argument with some British Dutchess who is also a professor at Oxford or some such thing and who speaks ten times faster than a normal person. She speaks so fast that I almost expect her head to spin a 360. Is that the Prime Minister of India? Pakistan? The CEO of Infosys? A soft pillow is a clear conscience. [&#8230;]&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Then on he goes in <a href="http://www.forumblog.org/blog/2005/02/through_the_loo_1.html">Through the Looking Glass Pt. II</a>: &lt;I&gt;[&#8230;] Muppet velociraptors, hunting in pairs, killing you with their utter Googleness. They really are Google. They just ooze utter Googleness. It&#8217;s a shiny, happy place in GoogleLand, and all of the rules have changed. They gave me that hey dude, we know you hacked your way in too, but we found the cheat code book. We are so far ahead its sick. And we&#8217;re holding back like, so much. We&#8217;re the new dungeonmasters, the new sysops. This is like the ultimate video game and they won and now they own the arcade. They have infinite bonus lives, unlimited ammo, and they found the source code and are now building mods as they go. Wozniak, Jobs, Captain Crunch - hackers of the world - the Google guys have smoked you beyond belief. They have hacked in and taken over the kernel, and boy are they having fun. Much respect to the GoogleGuys. [&#8230;]&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>He finishes off with <a href="http://www.forumblog.org/blog/2005/02/through_the_loo_2.html">Through the Looking Glass Pt. III</a>. Here you go for a teaser: &lt;I&gt;[&#8230;] want to go home. I want to go home. And where are you going? My name is Dorothy the girl said, and I am going to the Emerald City, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas. Can I come too? [&#8230;]&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Thanks a lot Rony for the posting. Loved it.</p>
