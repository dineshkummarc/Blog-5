  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am seriously pissed at the moment because this thing has been down for over 30 hours. Seems like my hosting company had some problems with the hardware of the server this is running on. Of course, this can happen and I might just ben unlucky that it happens to me when I signed on just a few weeks ago&#8230; but still it drives me nuts. I will still have to make them give me some free months of service or something. The good side of this, is that they are getting a new quad Xeon system that will host this soon. It&#8217;s a nice system all in all, with me having a virtual server on this box. Ah well&#8230; we will see how it goes.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s simply amazing. I am truely wondering what they are smoking over there. An ally seems to mean that you have to say what the other says, no matter what you think is right. And most of not all of Germany is against a war in Irak without UN support (many are probably against any war period) and Schr√∂der did not loose because he was going the way he does in the Irak question. He has lost, or rather his party has lost, the election because there is high unemployment and other problems in germany.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have just been snowboarding for the second time in my life. The last time was some 14 years ago if I am not mistaken but this time was the first time that I could translate what was told to me back then. You might wonder where I have been snowboarding. Well, at the <a href="http://www.alpincenter.com/">Alpincenter</a> in Bottrop. It&#8217;s an indoor ski thingie and for beginners it&#8217;s a lot of fun. I was there with 7 friends and many of us tried out new things. If you can really ski, then the track is probably not too much fun, still enjoyable but just not chalenging. But if you are just starting or are trying to freshen up your old knowledge, go for it. At the end of the evening it actually went pretty well. My main problem became especially clear at one time though. I can turn right a lot better than left (my left foot is downhill) and then somebody was skying to my right &#8230; and he was exactly my speed &#8230; he didn&#8217;t go any faster, or slower than me &#8230; I was getting faster &#8230; so was he &#8230; and I didn&#8217;t know what to do &#8230; in the end I could brake but it was becoming too fast for me perference. I also was persuaded to try a small jump once and the jump was good, but afterwards I was again fairly fast and then you are just thinking &quot;Don&#8217;t get the wrong curve into the snow &#8230; Don&#8217;t get the wrong curve into the snow &#8230;&quot; ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>German has often been said to not have a real service culture and sometimes this might even be correct from time to time. The biggest problem to a starting german service culture is TV though. Here, we have this wonderful idea that we should test out how customer friendly german companies really are. Will they take back worn underwear? Will they take back meet that has been cooked for 20 minutes? This is nuts! They will obviously do it because they think it is right. The TV station probably tries to find somebody that does it until they do, and then they tell them they did wrong, based on the knowledge of some &quot;consultant.&quot;</p>

<p>This solves nothing though. It&#8217;s not like they get a free course on how to be customer friendly and where good service ends. They still have to do it or their potential customers will move elsewhere, or so they believe.  Now, thanks to those TV shows, lots of people will run arround try to exploit that and soon the entire service culture will be dead again. Wonderful. Totally stupid.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just saw <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0264464">Catch me if you can</a> and I had a great time. Wonderful movie I have to say. It was just the right mix of fun, existing, good characters and interesting story. I am not sure at this time but if this is really a true story then it is a very cool story.</p>

<p>In a related note, I finally managed to clear up all my bills and things for last year and generally got a little bit of order into my things. A very productive weekend, including helping a friend move.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been a member of <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/main">Google Answers</a> for some time now but sadly I did not have the time to give a lot of answers in my time as a researcher. I should probably take a look again and see if there is something where I can help. Why do I post this? Google just sent a check for the commission I got on the two answers I gave. $3.38. Not that I can do anything with it, as cashing it in would probably cost me more than $5, but it&#8217;s great to see that they care and send over that amount of money. I actually like the service. You go in, ask a question, and lots of interesting people will give you an answer. These researchers can be rated similar to how it works on eBay. All in all an interesting system.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just returned from a speech by Lutz Hackenberg of the <a href="http://www.agd.de/">AGD</a>. He was talking about how to get, hold, talk to, understand, &#8230; customers. He was actually very confincing and it was a good learning experience even though this was more or less geared towards designers. Some interesting things follow.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The entire speech was done with a good amount of jokes and funny anecdotes which made the 2 and a half hours go over pretty fast. The first thing, where I have to agree fully is that you need to achieve three things:&lt;br /&gt;
- I exist
&lt;br /&gt;- This is what you get from me
&lt;br /&gt;- This is why this is important for you
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this sounds simple enough, it is very true and important to understand when trying to get a customer to give you money, in a sense to get somebody to be your customer. There were lots of little details that were important to remember. For example how to write a letter to the customer, what to say and what not to say or to ask for a meeting and if you ask for a meeting, have a time ready. The other side does not want to think about when they could possibly meet you. Give them some suggestions, help them out. The problem would also be that if you say that you can meet them whenever they like, then they could just say &quot;Sunday before church at 7 would be good.&quot; Now what. This actually reminded me of one book which I read where the writer always said to say that you&#8217;d like it one hour earlier. Presuming your potential customer says that friday at 9 am would be good, knowing that you are coming by train, then you should say, &quot;8 would be better.&quot;, just to show them that you really want to meet them and you are happy to get up at 4 am to do that. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Another important point that was actually addresses, even though I missed the emphasis on it, was customer focus. Know what your potential customer needs. Another small thing, that I am not too sure about yet though, is that you should never say that you are not there at the moment on an answering machine or something, but rather that you are doing something, traveling, some general term for being active. When you contact potentials, contact 10 people max and call them three days later. Once you get a meeting, be very prepared and try to create a positive climate. If you do not get a direct meeting after placing your call, ask when you can call again. In your letter, actually say &quot;Could I call you in the next few days?&quot; &#8230; this is where I am really not sure though if that is so good. His point was that nobody will mail you back or call you and say no, so you already have the agreement kind of. If you end with your letter like this, then I think it needs to be amphasised that it&#8217;s not about generally calling but about &quot;in the next few days&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There were actually lots more small things that are good and I will try to keep them in my head when I am continuing to attract new customers. In general though, I believe that you need to get experience in this. There are so many little details that you will surely get a lot of them wrong at first. Over time you will make less and less mistakes and be confronted with less and less unexpected events. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
