  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a new organisation in town. <a href="http://www.sendthemback.org/">Sendthemback.org</a> is arguing that we are stealing MP3s and stealing is wrong. The say that while we think we simply share music, this is nothing else than shoplifting and piracy. &quot;No more! It&#8217;s time to make it right by giving back what we stole!&quot; What did they do? They sent back all the MP3&#8217;s they illegally downloaded, either:
- as file attachments in e-mails
- burn them on cd and send them back
- make the MP3s into text and then
-&gt; snail mail
-&gt; or fax them</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.heise.de/tp/deutsch/inhalt/glosse/16123/1.html">this article</a> on Telepolis points out, you can find out where to send your MP3s right <a href="http://www.ifpi.de/">here if you are in Germany</a>. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nokia today has their Nokia Capital Markets Day, which you can follow <a href="http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=NOK&amp;amp;script=1010&amp;amp;item_id=807318">here</a>. Below is a bit of a summary for the interesting tidbits. :)</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/webcast/2003/nov03/Nokia/PPT/OpeningRemarks.pdf">opening remarks</a> Jorma Ollila points out the sources of competitive advantage of Nokia being: Products; Brand; Sourcing, logistics and manufacturing; Technology; Economies of scale; Software&#8230;. An interesting mix, even though I am not sure many of them qualify as a sustainable competitive advantage. They serve best at showing what Nokia wants to focus on in the future.</p>

<p>In the slides on <a href="http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/webcast/2003/nov03/Nokia/PPT/DefiningTechLeadership.pdf">Defining Tech Leadership</a>, presented by Pertti Korhonen, the Nokia CTO, there is an explanation on why the platform idea is so important for Nokia. They show the definition of platform giving as an example the VW Gold, Audi A3, Seat Leon and Skoda Fabia, all four cars built on the same basic platform.</p>

<p>It also shows that the latest Series 60 device, based on Symbian 7, the 6600, will be good for operator branding as it has a skinnable version of Series 60, meaning that Vodafone could simply ship it with a Vodafone Live! skin and hence look at feel. With this, Nokia at least gives in half way to operators who want to push their own brand. It also details that the biggest part by a big margin of Nokia&#8217;s R&amp;D spending is on Software.</p>

<p>Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo talks about <a href="http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/webcast/2003/nov03/Nokia/PPT/ExpandingMobileVoice.pdf">Expanding Mobile Voice</a>. Here you see a direct comparison of Nokia and Dell, where Nokia actually looks fairly good. With only 2/3rd of the sales, but an almost 3times higher operating margin, Nokia&#8217;s operating cashflow is slightly bigger than that of Dell. The big difference is Nokia&#8217;s 24 and Dell&#8217;s 4 days of inventory, which is actually what makes Dell so amazing and where people have higher hopes for an opportunity for moving into other product lines is for Dell, where it is not for Nokia. Then there is the negative cash conversion cycle, -43 for Dell and -79 for Nokia, meaning that they are actually paying for their products 79 days after they sold them.  Interestingly enough, Net working capital is a big minus for both of them, meaning that their currently liabilities are bigger than their current assets, which isn&#8217;t the best thing to have when a lot of people suddenly want money from you, but this is unlikely to happen to Nokia. It actually means that inventory and receivables are financed by suppliers and customers, without paying interest. How cool is that ey? ;)</p>

<p>Nokia is actually working hard to get the inventory days down though, just to get that one out of the way.</p>

<p><a href="http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/webcast/2003/nov03/Nokia/PPT/Drivingconsumermultimedia.pdf">Driving consumer multimedia</a> starts talking about the brand and shows that branding is a very long term project for Nokia. Then an interesting fact: Volumes of camera phones exceeded volumes of digital cameras in Q2 2003 and Nokia is today the world&#8217;s biggest camera manufacturer!!! :)</p>

<p>Then there are some interesting observations with this, for one, that the megapixel race is over and you now need to focus on picture quality, which is oh so true. Megapixel cameras should come in 2004 and they are pushing their cooperations with Kodak and HP here.</p>

<p>As for media, Nokia has a business unit that is already licensing content it seems and they will distribute among others on MMC card (get your act together with where you put the MMC card slot damn it!!!).</p>

<p>The N-Gage will have 100 titles by the end of 2004. They are in it for the long run and people will need to understand that.</p>

<p>As for the operator problem, being that they want to push their own brand, here are Nokia&#8217;s answers, what Nokia brings:
&lt;I&gt;
- World class brand - creates consumer pull
- Easy of use - enables higher ARPU
- High quality - less need for customer service
- Enabling operator differentiation&lt;/I&gt; (see the skinnability of 6600 above)
&lt;I&gt;- Wide product range
- Have the best support resources
- Best partner for end to end data services market
&lt;/i&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is another interesting thing that the web enables. Michael Jackson has set up (or rather made set up ;)) <a href="http://www.mjnews.us/">this site</a> which he will use for public statements. In a sense, it allows him to keep the spin the media puts on his court case at least a little bit in control. He cannot control what is said, but he can at least make sure that what he says is heard and not twisted arround in any way.</p>

<p>The idea is also good for corporations and other institutions who can publish full interviews of their employees to allow readers of excerpts to read the entire thing before making up their mind on the basis of what the publishing organe chose to print.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well what do we have here today? Is it Google is evil day? It all started when I visited John Battelle&#8217;s <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/000092.php">post</a> about <a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/print/0,15935,548765,00.html">this Fortune article</a>. The Fortune article is actually very good, telling some juicy tidbits about Google:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;When the numbers pertain to Google, they look very, very good. In 18 months the company has quadrupled in size, now employing more than 1,300 people. Annualized revenues have sextupled, to about $900 million. Annualized pretax profits have grown by a factor of 23, to about $350 million, according to a handful of people who have been told the figures. Only a few high-tech companies in history, like Apple, Compaq, Sun, and more recently Amazon.com, have generated that kind of revenue growth so fast. None has made as much money doing it—not even Netscape, which grew faster than Google has but made money in only one of its years.
[&#8230;]
 We&#8217;ll sing more of Google&#8217;s praises later, but first the worrisome news: Google has grown arrogant, making some of its executives as frustrating to deal with in negotiations as AOL&#8217;s cowboy salesmen during the bubble. It has grown so fast that employees and business partners are often confused about who does what. A rise of stock- and option-stoked greed is creating rifts within the company. Employees carp that Google is morphing in strange and nerve-racking ways. And talk swirls over the question of who&#8217;s really in charge: CEO Schmidt or co-founders Brin and Page? &lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Read it, it&#8217;s good. But Fortune is not alone, as the <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2003/11/24/as_google_grows_critics_emerge/">Boston Globe has another article on EvilGoogle</a>.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;&quot;Google is about to join, I think, that rarified level enjoyed by Microsoft, the New York Yankees, the United States of America,&quot; said Hayson [Editor of Watching Google like a hawk]. &quot;Too big, too powerful, too successful, too rich. And you&#8217;re starting to see the rumblings right now.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>And while I am at it, check out <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/today.html">10 things that Google has found to be true</a> and <a href="http://images.fastcompany.com/blog/googledo.pdf">What should Google do?</a> as edited by Seth Godin.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is some good news from Overture and Google. If you are running <a href="http://adwords.google.com/">Google AdWords</a>, you will be happy to know that you can now put several ads in one campaign and they will be auto-optimized for Click-Through. I am currently still doing that by hand but there is also another problem with this. This is optimization for Google, not for the advertiser. The thing is that if you place an ad that has a high click-through and one that has all the necessary information in it, the better clicked one will be shown more but might have a much worse conversion ratio after the click. I&#8217;d actually like to see Google optimize on Leads for people using their Conversion Tracker.</p>

<p>The other news is rather old, but I finally found the page. Overture&#8217;s <a href="http://www.content.overture.com/d/USm/ays/mc.jhtml">Marketing Console</a> will allow you to track any online advertising campaigns and the pricing is very interesting as it is based on leads on your site and starts at $150 per month. I am very interested indeed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;(comment: As originally posted on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Here we look at portfolio theory, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the dividend valuation model.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio Theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In general, the annual percentage return of a stock is calculated by:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The risk is calculated by looking at the variations of returns over several periods, which is the standard deviation of the measurements. Portfolio theory states that a mix of several investments will hold a smaller risk than their mean or weighted average risk. This is due to the less than perfect correlation between the movements in value of both investments. In case of stock A and B, they will fluctuate less in value together as one might go up while the other goes down or even only less up. The risk is calculated via the portfolio equation:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;375&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;80&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Portfolio Equation&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/portfolio_equation.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To look at the portfolio with the least risk you employ some mathematical wizardry. First you find that W(y) = 1 - W(x) and replace W(y) with the right side of that equation. Then you differentiate the Portfolio Equation with respect to W(x) and then equate that to 0. When you solve that equation, you will have a turning point in the slope of the equation. This gives us:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;343&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;57&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Minimal Risk&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/minimal_risk.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;where Var(R(p)) = S(p)<sup>2&lt;/p&gt;</sup></p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In a multi-asset portfolio the entire formula becomes:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;276&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;73&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-Asset Portfolio&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/multi-asset_portfolio.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;If you would plot a graph with your different potential mixes of investments, you will find that there is an opportunity set of investments and this graph has something called the efficient frontier. This is where there is the least risk for the chosen return. We can use that graph to find the optimal mix of a risk free investment and a mix of stocks by putting the tangent on the efficient frontier and then choosing a mix of the touching point and the risk free investment that will give us our wanted risk. This line is the capital market line.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This allows us to easily find a portfolio mixing risk-free investments and a given portfolio with a given risk ( m stands for shares and f for the risk-free asset).&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;304&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;45&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Expected Portfolio Return&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/expected_portfolio_return.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Here we have been considering a market portfolio against a risk-free investment. This entire system can also be used to analyse individual shares in relation to the market portfolio (CAPM). Here we find two things. First of all, the beta of the share, meaning the fluctuation of the shares against the flucuation of the market portfolio. With the help of that we can find out what the risk of the share is in relation to the market risk taking into account the risk free investment.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;265&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;113&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;beta&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/beta.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Another item that is important when investing in stocks are the dividends. One way to value them is to simply discount them to get their current value. The other method is the &lt;strong&gt;Gordon growth model&lt;/strong&gt;, which can be used if the dividends are growing by a constant percentage each year.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;176&quot; height=&quot;67&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;gordon_growth_model.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/gordon_growth_model.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Where P is the price of the shares, D(1) the dividend after one year, E the expected rate of return and g the growth rate of the dividend.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Next stop: &lt;strong&gt;Bonds&lt;/strong&gt;, starting with some definitions:
- basic coupon yield or current yield: is only about the coupon rate / price
- coupon rate: fixed interest rate as a percentage of par (or nominal or face value)
- par, nominal or face value: the quoted value independent of the current market value of the bond
- adjusted coupon yield: recognizes any redemption payment, apportioned in a straight-line basis
- yield to maturity: IRR of the bond&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Another item is the duration of bonds, which is the accumulated present value of cash flows occuring at each time period of the bond.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;197&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;77&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Duration of Bonds&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/duration.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Moving stuff around in this equation we get this:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;219&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;74&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Duration of Bonds&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/duration2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The duration is always less than the maturity, unless it is a zero coupon bond. This duration presumes that as the yield of the bond changes, the price changes too, and that this is happening in a straight line method, which is just not true, something that is known as the convexity of bonds. The convexity of the bond is always to the benefit of the shareholder and a more convex bond is more attractive. This is a highly complicated subject, further reading on the subject of bonds, with great detail, can be found <a href="http://investopedia.com/university/advancedbond/">here</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WACC&lt;/strong&gt; stands for &quot;weighted average cost of capital&quot;, which is used to find a value to discount against in the NPV model. It&#8217;s calculated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;WACC = (Dept / (Dept + Equity))&lt;em&gt;(Cost of Dept)(1 - Corporate tax rate) + (Equity / (Dept + Equity))&lt;/em&gt;Cost of equity&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;When working with foreign exchange, you need to remember that traders will sell foreign exchange at a lower rate than they will buy it, which is called their spread. They will sell low and buy high. There is an interesting spread sheet included on page 151 showing how to go about calculating your sell and buy rates. Then there is also the forward exchange rate, which is an agreement for delivering e.g. $X for â‚¬Y at a future date. These will be quoted in two ways being: forward outright = spot + forward margin&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then there is also a connection between exchange rates, interest rates and inflaction rates summaries as follows.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Purchasing power parity (PPP): (1+ UK expected inflation) / (1+USA expected inflation) = (USD/GBP spot) / (USD/GBP forward)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The fisher effect: (1 + nominal rate) = (1+ real rate) (1+expected inflation rate)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Interest rate partiy theory: (1+UK interest rate) / (1+US interest rate) = (USD/GBP spot) / (USD/GBP forward)
This will be further covered in unit 8, which will explain that market forces will maintain this ballance.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Options are also covered at the end of the section, including black-scholes and other theories, but they are only touched upon and I will not put this here.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
