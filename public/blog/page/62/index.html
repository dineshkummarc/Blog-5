I actually don&#8217;t want to say too much about this book as it will give some things away. Again something nice and easy for the holiday, nothing too special and as the last two books actually bought by Avonia and as I happened to by out of books &#8230; It&#8217;s a very nice read though, with a good plot or rather mix of plots. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0515137111/">Check it out!</a>

I was rather skeptical by this pink book but I have to admit that I laughed my head of from time to time. It&#8217;s a bit surreal with the main character having an alligator that is short sighted and an epileptic. Some might feel it is a bit over the top, others will like the language and simply enjoy a group of females, who write for a porn mag, kill a few people. Light reading but fun. <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3596165881/">Check it out!</a><br/>

A group of 4 people meet on the roof of a house in london on new years eve wanting to kill themselves. They re-shedule to valentines day together. A really wonderful book to read and with Hornby having written the book for About A Boy among others, you can expect something funny and insightful. I can really recommend the book for some light reading: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1573223026/">Check it out!</a>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;
One of the book I read on my holiday was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0874778247/">The End of Work by Jeremy Rifkin</a> and it&#8217;s a great book to start your thinking process. I will try to present you some highlights.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As a backgrounder, the book talks about the problems we will have with too many unemployed people as we are moving into a time when we just don&#8217;t need a lot of people to produce all the world needs. Technology has made that possible and retraining 10 million farmers that sell sugar to become knowledge workers because science has figured out how to build perfect sweeteners in the lab. There are lots of different possibilities, one being that when there are performance improvements, you don&#8217;t fire workers but you let them work less hours for almost the same money.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is actually what France and Belgium are doing and seem to have higher productivity than the US, partly attributed to the higher moral through more flexible working schedules and in terms of France, a 35 hour work week for 39 hour pay supported by the state. The thing is that 75% of the labor force in most industrial countries perform some form of repetitive task and these people can be replaced by thinking machines like the horse was replaced by the tractor. By now it is getting clearer that the loss of jobs in the industrial sector does not come predominantly from moving those jobs overseas, but simply by local automation. That all these unemployed people will suddenly  work in smaller companies is unlikely too with 1% of the US companies employing 41% of the workers in the private sector.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The idea of trickle-down technology, meaning that advances in technology will trickle down and lead to more jobs, have been followed by  lots of heads of state but is now proving to be incorrect. Think of it like this. Efficiency increases make sense, until supply surpasses demand, in which case you cannot produce more with the same amount of people, but produce the same output with fewer people. That is why marketing is so important as it creates the needs and wants that can be filled by oversupply.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In 1890 Herman Hollerith invented a tabulator machine to calculate the U.S. Consensus Bureau&#8217;s consensus data and set up the &quot;Tabulating Machine Company&quot;, which in 1924 became &#8230; IBM! Just a little bit of info that comes from the book that some might not know about. I love stuff like this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Another item&#8230; The black community in the US went from slaves to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=define:+sharecroppers&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8">sharecroppers</a> to industrial unskilled blue-collar workers, the first to be replaced by the automation movement.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The problem partly comes from scientific management principles in which the hierarchy is king and management simply specify the manual labor based on scientific management principles. This can of course be automated. In the knowledge economy, just to add a point from my side, this doesn&#8217;t work anymore as the knowledge is being created at the bottom, which should probably change to be the top. Management then becomes, as Tom Peters said, Barrier Removal Professionals.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Japanese introduced &quot;kaizen&quot; to the factory, meaning continuous improvement. I did ask myself in the book why we need release cycles in software management if a factory can practically  work without it, at least for smaller problems. But back to the point, in Japan, all have the right to access all computerized information. It&#8217;s very open. They have been taking it to extremes really, like Japan&#8217;s National Bicycle Company. They measure you in a shop, tailor your bike, and let you choose each part. This is then sent electronically to the factory and can be shipped to you in under three hours!!! They now delay this for a week because people want the &quot;joy of anticipation&quot;. :)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here is an example of where this is leading. In 1950, 50% of the US workforce was in farming. Today (1993) this is 2.7%. Research seems to point to the fully automated farm to be 20 years in the future, so 2013. There is a better statistic for why the trickle-down technology theory is untrue though. This can be found in the average weekly wage in the US. In 1979 this was $387, but in 1989 it was $335! In 1989, 1% of US families earned 14.1% of the total income, had 38.3% of the total net worth and 50.3% of the net financial assets. The net worth of the 834000 richest families was $5.62 trillion in 1993, while the bottom 90% had $4.8 trillion!!!
&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590595009">The Best of Software Writing</a> by Joel Spolsky was the first book that I read during the holiday and it rocks. The book is really just a collection of blog posts that are put together to show what good writing on software is all about. Some examples follow:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Michael Bean wrote about <a href="http://www.forio.com/outsourcing.htm">the pitfalls of outsourcing programmers</a> and it&#8217;s a wonderful article that I would have loved to have handy some time ago. It did leave me with the idea that outsourcing IT is really an all or nothing approach and then you need to decide about your product development and other stuff too. Even if you see yourself only remotely as an IT shop, don&#8217;t outsource your coding artists.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Adam Bosworth&#8217;s <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000031.html">ISCOC04 Talk</a> post is a wonderful thing to read. He says that for a design and architecture to be successful, it need to be simple. He does cite some examples. He believes that the good thing about Web 2.0 is that it enables new ways for us to get rid of information overload and he believes that: &quot;The currency of reputation and judgement is the answer to the tragedy of the commons, it it will find a way.&quot; He believes machine learning, inference and data mining will become very important. But hey, he&#8217;s a main Google guy, so what do you expect ;)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Danah Boyd <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/Supernova2004.html">argues</a> that users don&#8217;t use services or software for what they are designed for but rather for something that  they think is worthy of their time and you need to keep your app flexible enough to allow for that. You don&#8217;t know what users want!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Bruce Eckel&#8217;s post is about <a href="http://mindview.net/WebLog/log-0025">strong typing vs. strong testing</a>. He does a lot in python at the moment which isn&#8217;t strong typing. He does argue that you need testing in any case and that means that you should just have a very strong test environment and use a less strict language for a lot of cases.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Paul Graham writes about <a href="http://paulgraham.com/gh.html">Great Hackers</a> and  that one is really wonderful to read. He argues that there is a great variety in productivity between coders and you cannot let that productivity be dragged down to the mainstream. You need to understand them and here are some of his ideas about great hackers:
&lt;br /&gt;- they love to code
&lt;br /&gt;- they are only attracted by money because with lots of it you can do what you want. If you can do what you want with good money that&#8217;s ok too.
&lt;br /&gt;- they want open source stuff because they can control and fix it themselves
&lt;br /&gt;- they need an office similar to their home, with a couch and doors so they can relax
&lt;br /&gt;- they need something interesting but hey, you can make it interesting and very demanding. It&#8217;s your demand that counts.
&lt;br /&gt;- for a share in a company Einstein seems to have worked on building refrigerators, but I didn&#8217;t check that.
&lt;br /&gt;- They need big problems
&lt;br /&gt;- they do tend to come in groups and work better in groups and, my own words here, 1+1 tends to make 3 and 1+0.5 = 0.5. So you need big guns together
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Another one, entitled How many Microsoft Employees does it take to change a lightbulb by Eric Lippert is wonderful to read! And yes, it is not a joke! It does take A LOT of people to change something small, and that means it <em>does take</em>. :)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There are lots of other ones that are a real must read but I will let you buy the book and take it with you on a holiday. I know you will not be able to do without IT the entire time but leave everything else at home. This one will make you think a lot. I for one will subscribe to <a href="http://www.randsinresponse.com/">randsinresponse.com</a> and send a few other ones around. Great stuff! Buy the book!

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Obviously I had lots of time to think during the holiday, with no phones, no internet, no TV, no newspapers, nothing. Tranquility. But I did have things to read, which will fill a few posts now. :) For one I read the latest <a href="http://www.brandeins.de/">brand eins</a>, being on communication. The article in question is actually <a href="https://www.brandeins.de/home/inhalt_detail.asp?id=1734&amp;amp;MenuID=8&amp;amp;MagID=64&amp;amp;sid=su21319624350451285">available online</a>. So here comes a few of my own thoughts inspired by those by Wolf Lotter, who wrote the article, and a great one at that.</p>

<p>For one he argues that companies often are already honest and that often we can&#8217;t cope because that honesty is very open and frank. Additionally, in my mind, the honesty is relatively shallow though, which is why blogs partly work because over time they give a deeper picture. This shallowness comes from the fact that these people are  really only communicating bull, pseudo-values, leading to the problem that we stopped trusting them. The people talking to the press are trained to sound honest, knowing that they can&#8217;t be honest. But the thing is that being and acting is different. The article quotes an example where Deutsche Bank frankly and openly said that they need to let go 1960 people (ok, maybe still communicated a bit badly, but honest, in a shallow way). The thing is that Deutsche Bank couldn&#8217;t have really been honest because it would mean saying something like: &quot;We need to fire 1960 people as a good sign to our shareholders, to make us look tough. Additionally, we frankly just don&#8217;t need them anymore because IT enabled us to do more with less.&quot; But you really can&#8217;t do that. Or can you?</p>

<p>Communication means sharing the author of the article statees, which in his mind means that you need two sides, a kind of feedback loop. The communication problem here can be very well seen in product development though. You have people working together that don&#8217;t really talk teh same language and marketing, without deep IT knowledge possibly, tries to make everything sound grand and big and push out the marketing message that will then be &quot;true&quot;. This is a real problem, especially if your product is isn&#8217;t worth buying!</p>

<p>Another item that is interesting to note, that I tend to agree with, is that communication means that you need to really know what you want to communicate before. That&#8217;s not as easy as it sounds. Politicians might not have a solution for our problems, so they spam us dead with details. The problem is not knowing where you want to go.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s really what will become more and more important. You as a company need to be very sure what you are about and where you are going, what your goals are, what your vision (yeah, mission and values and such I know ;)) is. With that in mind you need to be brutally honest. That might be hard for shareholders to swallow but companies will fare better with that. If a waiter in a restaurant forgets  something (aka makes a small mistake) and simply says sorry and changes the error, would you be happy? Or would you rather have him say: &quot;Based on my notes I have brought you what you asked for.&quot; Honesty is a powerful tool and means you need to say you are sorry and admit mistakes and ask for help! That&#8217;s what good personal relationships build on, why wouldn&#8217;t companies?</p>

We just arrived back from our Africa trip yesterday. One week of Safari in Tanzania followed by one week of beach and relaxation in Zanzibar. It was an amazing honeymoon and we have to thank all our friends who made the trip possible! I already created <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliver/sets/735315/">an Africa set on Flickr</a> for you all to enjoy until I get back to a bit more regular posting. Lots of things to post about and lots of work to do now that I&#8217;m back, with the batteries fully loaded up again. Check out the set:
