  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love what Ricardo Semler is doing, just so we are clear on that one. I suggest you read <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2002/04/book_review_mav.html">Maverick by Ricardo Semler</a>, a great read. But anyone. To start with this article, a short quote from the third line: &lt;i&gt;no one in the company really knows how many people we employ&lt;/i&gt;.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>First the employment and contractual relationships are very complex and second Ricardo believes it is useless information. They have employees, part-time employees, ex-employees, and other people on their premises. Some work for them, some for themsleves. Most on Semco&#8217;s machines. Others on othre machines. It can be frustrating as it is uncontrollable and requires a daily leap of faith and has serious implications for corporate security. It has been working very well for three years.</p>

<p>Ricardo goes on by saying: &lt;I&gt;I think that strategic planning and vision are often barriers to success.&lt;/I&gt; He also believes in responsibility, disputes the value of growth, and doesn&#8217;t think you can measure success in numbers. He doesn&#8217;t govern Semco, owns the capital but not the company and it is run based on three values: employee participation, profit shring, open information systems. They are treating their employees like responsible adults. Participation gives people control of their work, profit sharing gives them a reason to do it better and information tells them what&#8217;s working and what isn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>This also means that they needed to accept democratic decisions they disliked. In general Semco survived because they surrounded themselves with people who look at everything they do and think about doing it better, cheaper, faster or just totally different.</p>

<p>The control part is interesting too. They have six counsellors, each acting as CEO for 6 months. They also do six months budgets and the CEO tenure is shifted 3 months to those budgets. Nobody can relax as everybody will be CEO again soon but at the same time, nobody is responsible on their own.</p>

<p>All meetings are open and optional and those that attend make decisions that those who don&#8217;t may simply have to live with.</p>

<p>Their first principle is the ultimate source of all power, and because of this, it is made available to everyone. The person who knows most about the subject chairs meetings. The second principle is that responsibility for any task belongs to the person who claims it. Third, profit sharing and success-oriented compensation spreads responsibility. People try hard to stay aware of everyone else&#8217;s performance.</p>

<p>Whoever holds the spear is completely in charge of bringing down the mammoth.</p>

<p>They might have to worry about leaks but it&#8217;s a waist of time. First competition comes from companies they never heard of before. Second you don&#8217;t win by knowing the other companies 10-K. Strategic Planning in his mind is useless as he believes that it makes things happen that fly full in the face of reality and opportunity. They found more things bottom up than they could with strategic planning he believes.</p>

<p>We have little control, even less organization and no conventional discipline at all. Yet they build rocket-fuel propellant mixers for satellites.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Argyris believes that major changes programs are rife with inner contradictions. The current advice for promoting organizational change has four steps:
- Define a vision
- Define resulting competitive strategy
- Define the work processes
- Define job requirements</p>

<p>In the end, this means you are defining employee actions from the outside and the resulting behaviour cannot be empowering and liberating. You get a &quot;do your own thing - the way we tell you&quot; system.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>CEOs generally undermine empowerment as they link empowerment with tight job requirements and controlled processes. Argyris argues this does not lead to an environment that is empowering but one that is foolproof. Often champions are appointed but the employee will see that person as somebody who wants to sell the empowerment to them, top down, where they would come themselves if they were internally committed.</p>

<p>Employees have their doubts and commitment can be said to be a psychological survival mechanism. In east germany for example, employees learned to survive by complying. It can then be very threatening to suddenly be asked to be internally commited and no longer controlled from the outside. The longer you have external commitment, the harder it is to move to an internal system. A reward system will also rather create dependency and not empowerment. Empowerment might just be too much work for a lot of people.</p>

<p>Change preferessionals inhibit empowerment in many cases as they have a conflict of interests inherent in empowerment. Once the initial excitement wears down, employees will have problems and when they do, they will want to ask their managers, which is ok, but goes against the idea of empowerment.</p>

<p>When change is started without the limitations of empowerment being recognized.</p>

<time datetime="2004-05-20T14:15:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 20<span>th</span>, 2004</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Amabile argues that creativity is a function of three components: expertise, creative thinking skills, and motivation.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Managing creativity was what Amabile researched and she has found six general categories that are important for the manager.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Challenge
You need to match people with the right assignements, with the perfect stretch. This means you need to know the people and the assignements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freedom
You need to give people the autonomy concerning the means/process but not necessarily the end. In some way I might even argue that some people need to know the end and don&#8217;t want to find it themselves. If you set the goals, you need to make sure that they stay stable or meaningful for a longer period in time, as switching goals kill freedom. Autonomy needs to be really granted, not only in name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resources
You have time and money to consider here. Time pressure can heighten creativity or kill it. Increasing intrinsic motivation through a challenge is good. Fake deadlines help noone and create distrust. What are the funds a team needs to complete their assignement. Adding more resources above what is sufficient will not boost creativity (Comment: depends on definition of sufficient). But keeping resources too tight means people&#8217;s creativity goes into finding resources. Creative teams need open and comfortable offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work-group features
You must create mutually supportive groups with diversity of perspectives and backgrounds. Everyone must share the excitement over the team&#8217;s goals and be willing to help each other and recognize the unique knowledge and perspective that everyone brings. You as a manager need to understand their problem-solving styles and their motivational hot buttons. While homogeneous teams reach solutions more quickly they also agree too fast, killing creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supervisory encouragement
To sustain passion people need to feel that their work matters. I would like to extend this to the fact that it needs to matter for something they care about. You need to recognize creative work without offering specific rewards. Remember that ideas must be new and useful but dead ends can end up being enlightening. you might try to serve as a role model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizational support
Creativity flourishes when the entire organization supports it. support does not mean bribing people though. Information sharing and collaboration is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;We now assume that to add value in our developed economies, we need creativity and innovation. We are shifting from an industrial to the information age with higher pace of change, more uncertainty and a need for more responsive and flexible management. As we need cost reductions, speed increases, flexibility, &#8230; downsizing, delayering, divesting is common. We need to become more efficient. We need to partner and form alliances. And management in all of this is more about perception and facilitation than analysis and control. Creative managmeent is about changing the way organizations are run, opening up their climate and management style, increasing participation and freedom. Enable the organization to innovate and network. Creative management is linked here to transforming organizations while managing innovation is about new product development.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Creative Leaders&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A creative leader has a vision, is charismatic enough to inspire others to follow that vision. A creative manager&#8217;s role is to attend social needs, ensure open atmosphere and see that ideas can be brought to fruition. Kanter (1991) argued that creative leaders formulate the idea and have the power to advance it. They are good communicators and build coalitions, work through teams and are persistent. They can communicate their vision, inspire and carry their dreams into reality. They have very good social skills. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This is linked to Goleman&#8217;s (1998) idea of emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-regulation and  motivation to manage yourself and empathy and social skill to management relationships. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are different leaders though, who could be the Visionary, Entrepreneurial or Transformational leader. Ricardo Semler (1994) goes even further with the self-organizing company. Further information on the different leadership styles can be seen on page 26 of the book. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creative Managers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Creative endavor is only likely with committed staff. Empowerment and network is key and Morgan (1991) highlights the following properties for today&#8217;s managers:
- Reading the environment
- Proactivity
- Visionary Leadership
- Human Resource Management
- Remote Management Skills
- Using IT to transform
- Managing complexity
- Contextual Competencies&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;We are moving into an environment where the manager has far less control and has more of a facilitative role. In general, I agree here to the extent that a good manager will make your job easier and this is not about control but it is very hard to let go as a manager. You protect teams from unnecessary obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You need to have the ability to look at situations from different perspectives, taking an overview. Senge (1991) wrote about the importance of mental models and Kanter (1991) used the analogy of a kaleidoscope. Understand the logic and concerns behind different stakeholders&#8217; position is very important.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To be facilitating you need to also allow for sufficient autonomy while still giving stretch and challenge. Kanter (1997) believed you need to offer learning opportunities. Proactivity is about being prepared, potentially using scenarios to play different situations out beforehand. Networking is key because ideas emerge in social settings and employee loyalty is often more to an industry than the firm. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creative Teams&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Successful teams include people from different styles and backgrounds. There will be a mix of characters. Innovators often competors in their teams for example. Belbin (1988) included the following roles in a team: leaders (task oriented shaper and people oriented chair person), ideas person (creator or plant), resource investigator, monitor-evaluator, team worker, implementer and completer. He later added the specialist.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You often need multi-disciplinary teams with a project leader and (comment: a great sounding job!) the technological gatekeeper who keeps his technical knowledge upt to date through informal networking, as well as a product champion or business sponsor who steers the product through the orgnanization.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The climate needs to be one of freedom, trust, commitment and diversity. Freedom and control of your own work along with good project management and some system of encouragement and feedback are good. Trust is only likely possible in groups of 50 people or less. Pearson (1989) argued for a clear strategy and Kanter (1997) for common values. Stacy (1996) emphasised the capacity to accept ambiguity and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organizational Change&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Lots of things are tried here, including continuous improvement, benchmarking, quality, learning, development, knowledge-sharing initiatives, &#8230; . Re-engineering is another idea while Semler&#8217;s book Maverick, about his own company Semco offeres another radical idea. Remember that most organizational change fails.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In the end, the manager needs to care for employee development, foster collaboration and commitment.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Change and globalization are leading to creativity growing in importance. Technological innovation has led to an increasing pace of change. Handy (1991) suggests that things are developing so fast that you can only expect the unexpected. That&#8217;s the only certainty you have. Due to globalization and the internet, barriers of entry to markets are being lowered and there is ever-increasing competition and pace of change. You need to be creative enough to add value through continual innovation. While previously value was being added through labour, land or capital, this is now happening through creativity, knowledge, innovation and learning.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Nature and Origins of Creativity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Creativity generally has two characteristics: newness and appropriateness, where newness means that some idea seems novel to the perceiver. Before the 1990s, most researchers believed that creativity was an ability, linked to mental flexibility and relevant experience. It was also being linked to intrinsic motivation but only later did the effect of work climate and environment be recognized to play an important role. The social context is important.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Individual Characteristics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Creative people do the unexpected, are original, have a dream or purpose and are very determined. Lesser characteristics are flexibility and a positive outlook. One of their abilities seems to be that of finding problems, finding the important question and they can tolerate ambiguity. The importance of a special trait has decreased considerably over the years. Style however is gaining importance, especially focussing on incremental improvements, an adaptive style of creativity. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;When creativity is seen as a mental skill, one about mental flexibility, being able to withhold judgement and shift perspectives. This can be taught though, meaning that this skill is transferable, even though it is only part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This already shows though, that to have a creative organization, you need to allow thinking out of the box, foster a positive outlook no matter what, tolerate uncertainty and stress the importance of questioning everything. Add open (really open, not want to be open) communications and you can get there.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Experience, Knowledge and Motivation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ll start with a quote here, as it fits just a little bit:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Hire and promote first on the basis of integrity; second, motivation; third, capacity; fourth, understanding; fifth, knowledge; and last and least, experience. Without integrity, motivation is dangerous; without motivation, capacity is impotent; without capacity, understanding is limited; without understanding, knowledge is meaningless; without knowledge, experience is blind. Experience is easy to provide and quickly put to good use by people with all the other qualities.&lt;/I&gt; - Dee Hock&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Now let&#8217;s see what the course has to say. Creative people seem to have relevant experience but they still value chance. The experience services as an easy access point to different scenarios. In this sense, expert recognition is very important, meaning older and more experience staff will have more creativity, provided that the climate lets them. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Amabile (1983) suggested that neither mental flexibility nor relevant experience are sufficient, but thye need to be combined with intrinsic motivation. The problem with intrinsic motivation really is that it is very individual, different for everyone. People will be most creative in areas that they are most interested in.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Context of Creativity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Work climate and culture are important, as people will do more exploring when they feel safe. Then you need to trust that it will emerge, because it cannot be fored. You need to give freedom and tolerate mistakes and allow people more time to communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Freedom is the greatest when the ground rules are clear. Chalk out the playing field and say, Within those lines, make any decision you need.&lt;/i&gt; - Dick Brown, chairman CEO of EDS&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The soecial context is gaining importance with Csikszentmihalyi (1996,1999) looking at the aspects of the creative individual, domain of knowledge and the social field. He found that there are some fields that lead to more innovation, bringing in the point that what has gone before is important, and you need to allow people to connect.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Emergent creativity borrows from complexity theory in which very complex systems seem to be capable of self-regulation. Creativity is likely to occur at the edge of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changing Conceptions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Creativity research looked at the who, how and getting around barriers. Innovation research looked at how ideas reach the market and knowledge management  recognizes the importance of local knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Following is a very good table from the books summarizing everything up till now a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Cause&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Strategy&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Implications&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;80&quot;&gt;Ability&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;80&quot;&gt;Trait&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;170&quot;&gt;Identify creative abilities&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Not everyone is creative&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Style&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Balance styles in teams&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;All people are creative&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Field&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Nurture creative networks&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;All people are creative but will not be recognised as such unless their idea is accepted by their field&#8217;s judges and opinion makers&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The ideas of creativity have changed from a chosen few to everybody, redical to incremental, unique to new to you and ideas to implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;How do you develop your creativity? Model yourself against traits of creative people. Think positive and look for opportunities at all times. Be playful and take risks. Do things with passion and persistence.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In the end, personality, mental flexibility, experience, motivation, organization climate and social context all play a small part in the quest for creativity.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So what would Google look like if they used the same layout as Yahoo! does for their frontpage. Anil Dash took the Yahoo! front page and greyed out the areas of services that Google doesn&#8217;t have. Thanks Anil.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Remember disruptive innovation? There is a very nice article at FastCompany about this at the moment, giving a good overview of the problem.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;&quot;It was as if everybody clapped their hands and suddenly the managers who had been so revered were vilified,&quot; recalls Christensen, with a sad shake of his head. &quot;The dumb-manager theory of business problems just didn&#8217;t hold water for me. There had to be a deeper reason why smart people would make decisions that lead to failure. I wanted to know why. Why is it so hard to sustain success? Why do good companies fail?&quot;&lt;/I&gt; - &lt;a title=&quot;Fast Company | The Industrialized Revolution&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/76/revolution.html&quot;&gt;Fast Company | The Industrialized Revolution&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>They also point to <a href="http://www.innosight.com/">Innosight</a>, founded by Clayton Christensen to be a disruptive consultancy in the world of McKinseys. They are argueing that they can make you a growth business far cheaper than these guys can. That might be a company to watch, especially with theorists often not being the best practitioners.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Currently the discussion is going on how to make money with blogs and I do believe the discussion is flawed. First of all, we have to remove from the discussion group blogs or subject focussed blogs that have been launched partly to make money. They have a standard problem like any media company has and they are just using a blogging tool as their content management system. This is not what this should be about&#8230;</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>What I am talking about is the standard blogs, by people, by groups, as a labor of love, of dedication. These that don&#8217;t want to be a media company, those that don&#8217;t want to go managing their cash flow. For those, there is a lot broader of a picture.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ensight.org/">Jeremy C. Wright</a> has somehow become a source of authority about Google and is moving closer to his dream of working at Microsoft, via blogging. <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joi Ito</a>, venture capitalist, has been thinking to focus more on blogging, both in business and in his personal life. <a href="http://bornholz.typepad.com/blog/">Ingmar Bornholz</a> is taking the idea as far as to think about an open company via his blog and he just started. <a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/">Loic le Meur</a> started a bit over a year agoa and just set up the <a href="http://wef.typepad.com/">World Economic Forum Blog</a>. <a href="http://www.design-management.de/">Ralf Beuker</a> is blogging his teacher life and set up a group blog for his Design Management course. <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/">Jeremy Zawodny</a> is using his blog to find new employees for Yahoo! and educated the world by blogging his housing hunt and buying.</p>

<p>This list could go on and on, but these people have a few things in common. they are not making money vie their blog as such but thy are creating wealth. Wealth for society at learge and for themselves. Far beyond monetary wealth.</p>

<p>This is what this is about. This is why this is a lot deeper than simply making money with blogs. Loic le Meur wouldn&#8217;t have to build up another company but first of all I think he can&#8217;t not do it and second, which is the important point, is building somethingthat can change society for the btter.</p>

<p>We are moving to power back to the people with this. The media amazing power and will continue to have that but this is like enabling a counter weight. The question here would be how the individual would value having her voice heard? The internet is not about control, but about the free flow of information, enabling a lot of view points to be out there and public and for open discussion to take place. It will be and is uncontrollable and shouldn&#8217;t be. Yes, some radical views will be out there too but there will be a discussion about them.</p>

<p>How do you value sometimes possibly getting financial and personal reward for getting sombody a job? How do you value building up your name through sudden interviews with the press? How do you value getting your dream job? How do you value getting eedback from fellow MBA students at a meeting tell you they love your blog showing print outs which they read on the way to the meeting? How do you value helping somebody with a problem they have?</p>

<p>Most importantly, in a world where the power is moving back to the employee, the employee willing to take more risk and take charge of their own life, moving arround easily and readily and not being bound down by one corporation? My knowledge isn&#8217;t in here but the depth of it can be guessed and seen and I will be more likely to be approached for a job that I would care about than anything else.</p>

<p>This is where the value of blogging comes from and this cannot be measured with money alone. Money will only allow you to do this without cost and this can be done with a free blogging service too. If you want more power of expression, you might have to pay for more powerful software, but then you have a view of yourself that is a lot clearer and you will be willing to pay for that. The meetings I had with people through this blog are already worth a lot more than the money I pay for my <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a> account. And this is only the beginning.</p>

<p>Welcome to your power.</p>
