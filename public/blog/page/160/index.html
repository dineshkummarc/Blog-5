  <div class="entry-content"><p>Are you looking for a way to optimize your landing pages? <a href="http://www.optimost.com/">Optimost</a> seems to have a solution that might work for some of you. You just provide the content elements and Optimost will build the different pages for you telling you which work best. This generally sounds like an interesting message, when you don&#8217;t care for your CI or anything else. I would say this only works for companies doing it for themselves. If you do it for others, it is likely to be a hard sell at least.</p>

The APIs of Google, eBay and Amazon. They are starting to take off and find some use. Ranging from price analysis for used Golf equipment in the case of a golf shop to access to your Amazon wishlist from your mobile phone (finally you can check your wishlist when in a store, something Amazon doesn&#8217;t really want ;)).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that <a href="http://google.blogspace.com/newgooglelook">Google is testing a new look</a> (only some see it), at least for the results page. Seems to be largle an interface design move from my point of view. They are moving away from tabs, making it even more clearer, pushing the results up a bit the option to search for images and other thing down. Good idea. Interestingly enough, Google AdWords seem to be even more seperated now. It will be interesting to see how this goes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ross Mayfield is blogging from the <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2003/12/red_herring_con.html">Red Herring Fall Converence</a> about a presentation from Lawrence Calcano, co-head of technology group of Goldman Sachs. (&lt;a title=&quot;Ross Mayfield&#8217;s Weblog: Red Herring: Lawrence Calcano&quot; href=&quot;http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2003/12/red_herring_law.html&quot;&gt;Red Herring: Lawrence Calcano&lt;/a&gt;)</p>

<p>Here is an interesting part:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;New research rules. The research settlement mandates the seperation of banking and research (can&#8217;t even send an email between them). Research decides what to cover and can&#8217;t co-participate in pitches. Research will be less critical for entreprenuers in selecting banks than previously.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>This is actually wonderful. I didn&#8217;t know it went that far. The thing is that previously, you could almost buy a good research paper on your company when your public offering was handled by the bank the researcher worked at. This is why the good researchers came to the pitch. This was about to stop but I kind of missed the changes in the laws governing it.</p>

<p>I presume the e-mail part is just something the lawyers cooked up to not be in trouble later as every conversation would be in writing and archived for always ;)</p>

<p>If you want to read more about what got presented at the event, you can read tons of stuff on Ross&#8217; blog starting <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2003/12/red_herring_con.html">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After reading <a href="http://www.u-blog.net/loic/note/57130">Le Meur&#8217;s post about it</a> I just joined <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> and started trying to get some collegues and friends to join. In general, this is part of the entire social software type of applications that are starting to come up online, with <a href="http://www.friendster.com/">Friendster</a> having started it all.</p>

<p>The interesting twist with LinkedIn, next to the cool name ;), is that it gives the entire thing a business spin, allowing business people to link to each other building their professional network. While this is a small twist it moves the entire system beyond the fun idea and into a very usable system for building your connections well into the future. I am looking forward to seeing my network grow. Join in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So where is technology going? It&#8217;s often going where nobody thinks it is but FastCompany has put together a list of five people working on five different things that could really have some very high potential.</p>

<ul>
<li>Jerry Hallmark is working on portable fuel cells that could give your mobile phone talk times of 24 hours instead of 5 hours and not produce any meaningful waste.</li>
<li>Alan Broad is working on smart dust, meaing sensors about the size of an ice cube costing $100. These are then networked and report on vibration, tilt, acceleration, temperature and other factors.</li>
<li>Cynthia Kenyon is working on longevity, haveing worked on the genes of little worms to make them live six times longer. The thing is, that the genes of these wormsa are known but what about our genes? When they are known, it might be more complex but still&#8230; wow.</li>
<li>Chad Dyner is working on interactive floating displays. Think Tom Cruise in Minority Report</li>
<li>Bill Bass is working on online customization, meaning that you give for example your weight, hight, shoe size, sport-coat size and &#8230; voila, off comes your perfect jeans.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On FastCompany, Seth Godin <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/77/sgodin.html">writes about scarcity</a> or rather, scarcity shortage. While I believe the scarcity with music or entertainment lies with the entertainment as such and not with the distribution, I do agree that a company that finds something that is scarce and enables it to be brought to customes at a good price has a very nice future ahead of them, if they can survive competition that is ;)</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;So what&#8217;s scarce now? Respect. Honesty. Good judgment. Long-term relationships that lead to trust. None of these things guarantee loyalty in the face of cut-rate competition, though. So to that list I&#8217;ll add this: an insanely low-cost structure based on outsourcing everything except your company&#8217;s insight into what your customers really want to buy. If the work is boring, let someone else do it, faster and cheaper than you ever could. If your products are boring, kill them before your competition does.</p>

<p>Ultimately, what&#8217;s scarce is that kind of courage&#8211;which is exactly what you can bring to the market.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Very good comment to end with.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As much as I don&#8217;t like to say it, <a href="http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/4390.html">Nokia&#8217;s market share seems to be shrinking</a>, at least in Europe. The high competition is showing and as diverse as Nokia&#8217;s product lineup is, it&#8217;s not really diverse enough. Their platform strategy is great for their margin, but bad for diversity. They need a clamshell model bad (which is coming thank god) and they need to go back where they came from. Innovating, but innovating first. It&#8217;s not really how innovative you are on paper in this respect but how innovative you are in the eye of the buyer.</p>

<p>Of course, Siemens is currently pushing hard into the low end of the market, and this obviously hurt Nokia. At the same time, they might not have had a big dent in their sales as such, as the higher priced phones might be from Nokia still.</p>

<p>And they are still pushing new titles for the N-Gage out, even <a href="http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/4389.html">one new one by themselves</a>.</p>

<p>As for the increase in sales, I <a href="http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000587.php">talked about the sales increase</a> mid june 2002 already, on Motley Fool. It is going slowly but the changes that are apparent to users are coming off age and are moving into the mass market. Things like polyphonic ring tones, color screens and picture phones / mms, are showing users at first sight that it&#8217;s worth getting a new phone. And the replacement cycle hasn&#8217;t really started yet.</p>
