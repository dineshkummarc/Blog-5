  <div class="entry-content"><p>You want power? You get power. I posted some time ago about <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/11/18/googles-shipping-container/">Google&#8217;s Shipping Container Data Center</a>, an idea to put an entire data center into a shipping container. That seems to have been done, as of today. Check out Sun&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sun.com/emrkt/blackbox/index.jsp">Project Blackbox</a>. It&#8217;s a shipping container that you can, sometime maybe, buy from Sun, including 250 Fire T1000 Servers.</p>

<p>You configure it, get it shipped and dropped of somewhere, then just add power and internet and you are done. Sadly, it&#8217;s a prototype. So it might just be a marketing stunt by some photoshop artists inside Sun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;This is actually just about the two players that I recently had talks with but none the less it is interesting to see the moves these two are doing.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;First up is <a href="http://openbc.com">OpenBC</a>, or rather Xing, which invited some bloggers to communicate their new brand. The meeting took place the monday after the news of Xing broke. I actually have to confirm that they clearly didn&#8217;t want that to happen. First up I got a call from Daniela the day the news broke saying that this wasn&#8217;t planned and they actually had a very busy weekend because of it. Inviting bloggers to communicate the new brand the first time actually wouldn&#8217;t have made sense if the leak was intentional. It seems that one thing they overlooked is that one organisation where they registered the brand allowed for searching for company name to find the registration and not for the registered name only.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Some nice other things appeared in the talk. First up, the name really came from Bill Lao&#8217;s mother and it will allow them, as I said previously, to be a lot more international. Reflecting their international focus, they are now 50 people from 17 nations and have very active users. Their Mission is to cross barriers for a sustainable world, which will be interesting to see how they transfer this to the brand. Their focus will remain on business people though. The thing with the new brand is that they will more easily also connect to professors and the like who do not see themselves as business, though they are in the OpenBC sense. You could actually also say professionals, which was actually their word.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;We then got a presentation of the new design and I have to say that I like it. Navigation will get simpler, and it will be more focussed. They are also going all CSS but are still using tables for emm&#8230; tables, something we (mostly) stopped doing at Ormigo early on. The the talk followed on some future things which will turn out to be interesting. Microformats like hcard, hresume and hevent or even hlisting are one, an upcoming API is another. I am actually really looking forward to the API as it looks very promising, coming somewhere H1 2007. This also means that there might be somebody that gives me a Sync client for OpenBC, which would be wonderful. For things like the API they are actually recruiting developers internally. I am already looking forward to the new platform and what will develop from them becoming more open.
The other invitation I got was to see the new <a href="http://neu.de">Neu.de</a> from <a href="http://nu2m.de">NU2M</a>. This is actually a dating community but only at the time. It ran or runs .NET and is 100% rewritten after NU2M now owns all of Neu.de, which they bought recently (they only had a share previously). They have some very good Web 2.0ish features in the Platform and I am happy to hear that they are putting an end to release cycles, moving along with continuous releases starting first with the basic platform. They believe in the Me Brand and that I will stop wanting to be anonymous on the internet and you need a place to get a human face. As such, they will become a platform to allow me to do that. That also means that they will as a second step move towards social networking as a second step after or as a first before the dating. Currently people having found their date are actually done but the new idea will try to keep them on the platform to socialize in a secured community.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;One big part of what they do is leveraging what they already have with <a href="http://mabber.com/">Mabber</a>. Neu.de integrates messaging via the Mabber functionality in that I can message any use that is online now and talk to them via an integrated web based IM tool, a very cool feature. The main problem I see is moving people from Dating in red, to Social Networking in green. The other way around might be easy, but it&#8217;s a good idea that needs to be tried. We Germans want to remain in control of our data and that&#8217;s why MySpace isn&#8217;t our first platform really.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The will also, with the social networking, add more community features that will be free in terms of autocompleted tags for community search. In that sense I can be part of any community that I can word very easily. On top of that they are adding an authentication method in that they will be sure that I am who I say I am, or reasonably sure at least. This is good as it they can have faksters but without the abusive faksters.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A cool bit is that they are currently offering people a 1 EUR service to send them their pictures to scan them in. This shows that you need to cater to the users you have, and they know that, and lots of their users just don&#8217;t have digital photos of themselves yet. They can also do lots of integration with other stuff they have like mp3.de or location based services through their experience with mobile mabber.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;They also bought in calendar data which they will allow people to comment on and easily meet up at concerts and the like. That shows that they are seeing all those things, like upcoming, as a feature, they right mindset in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Both face different challenges, OpenBC transfering the brand all in all, and Neu.de to see if they can convert people to social networking without destroying their business model. They both have big goals and at the moment they are not going into the same space but we will see how this one plays out. OpenBC has the mind share, Neu.de the marketing power. But more about that marketing bit later.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://secondlife.com">Second Life</a> has gone offline. I just read about it <a href="http://www.blogh.de/643">on Blog Age</a> and it sure sounds interesting and shows how interesting virtual worlds can be. To put the problem back in our world, somebody found a bug that allows other people to steal (or rather get control over other persons items) and they are now working on fixing that. :)</p>

<p>The official Second Life Blog has <a href="http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/10/14/grid-closed-while-exploit-is-addressed/">some more infos</a> for those wanting to see the story develop from inside. There are already well over 1000 comments from the close to 1 million players. I hope they have a good backend when 1 million people start downloading the new client. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With YouTube getting bought up by Google, which I won&#8217;t even link to as you all read about it already, the video space is really hotting up and I do expect that the German space will hot up too, as JÃ¼rgen Habichler notes <a href="http://habichler.wordpress.com/2006/10/10/google-buys-youtube-for-stunning-165bn/">here</a>.</p>

<p>When looking at the different platforms out there, I will actually have to say that I think <a href="http://sevenload.de">Sevenload</a> will soon get a good amount of money. Their interface is great, they are <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;amp;range=1y&amp;amp;size=medium&amp;amp;compare_sites=&amp;amp;y=p&amp;amp;url=http://sevenload.de#top">growing well</a> (remember alexa is just an indicator) and the site is still responsive. If they have their system internationalized already, then some of the big VCs might be really interested. The other thing is though that if there was a candidate for an IPO it was YouTube and what will the next guy do. There wasn&#8217;t huge competition around the buyout from Google it seems, meaning that there aren&#8217;t too many buyers out there that want to spend oodles of cash. And once you have a VC in, it&#8217;s pretty likely that you will either have to see or IPO, that&#8217;s just the way the business goes.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see how this one turns out.</p>

<time datetime="2006-10-06T08:46:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 6<span>th</span>, 2006</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;I recently found two interesting articles relating to Google&#8217;s management style. It starts with Steve Yegge talking about <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/good-agile-bad-agile_27.html">Good Agile, Bad Agile</a>. Working along the agile development approach with some changes, this obviously interested me. In a sense he is right. On it&#8217;s own, without adaptation, without thinking, it is another fad that consultants will exploit. It is also true to many other things I have learnt about people management, so the general ideas underpinning agile software development are right.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;After having worked at Google for some time he thinks he has understood the development process and I will take his word for it as the insights he give ring true.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;They are not really using managers as such but mostly tech leads as they code themselves. In the end, I believe developers choose their tech leads themselves as different people have different skills and the &quot;lead&quot; part should be taken up by those with the most developed necessary skills of the moment. Management&#8217;s task is to facilitate that and get out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Another point is that you as a developer can switch projects and teams at any time. This of course requires a big company, as you need some amount of projects, and you need some system to make sure every project is filled. But more to that later. That you can spend 20% of your time on other projects is known and a good idea if you have the right people that will work on related projects any way as that inspires them.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;They also have very few meetings, which again comes with clearly defined projects. &quot;Make the search results appear faster&quot; doesn&#8217;t require a lot of meetings other than with your collegues over a brainstorm.
The interesting thing is that there are no Gantt charts of date-task-owner spreadsheets. Nothing resembling project management as such. We are moving a similar way though. The thing is a Gantt chart doesn&#8217;t make you faster. Identification with the vision does.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You also don&#8217;t work insane hours (&quot;unless you want to&quot; with the &quot;want to&quot; being pushed a bit ;)) which again relates well to Joel&#8217;s point that 8 hours of creative work are all you get out of people. With 12 hours they are bound to do other stuff and you start getting higher turnover. If you do it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;One important part that I didn&#8217;t know up till now is that a large part of Google relies on incentives. Your reward is in relation to how important management sees a project. The incentives are financial and in other forms. The &quot;other&quot; part comes from Google&#8217;s peer review culture, which I posted about recently. If you have good people and a peer review system, with financial rewards tied to peer reviews to a large extent, then the review of those peers, people you respect because you know they are good, will have a large incentive component. Check this:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I might have been mistaken, actually. Having your name and picture up on that big screen at End of Quarter may not be the biggest incentive. The thing that drives the right behavior at Google, more than anything else, more than all the other things combined, is &lt;em&gt;gratitude&lt;/em&gt;. You can&#8217;t help but want to do your absolute best for Google; you feel like you owe it to them for taking such incredibly good care of you.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;All this does though is to get people to work on the right projects. The best explanation is his first sentence on this:
&lt;em&gt;&quot;At Google, projects launch because it&#8217;s the least-energy state for the system.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Ok, there are project managers, and product managers and all that. But they really only nudge. Teams sit together, lots of meeting rooms are there. Meetings happen in the middle of the day, and people come in early or late to keep the rest of the day to working.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;But again the small pionts matter. Google takes &lt;em&gt;&quot;things like unit testing, design documents and code reviews more seriously than any other company&quot;.&lt;/em&gt; That results in them having one code base, and switching teams and sharing code becomes easy.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The other thing is that Google is not date driven. Their drive is their desire to build something. Google wants things done as fast as possible. You need to create that urge.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Something I agree with is that index cards are not the optimal solution. We are actually using FogBugz here and it provides us with a good work cue, per project, per release. If you add time estimates it gets even more powerful but they tend to be a pain in a smaller organization. Don&#8217;t mistake this for trying to control people. It is just to have an idea of how much work is in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I also agree with him in that you can&#8217;t do too many sprints or too short sprints. You still need a bit of freedom. We are currently using two week sprints, but something have a break of a week in between or just cleaning sprints. What the sprints do help with is having a bit more structure above and beyond projects. Of course you can work on the next sprint tasks if you want, but everybody knows that there is a clear goal with the current sprint and that goal is something we all want to reach because we know why it is there. The date at the end is just to give us a clearer goal.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then there is the part I fully agree with. You can do things, that are not really part of the sprint, but that will improve your productivity immensely in the remaining ones. I could make a sprint saying that this one does not have unit tests in it, or that the idea to move our javascript interaction to it&#8217;s own framework will cost us time &#8230; but that is short sighted, and this short bit might be super short.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then <a href="http://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/09/management-and-incentives-at-google.html">Greg Linden talks a bit</a> about all this incentive stuff. Gives it just this other bit of certainty.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
