  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has happened again, my &quot;To Blog&quot; bookmark folder has reached a size that is too big, so I need to clear some of it out, at least the smaller bits.</p>

<p><a href="http://twittearth.com/">twittearth</a> is a wonderful tool to leave running on your desktop and it seems an OS X screensaver is coming. By then I hope to hear about it again, because it would be a cool screensaver to use.</p>

<p>Want to have the photo application that will appear on MobileMe from Apple for yourself? Check out <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com/demos/">SproutCore</a>, which is what it was based on it seems. I have to admit I still like Flickr, and the second part <a href="http://www.funambol.com/">Funambol</a>, could be the syncing part and push email service. I did try it shortly and I am not sold, as I am not fully sold on MobileMe. I like GMail because it is different and with IMAP I am close to push email. Contacts are synced with the Mac and then Phone and always with me, and calendar items are synced with Google Calender, &#8230; I am not sure what else I need.</p>

<p>Tried out <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid</a> already? Really nice. Create a browser for Gmail and one for Twitter, &#8230; and so on. When one crashes the rest stay up. :) you can also create a menu extra out of the browser. So if you create one for m.twitter.com and make it a menu extra you have your own little twitter app. Very cool.</p>

<p>There is a very good discussion on the future of social media right <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2008/06/11/a-conversation-about-social-network-interop-and-activity-stream-relevance/">here</a>. I do fully believe in the openness part, and it is actually the only way all the social part will really work, or at least the business models, but that means that execution counts and that is something that the big guys are really scared about. They also want a bit part of the pie and not a small part of a bigger pie, which is stupid and not how the internet works. But who am I to tell them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/etsy_ebay_distributed_mass_customization.php">Is Etsy the next eBay</a>? Really old, and no, I don&#8217;t think so, but it is interesting to think about and there are some valid points. Congrats of course to <a href="http://dawanda.de">DaWanda</a> in germany for having picked the space and gone through hard times to get there.</p>

<p>The really important part in the above article though is this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We may be witnessing the historical high water mark of giant companies in developed economies. In 1955, Fortune 500 companies generated 1/3 of GDP in America. In 2000 that had risen to 2/3. If you prefer %, from 33% to 66%. Hidden in those numbers are the countless family farms that could not withstand the onslaught of Agribusiness and the Mom &amp; Pop shops that closed when Wall Mart came to town.</p>

<p>Imagine a world where the Fortune 500 share of GDP went back to 1/3 and small businesses got back the 1/3 they lost in the last 50 years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
THIS is something I truely believe in. The devide will get bigger. The Fortune 500 will get bigger and there will be a lot more smaller ones and the middle will thin out. There is still something called economies of scale but they changed a bit. This article on <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/relocalization_opportunities_l.php">Re-Localization</a> is another one that rocks. This is exactly the space we are attacking with Ormigo in that stuff if becoming more local, services are becoming more important, the the local/service/self-employed/SMBs need a system to really use online efficiently. We are learning a great deal through our customers and users each and every day, which makes this market very rewarding, as complex as it is.</p>

Just check out <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/immediate-translation-and-mibbit">this bit for a bookmarklet</a>. :) Check out the new <a href="http://www.google.com/translate_t">Google Translate</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Scoble <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/14/why-kytetv-will-kill-qik-and-flixwagon-in-cell-phone-video-space/">posts about Kyte.tv on Techcrunch</a> and how <a href="http://kyte.tv">Kyte.tv</a> will kill Qik and others in the live video streaming arena. I have been testing the new Kyte.tv S60 app on my Nokia N95 for some time, and it is very powerful.Â  I am not yet sure if I want all those features within on applications but it does lend itself to not only quickly sending a video onto kyte.tv but rather as a full channel management application, something Robert needs for his work. I am watching Kyte closely, as one of the video start-ups to watch.</p>

<p>Their winning items are the good channel systems with a feedback loop (they had video responses way before seesmic was here if I remember correctly) and their mobile focus, because that is where this video stuff is going. Yes, it is taking longer than anticipated, but you will mostly post video from your phone, simply because there are now already more phone cameras than digital cameras out there and there are way less video cameras than digital cameras and all mobile phone cameras are moving to be able to record video.</p>

<p>The only thing we need are mobile phone internet flatrates and I hope that the carriers are seeing in the iPhone that a flatrate helps. I don&#8217;t believe the increased usage comes form the iPhone only, but for a large part from not having to think about being online or not. When you have to think in terms of MB used or something, you do start to think and you use stuff less.</p>

<p>Anyway, I do believe Kyte.tv will rule them all and will be one of the big video players to watch in the next 10 years. They have the backing, they have the right focus, and they are developing the right tools. They are just a service that provides a service. They are not focussing on becoming a destination, because the destination is always the player, and the TV of the future is distributed and re-aggregated. There will not be one controlling system.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As sad as it is, Yahoo! has given up and Google is now running ads within Yahoo!. Check Michael&#8217;s post here entitled <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/13/massive-destruction-of-shareholder-value-employee-morale-and-internet-health/">Massive Destruction of Shareholder Value</a> for some good thoughts and links. The thing is that this is actually bad for almost everyone. For example, Google is monetizing better than others because they have more inventory, and more advertisers and more inventory advertisers invent. advert. i.a. &#8230;. As Steve Balmer said, the Flywheel is just bigger. So the advertisers are paying more to buy ads within Google. So now for a search result within Yahoo! for the term &quot;Insurance&quot; you can either buy it cheap on Yahoo! or expensive on Google and in the end, it will be the same click, with Yahoo! probably opting to choosing the expensive one.</p>

<p>Of course, Yahoo! will make more money in the short term, but in the long term that money will move to Google, and their Flywheel will get a size that is just too big to replace. We are almost there, but I still believe there are options to build something truely open that leverages the power of the internet. With the deal being non-exclusive, and Yahoo! being able to mix and match as they choose, the deal is a bit more open but the internet can go bigger than that. There is a nice thing that Eric Schmidt <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/12/yahoo-runs-into-googles-arms/">said</a>:</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;If there were an issue, itâs perfectly possible that you can do commercial deals that look like outsourcing deals which are not exclusive and where industry structures allow everybody to win. If you look in the automobile industry and lots and lots of industries like that, you have suppliers who supply other people. So if there were a deal, it would be based on those sorts of principles.&lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>The thing is that the example just does not hold under analysis. I know somebody working in the part-supplier industry, and yes, by now some car manufacturers are actually buying from different providers just so there will still be 3 different ones at least. That alone would be like Yahoo! buying from Google and X and Y to make sure competition remains high. They don&#8217;t, but help create a monopoly, something that automobile industry would make sure to not have happen. But there is another difference. This is more like Mercedes outsourcing the sales of their cars to a 3rd party. Above that, these cars cannot be stored, but fall of a cliff and die if not sold when created, and with each car your sell (not produce) you gain a bit of knowledge how to sell better. Your short term goal is to let the best seller sell your cars, but your long term goal would be to become the best seller of your cars. Otherwise, sooner or later in that model you become the parts provider where the seller knows your exact cost structure and will make sure you produce content the cheapest possible. Because if you can&#8217;t sell your cars yourselves, you depend on Google to do it for you &#8230; or ads in this respect.</p>

<p>Of course we can presume that giving it all to Google will result in highest prices and best system for all, but that&#8217;s just not have this economic model of ours works. Believe me, I do believe in Google&#8217;s performance marketing model and actually believe even CPM ads should be performance based, but that&#8217;s another subject. The problem is this moves us more into a monopoly and somebody needs to start thinking strategy please, and long term, because short term strategy will default to Google at this point, or to someobdy else that will ultimately be there to market your site for you.</p>

<p>Google actually has <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/06/our-agreement-to-provide-ad-technology.html">something to say</a> about all of this. Of course this is a not a merger, which is a good thing, but if it results in Google becoming the sole provider of search advertising, then emm&#8230; who cares. Google says this does not remove a player from the field, but this is untrue if the investors and management in Yahoo! are thinking short term, because then they do not have an incentive to keep improving and innovating in search advertising (and content advertising which is really what Google is moving to next, all performance based). Yes, Yahoo! can do similar arrangements with others, but who would those others be? If Yahoo! is not doing all of this to make more money, then I am lost, and there is nobody else that would allow Yahoo! to make more money, because there is nobody yet who has applied performance based advertising to an entire property, even though Yahoo! is close to that. But as said, there are no others. And yes, this does not let Google raise prices for advertisers, &#8230; but as detailed above, again, who cares.</p>

<p>So this is a lot more dangerous then some make it out to be. We need a real strategy, we need some bold steps, we need a Linux of Advertising actually.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Location based services, or LPS, is something that all people rave about with the iPhone. A good article comes from Mashable under the title &quot;<a href="http://mashable.com/2008/06/11/iphone-gps/">And, The Really Big Think About The New iPhone Is</a>&quot;. In it they say that I will finally bring to us the wonders of location based services, citing Loopt as one example. There is one comment though that puts it into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;blockquote&gt;I conducted a large user research project for Vodafone in the UK and Italy [&#8230;] The near universal reaction was negative. This was primarily due to privacy concerns [&#8230;]&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This is not to be argued away really. It is one of the reasons I have a problem with stuff like Plazes. I just don&#8217;t want people to necessarily know where I am now. &quot;In London at a Meeting&quot; will tell everyone &quot;Go rob Oliver.&quot; because you know what, my address is easy enough to come by. Even showing it to your friends gives it the risk to getting out. e.g. Polar Rose, which I really like and see lots of potential in, has a Firefox extension that allows you to tag people in images. The problem was that you could do that in Flickr, in pictures ment for you, and Polar Rose would then grab the exact image, which is not under privacy control as only the HTML/PHP files are, not the JPEGs themselves. This is just one example of where it could go wrong. They either already fixed it or are on their way to fix it by seeing if they can see the page that the image was found on for example.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This is just one example though why the privcay concerns are valid. Above that, you will never have one system where everybody is in. I will not find all my friends via it, and with my real life friends probably very few. For the geeks among them a twitter message is enough to get a meeting ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So there it goes on the record. I don&#8217;t believe in automated LBS that publish my whereabouts. I do believe 100% in e.g. doing a search and factoring in locality, or similar things. I am doing something for the local/services market anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That is really the question. I presume &lt;a title=&quot;T-Mobile&quot; rel=&quot;homepage&quot; href=&quot;http://www.t-mobile.net/&quot;&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; in Germany will launch their prices soon. I would presume the 8GB version going for 49, 99, 149, 199 EURs and the 16GB for 149, 199, 249, 299 EURs dependent on contract, which is actually already the case for the 8GB version. And don&#8217;t come with me with the idea that his Steveness said that they will all go for $199, $299 max, because the 8GB would be cheaper, and the 16GB too, just being more expensive with other contract. I am actually wondering if &lt;a title=&quot;Apple Inc.&quot; rel=&quot;homepage&quot; href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; did not let T-Mobile in Germany try out the rebate system to see what would happen, and at 99 EURs the 8GB version probably sold very well. (Update: might be wrong. see <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2008/06/10/o2-confirms-free-iphone-deal-and-more/">here</a> for UK prices which start with free. My 2nd Assumption, subtract 100 EURs from all my above prices.)</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the subject why we love the iPhone. I love Michael&#8217;s post &quot;<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/10/i-am-a-member-of-the-cult-of-iphone/">I am a Member of the Cult of iPhone</a>&quot; where he said some very valid things. I actually presume the Apple brand managers want to kiss his feet. First quote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Apple is about elegance, design, and potential, and we love them for it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Especially the potential is an important term here. But on to and another one:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I love the iPhone for the same reason I love technology in general, and loved Disneyland as a child - it drives my imagination and makes me wonder what kind of magic to expect next. Also, it just works.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This instantly made &lt;a title=&quot;Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy of needs&quot; rel=&quot;wikipedia&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.thylmann.net/2003/04/03/understanding-motivation/&quot;&gt;Maslow&#8217;s Hierarchy of Needs&lt;/a&gt; pop into my head, a theory about how people are motivated. It splits down our needs in different levels, and I&#8217;ll try to look at them from the perspective of a phone. Remember that the first level has to be fulfilled for the second to have any effect.
&lt;ol&gt;</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;li&amp;gt; Physical Needs: (e.g. working conditions, housing, wage, ...) The phone has to work. There choosing a good carrier helped because you have superior voice quality here at T-Mobile for example.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Safety: (security in job, health insurance, ...) We want it to work in a year still and don't want to think that we made the wrong choice. Apple made sure they are seen as in the forefront of technology. And remember this is all touchy feely, because it might lack a video camera mode but most people don't use that yet.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Social: (sports, parties, open communications, ...) They made the device into something to talk about. It's so flashy that you want to carry it around and show it to your friends.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Esteem: (Regular positive feedback, prestigious job titles, ...) I feel good about myself, because there is nothing better out there, and it just freaking works, and fast at that.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Self-actualisation: (challenging, encouraging, can structure own work) This is actually what is coming with the next version, iPhone 2.0. It allows you to tailor your phone.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
</code></pre>

<p>&lt;/ol&gt;
Now the thing is that &lt;a title=&quot;Nokia&quot; rel=&quot;homepage&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nokia.com/&quot;&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt; understood that self-actualisation bit from the getgo, and physical needs and security where covered at all time. The problem is that the world changed and now security includes &quot;can I watch videos on it&quot; or &quot;can I surf the web with it&quot; and the iPhone just feels more like it can do that. On top of that Apple is the clear Master at the Social and Esteem part of it all. Nokia is now crumbling because they are missing the middle. I am still holding on to my shares tightly because they move huge volumes and will continue to do so, but for the digerati, a fully well shaped motivational pyramid is important and I want mine to be nicely shaped too.</p>

<p>update 2: See <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/iphone_20_big_in_bubbleland.php">here</a> for some verey good comments. The features as such are not revolutionary. Yes, the Nokia N95 that I have in my pocket can do more than the iPhone can. The problem is that many aren&#8217;t there as a need but as something to brag about and that is not something that you can do with the N95.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The rumors are going wild, and I can understand. The latest is coming from <a href="http://cultofmac.com/hot-tip-iphone-2-features-detailed-3g-gps-2xram-thinner-better-battery-and-only-200/2032">Cult of Mac </a>and I&#8217;d like to add a few points.</p>

<p>The iPhone sells here in Germany for 99 EURs. Yes. 99 EURs. It&#8217;s the small version and only with the big contract (89 EURs a month, 2 years fixed) but that&#8217;s the price. The new phone will surely have 3G, which means UMTS and as it is a new phone it will have HSDPA, which is like improved UMTS. There are already rumors of speeds of 40 mbits/s and this is actually nothing tooo special either. It&#8217;s called HSDP+ and the standard just gets to that speed. Of course there are not many if any phone out yet with that chip, but more importantly, there is no single network I know of that supports those speeds yet. I seriously doubt that AT&amp;T will have a full HSDP+ upgrade, but we will see what happens there.</p>

<p>GPS is probably just something you put in there because you can, batteries always get better so that should have better performance too. With memory becoming cheaper that will increase too. Ok, understood.</p>

<p>Now to the price. I doubt the price will change but a large problem is that in the US you can just buy the iPhone and then still &quot;need&quot; a contract with AT&amp;T. Giving a big subsidy here is something that will most likely get AT&amp;T a lot bigger of a share of the full iPhones out there because not so many will be jail-braked. Here in Germany we already have subsidies and it might be that they are pushing those higher, meaning that also the big iPhone will get some subsidies. Currently only the small one has them, probably because it doesn&#8217;t sell so well. With the new one coming out, and contracts being around 90 EURs a month, I see no problem with T-Mobile giving a 300-500 EUR extra. Might be that the 200 pounds/eurs/dollars is for a small version though. The networks know the value of an iPhone user now, so they will do their best to get them.</p>

<p>So all the rumors seem likely I have to say. I just wish they fully open it up and let you use the phone in any network.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>no it won&#8217;t. Simply as that. Scoble thinks Friendfeed will win, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/25/twitter-2/">Arrington believes in Twitter</a>, so <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/24/blame-friendfeed/">does Steve Gillmor</a>. Now Loic comes in an says <a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2008/05/friendfeed-is-g.html">Friendfeed will kill Google Reader</a>. Enough already people!</p>

<p>I do like Twitter, I do like Friendfeed and I do like Google Reader. And I don&#8217;t think anyone will kill anyone here. Twitter is a communication system with a very clear focus. The noise level is way higher for Friendfeed and in terms of Google Reader, that&#8217;s me desciding what to read in terms of sites. These things ar three totally different things and they will hopefully move their seperate ways.</p>

<p>I did start playing with the Friendfeed API though to see what interesting things can be done with it, so I do agree that there is a lot of power behind Friendfeed. But I have been using a similar system with Noserub for some time and I have my install at id.thylmann.net which actually allows me to stay master over my own data, which is something that is totally missed out here. The data Friendfeed aggregates is scary indeed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;The question will be gaining importance over the coming months (for the digerati) and years (for normal people ;)). With the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2008/05/10/the-other-shoe-in-social-networking-drops/">other shoe having dropped</a>, and now <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/15/he-said-she-said-in-google-v-facebook/">Facebook banning Google Access for Friend Connect</a>, things are hotting up. The short version, Facebook says that they do not allow Google access because people will loose control over their personal data when they do that. This has been proven to be untrue, with the simple fact being that there is no Facebook API through which Google can tell Facebook to add a new option to people can change their sharing preferences for Friend Connect connected sites within Facebook. People can do that on the site they shared their info on or within Friend Connect, but not on Facebook, which is a Facebook problem though. Scoble <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/05/15/facebook-has-a-point-where-it-comes-to-your-privacy/">adds a few more things</a> which are relevant though, coming back to the age old problem of syncing your data across several services, something that needs to be settled once and for all and probably never will. The problem is that Facebook descided for me that it is a problem for me, which I might not agree with. (Update: Later somebody from Google comments that even that is wrong. )&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The problem comes down to the fact that Facebook does not want to loose control. Share your friends with Google Friend Connect and Google knows your friend and you can theoretically leave Facebook and take your friends with you. It&#8217;s not quiet there and but that&#8217;s what this might end up in. Michael has a great post about Data Portability on Techcrunch entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/16/data-portability-its-the-new-walled-garden/">Data Portability: It&#8217;s The New Walled Garden</a>&quot; and he is very right. Let me quote one bit from Michael&#8217;s article:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;blockquote&gt;Let me put this another way. &lt;strong&gt;How dare Facebook tell ME that I cannot give Google access to this data!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I am starting to wonder if there really isn&#8217;t a huge opportunity here, but still in the wondering phase.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There is one thing I would like to add though. I personally entrust my social network to <a href="http://xing.com">Xing</a> for example, and I will most likely entrust it to Google and there is one simple reason for it. Motivation on the side of the service I am entrusting it to.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Xing has a clear revenue model. I pay them a monthly fee to get a few extra services and with that model they get a wonderful EBIT margin. They are doing fine and I sure hope that Lars keeps his head on straight and doesn&#8217;t do anything irrational that removes the clarity from that mission, but I am pretty sure he will do the right thing. Xing&#8217;s motivation is in getting my data, getting my connections, having my friends on there, and getting me to sign up for more services. Great. Making it more freely available is something that Xing will have to deal with because when I can access it from anywhere, I will be happy to put everyone on there, also my non-member contacts while I am at it, making it my address book, but <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2008/03/18/what-i-want-xing-to-be/">I wrote about that before</a>. Huge opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;For Google, they are an advertising company and they want information. But beyond that, they really do want all information to be freely available because that means that they will be able to run ads again that information, find it, give people better answers, &#8230; you know what I mean. that means that my social network is just a means to an end, not the end in itself for them, as the monetization sits somewhere else. That&#8217;s the beauty of Friend Connect. They help more social networks blossom and more content being created and content will win. Freeing up my data is in their best interest, or rather making it available.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;For Facebook, there is no business model. I am not sure if making the data available to me is something that they will do because the only thing they have is that data. They have no business relationship with me, or do not have some other use for that data other than mining it and at some time coming up with an idea.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So who would you entrust your data with? Nobody (aka something like Noserub) or Google, or Xing, or &#8230; .&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Things are really hotting up now in the social networking space and it goes in the right direction due to peer pressure. For the news I am talking about you can <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/09/threes-company-google-to-launch-friend-connect-on-monday/">read this Techcrunch piece</a>, but in short:
&lt;ul&gt;</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;MySpace launched Data Availability (see [Mashable](http://mashable.com/2008/05/08/breaking-myspace-announces-data-availability-with-yahoo-ebay-and-others/))&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Facebook answered with [Facebook Connect](http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;amp;story=108)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Google is coming with something they call &amp;quot;Friend Connect&amp;quot; on Monday as of Techcrunch&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
</code></pre>

<p>&lt;/ul&gt;
While this is not real <a href="http://www.dataportability.org/">Data Portability</a> it is a good first step that has actually been a lot more likely. The race is now going full throttle in terms of who will be your identity provider on the internet, meaning everywhere in the long run.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that you can use your MySpace/Facebook/Google information and give access to it on other sites. So I might register somewhere else and give it access to granular bits of my identity, giving the new service information about my friends, hobbies, most clicked ads, brand affinity, &#8230; you name it. This will go a lot further than simply moving your friends around. Especially because this is only Data Availability (with all 3) not portability, so you are not moving anything around.</p>

<p>The problem is that there will be one main provider most likely. If I attach all my new services to my Google account, Google will know about all those services and Facebook will only know about itself. Hence being at the center is important. Portability is not needed to convince the average Joe, but Availability helps making your the center.</p>

<p>That also means that building a social network gets easier as such, you just need to bring a unique value, bring something to the table that is not in the data but rather in the service you provide with that data. It is really nice seeing it all come together because it validates the choices we made at <a href="https://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a> in terms of development and furthers my belief in the long-term vision.</p>

<p>We have Hotmail, AOL Mail and Yahoo! Mail as players in the email space in the US (GMail is really still tiny among normal people ;)). So who will be the winners in Social Networking or Identity Data Provisioning. Facebook, or is it just a fun place to hang out at? The mail providers as they already know? LinkedIn, but they don&#8217;t have the mainstream. Plaxo might be interesting. Somehow I feel Google has the data to do it efficiently. In Germany we have United Internet with Web.de/GMX/&#8230; in email, so there might be another winner here, but will it be StudiVZ or Xing? Xing is still too small, StudiVZ not trustworthy enough (yet?). The race is still on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As Ibo <a href="http://www.ibrahimevsan.de/2008/04/29/secret-garden-prinzip-in-der-entwicklung/">just posted about Sevenload&#8217;s Secret Garden strategy</a>, I thought I&#8217;d wage in with my own thoughts on structuring your development environment. We see ourselves as a technology company at Ormigo, mainly because we do not believe the local market problem, getting it online, will be solved with a sales force.</p>

<p>Ibo&#8217;s article is in german so I will try to translate a few of his views and comment and elaborate. He is only giving a few insights, but they are relevant none the less. The basic idea is to build an environment that helps to build great products.</p>

<p>What Ibo has developed, with Tom and Axel, is to put the developers in a &quot;hermetically sealed&quot; environment, meaning they are behind closed doors. The general idea is good in that you need to get into a flow and disrupting developers in their work is bad. Fully closing the door and letting nobody in is an interesting concept and I am looking forward to hearing more of how it works. From my personal experience I would argue that you then need core teams and an operations team and that operations team needs to be in another room, because there are operating things that need to be discussed shortly.</p>

<p>The other big problem with this closed door is that you loose communication, and the most important thing in software development is communication. That is the entire idea behind scrum, which he hints on later. Of course the communication needs to be structured, but based on his idea, there would be no problem having teams dispersed over different countries, especially because he says that most communication goes over an internal IM client.</p>

<p>He does say that developers need the right gear and among others two monitors. We have been doing that from the start and it is proving very valuable, but it is not limited to developers. Especially if you say that developers need a laptop, buying a second 20+&quot; monitor is needed and the price point is not so much different from a desktop system in many cases. One thing I like is his idea of having large flatscreens on the wall that give the status of the servers and features in development or just launched.</p>

<p>There are no walls between people in the same group, which I agree too, but only glass walls between different teams within development. We actually have smaller rooms here, with 2-3 people in development in one room because some people need to close the door from time to time. That is really his secret garden idea but tailored to the developers that want it like that and those that don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>His basic ideas of a secret garden actually fit to scrum again and also are often common sense, like not fighting but discussing. But that is a culture thing and the culture at Ormigo can sometimes seem rough. This is an extension of having people with experience and clear views in the company though, and we can all disagree vehemently, discuss things and then come to the conclusion for a plan to follow, because each view has been heard and we can then agree to disagree but agree on a plan. That is very important, and needs a good managed of a meeting culture, which is independent of the secret garden system though in my mind.</p>

<p>He also says that they have only structured discussion among small teams, also with different departments, which is fully reasonable. It fits with our meeting system for bi-weekly deploys. In the middle of the current sprint we have a short meeting with everybody for an update of the current sprint and discussing the next sprints high level goals. There we also discuss who is responsible, which will be one person from bizdev and one developer as a minimum. That allows for rotating responsibilities through the entire team. This small team then makes sure to get a better idea about what the next sprint will be about showing that in a short meeting over lunch at the end of the week. Next monday we normally deploy our current sprint, and then go down into tasks for the following sprint, splitting up different tasks for different people in kind of sub-responsibilities. Then the system starts over. So yes, you need small meetings, clear responsibilities, but you need very semipermeable walls between each department in the company, while being clear that you don&#8217;t just walk up to somebody and ask a short question (which is hard sometimes).</p>

<p>Congratulations for using JIRA as a task management system, even though I am not sure if it does not create too much task management overhead. Doing development for corporations that might be needed though. We are using Trac internally and are feeling very happy with it because it allows us to easily handle small sprints and mix around tasks. Yes, there are no task dependencies in the system and no required process flow, but that is not needed with the right structure behind it and small sprints. These interdependencies are only needed if you do a 3 month sprint for example, where you start to need a real project management. Interdependencies are for us between sprints on a higher level.</p>

<p>He also says that often you loose yourself in technical details, which is something I can only agree with. This is why the development team needs to know the business side and the numbers and the real goals. Goals are not &quot;build feature x&quot; but &quot;get more SEM traffic&quot; or &quot;allow more ratings&quot; which can be measured afterwards. The technical detail bit is actually what makes the difference between a great developer and a good one. A great developer will know what is needed and what is overkill. You should not die in beauty. But there again the bi-weekly deploy system works very well in that it requires you to focus.</p>

<p>Looking forward to hearing more from Ibo about their structure and how it is working out. Scrum is great but real Scrum is REALLY hard.</p>
