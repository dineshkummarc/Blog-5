  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having returned from my holiday, I am going over some blogs and Scot Hacker&#8217;s &lt;a title=&quot;birdhouse.org&quot; href=&quot;http://www.birdhouse.org/blog/&quot;&gt;birdhouse.org&lt;/a&gt; has an interesting post entitled <a href="http://birdhouse.org/blog/archives/000804.php">lucky</a>. Two interesting links from there. For one, <a href="http://www.robert-fisk.com/iraqwarvictims_mar2003.htm">these pictures</a> are of civilian casualties in Irak. No, we didn&#8217;t see those on TV. The second one is an <a href="http://www.megnut.com/images/iraq_war_flow.jpg">Iraq War Justification flowchart</a> by megnut. Still trying to keep an open mind here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Matrix was a great movie and The Matrix Reloaded is just arround the corner. If you can get your hands on the latest WIRED then I highly suggest getting it because it includes a great article about the making of The Martix. The second one now includes a fully computer animated fight scene in which they put the faces of Neo and Agent Smith back on the computer animated figures because this is the part of the human body that people notice to be fake the fastests. With the help of this technology, they can now fly the camera arround the scene at will, finding the best angles.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was the title in WIRED about what Nick Denton is currently doing. What he is doing is coming up with ideas for blogs, having them designed and then paying an editor to handle the site. It&#8217;s an interesting concept, even though I do not know if it will ever be profitable. Actually, I doubt it, but it largely depends on the return of the advertising industry in termf of revenue. You can read more about the current sites <a href="http://www.nickdenton.org/archives/001731.html">here on his blog</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Based on the other books by Neil Stephenson, especially Cryptonomicon, I was looking forward to this one. It&#8217;s writting together with Frederick George and I couldn&#8217;t put it down until I was finished, reading it the entire trip back in the plane from the US, which made the trip back seem a lot shorter than it was.</p>

<p>To keep this short, the book is very good. Without giving anything away, it&#8217;s about somebody wanting to be president of the united states, a lot of money, interaction of chips and brains, understanding human emotions, demographics and great characters. As always, the characters are layed out in great detail, which allows the reader to feel part of the story to some extent.</p>

<p>If you like Neil&#8217;s other books, you will like this one, even though it might be called a bit simpler than his previous ones. I actually like that though because I feel that Snow Crash was a bit too complicated. Sure, it was an amazing book, but I felt that Neil Stephenson was trying to prove his writing skills with that book, moving to just writing a great book in Cryptonomicon. With Interface he has simply written a great book, with the help of Frederick George, or vice versa, whoever was taking the lead in the writing of the book.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The sub title of this book by the ex SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt ist: &lt;i&gt;What Wall Street and Corporate America Don&#8217;t Want You to Know - What You Can Do to Fight Back&lt;/i&gt; and this exactly what he is telling you in this book. Here is a Chapter overview to help you decide if this is a book for you:</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>How to sleep as well as your broker</p>

<p>&quot;&lt;I&gt;Brokers may seem like clever financial experts, but they are first and foremost salespeople.&lt;/I&gt;&quot; This is something that <a href="http://www.fool.com/">TMF</a> and others have started to tell the world about a long time ago, but it is simply true. They are paid based on the commissions they generate, which can take many forms, including something called spreads, the difference between what the firm paid for something and what you will end up paying.</p>

<p>The seven deadly sins of mutual funds</p>

<p>Here he talks about fees, taxes, indexed and managed funds, culture of performance, preaching long-term to the customer and having short-term investments in the fund and misleading names.</p>

<p>Analyse this</p>

<p>How analysts analyse companies and what consulting contracts and other things their employee has with the target companies have to do with it.</p>

<p>REG FD: Stopping the flow of inside information</p>

<p>Before REG FD it was common practice to wisper numbers to analysts before actual numbers appeared. In general, CEOs tried to be nice to analysts for good recommondations and similar things. Well, since REG FD this is getting a lot harder.</p>

<p>The numbers game</p>

<p>Here Levitt goes on about accounting standards. &#8216;nuff said. The next chapter, beware false profits: how to read financial statements, is going on in the same direction.</p>

<p>Pay attention to the plumbing</p>

<p>This goes a bit deeper into the system how your order is being handled.</p>

<p>Corporate Governance and the culture of seduction</p>

<p>What do the boards of companies really have to do and what are they really doing? Very insightful indeed. The general question is whether boards are really independant and are working for the investors (which they should) or for the CEO (which they often are).</p>

<p>How to be a player</p>

<p>This tells you a bit more about what you can do as an investor to make this turn out well for yourself. Getting your 401(K) in shape is another chapter about &#8230; well, getting your 401(K) in order.</p>

<p>At the end, the book includes some wonderful letters that Arthur Levitt received over the time he was SEC chairman.</p>

<p>All in all, I found this book really insightful and interesting to read at the same time. The part about the 401(K) is abviously of less interest to me because I am German but it should be very interesting to everybody living and working in the US who is using such a plan for his retirement. The rest of the book should be extremely interesting though for everyone who is investing money in the stock market in any way or form.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally found an application for the iBook that lets me scan the airwaves for 802.11b aka Wifi networks whereever I am. The nice thing is that it works without any big changes in the system and is a graphical OS X application. Simply wonderful. <a href="http://www.macstumbler.com/">Check it out</a>! And while I am at it, <a href="http://www.etherpeg.com">EtherPEG</a> is a tool that lets you monitor your ethernet port for GIFs and JPEGs. You can recompile it for connecting to the AirPort port and then when you are in a nice network with lots of people this might be a fun thing to watch :)</p>
