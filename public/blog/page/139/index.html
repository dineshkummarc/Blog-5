  <div class="entry-content"><p>This seems to be studies week. I just put my summaries of <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/2004/03/project_apprais.html">Project Appraisal</a> and <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/2004/03/company_apprais.html">Company Appraisal</a> online on the <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a> in the last two days and to finish this off I just registered for a new course at the <a href="http://oubs.open.ac.uk/">OUBS</a>. This one is entitled &lt;i&gt;Creativity, Innovation and Change&lt;/i&gt; and will likely be both relaxing in relation to the current Finance course and a huge amount of fun. From what I hear it includes lots of different things to make up perfect teams, brainstorming, handling change, lots of interesting little tidbits. With the residential school on this one you are more or less asked to not stick with your group but to wonder arround, leave at any time, change groups, look at something else, &#8230; wonder freely in a sense. Free your mind. I just hope that I will not free my mind up too much with this ;) We will see.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;(comment: As originally posted on the OUBS Blog)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways of doing this and I for one do believe that only a very small part of this has anything to do with financials. Then again, financials are important and it&#8217;s good to have a well grounded foundation. So there we go. What can one do?&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value to Assets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Publilius Syrus pointed out &#8216;A thing is worth whatever the buyer will pay for it.&#8217; and this in itself does depend on a lot of different factors. So what are a company&#8217;s assets worth? You need to determine the book value and then move from there as you might want to put a slightly different valuation on assets than how they are presented on the balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Book value will tell you how much the company is worth to the ordinary shareholders, meaning the value of the assets minus that of the liabilities to third parties. Some call it book value of equity, others shareholders&#8217; funds or net asset value. You can also look at that per share and if there are options that might be exercised, then this will increase the number of shares and hence the &lt;em&gt;fully diluted book value per share&lt;/em&gt; will be lower.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In the end, the book value and assets held will be valued somewhere between the historic cost of assets and the current market value. You might need to adjust that.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Tangible assets are normally depreciated according to some estimates or revalued in case of land that does not wear out for example. In case market value goes below depreciated book value, these assets will be revalued to reflect market value in the books, even though this will never be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In some countries (e.g. USA, France, Germany), property is always inclueded at historic cost, leading to a book value potentially way below current value. In the UK, the move to include these assets at current value was done because sometimes companies were taken over and their assets sold at a profit. Now the true value of the assets is made clear to the market and not only to those people looking very very carefully. Return on assets shrinks then though and this means that some companies prefer to lease.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;While most of the time interest on debt is an expense, some countries allow it to be capitalised for construction projects.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Intangible assets like R&amp;D expenses and brand values are sometimes a very high value inside a company but are hard to value. The capitalisation of brands like Coca-Cola might give a clearer picture to the market value of the company. In the UK, you can capitalise brands if you bought them but not if you build them, bringing in the role of goodwill. This goodwill would be the difference of the price paid for a company and its book value and this difference can appear on the buying company&#8217;s balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;With goodwill it is important if and how it needs to be written off. If this needs to be done against the income statement then the earnings per share will be reduced, making it less attractive to pay high goodwill at acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;[This again shows that it is of major importance to look at the cash flow statement!!!]&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Off-balance sheet items can be leases, pension assets or liabilities which can be mentioned in the notes only. Leasing can be seen as just another form of conventional debt. This lead to finance leases now needing to be included in the balance sheet if more than 90% of the value of the asset is paid during the lease period. Companies do need to disclose year by year changes in pension fund values. In Germany you need to remember that companies do quasi capitalise pension fund money on the balance sheet, meaning that when comparing them to non-Germany companies you need to find out which amounts of money really do belong to shareholders. Enron is a good case where off-balance sheet transactions hid too many things.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Calculate like this:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
Book value of assets
+ Adjustment for replacement cost on inventory, plant and equipment
+ Overfunding of pension fund
+ Undervaluation of intangibles
= Adjusted book vlaue of assets
- Current liabilities
- Long-term liabilities
- Contingent legal liabilities
= Adjusted book value of equity
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Multiples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This is another method of valueing a company and it is almost dead simple and makes comparison easy. You start with the market multiples of public companies, with large companies giving you a good idea and small companies a less good one. The problem is that the bid and ask spread in smaller companies is bigger as the market maker has a more difficult task to sell or buy back the trade after completion. [Boy are market makers fun things ;)]&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are some more comments to make though. Stock exchanges tell us that any price can also not be a &#8216;fair market price&#8217;, with a fair one implying at least the semi-strong form of efficient markets. In emerging markets, the quality of information available is also hard. Also, the market price implies that you can sell or buy the shares at this price, which also depends on the volume you are talking about. You will have a big problem buying 30% of Microsofts outstanding shares without the price going up ;) Last but not least, a share price is always quoted at &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; specific time, which can be different at any other.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Further factors influence a stock price:
- Shareholder loyalty
- Additional benefits
- Employee loyalty
- Premium for control
- Fashion&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Specific multiples include &#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&#8230; Dividend yield ignored capital gains or loss. It is now seen that not paying dividends increases capital gains and vice versa, and dividends should only be paid if they can be better employed elsewhere by the shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&#8230; Price to book implies that investores are willing to pay x times the book value because of the growth potential. This is rather meaningless on its own but insightful when compared to other companies or over time or to an index.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&#8230; Tobin&#8217;s Q is an interesting one being about whether to set up a company from scratch or buying one. It is calculated via (Market Captitalisation) / (Replacement cost of assets net of liabilities). If it is below 1, you better buy the company, and if it is over 1 you should do it yourself. Other people argue that with the increase of intangible assets, Tobin&#8217;s Q can be above 1 on average, also for an entire market. [One might argue that with a lot of hope in the market you go above 1, when hope wains, you go low&#8230; really low.]&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&#8230; The PE multiple is a calculated by (Share price) / Earnings per share = (Market capitalisation) / (Earnings for shareholders). The higher this ratio the more bullish the shareholders have to be about the company. A higher PE ratio is often attached to companies with a high quality of earnings, meaning a very steady flow of earnings and earnings growth. When comparing across countries take into account diffferences in their account standards, as well as different economic cycles. Also take into account atypical drops or rises in earnings as well as potential provisions.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&#8230; Price to cash flow should be calculated by on (Share price) / (Cash flow per share) where:
&lt;em&gt;Cash flow = Operating cash flow + Other Income + Interest received - Interest payable - Taxation&lt;/em&gt;
Cash flow can be very volatile in relation to earnings though, as there is no depreciation for example.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&#8230; Enterprise value (EV) to EBITDA looks at the entire enterprise and kind of at a cash flow before capital expenditure. EV is normally defined as market value of both debt and equity and preference shares or convertibles minus minority interests. You need to decide whether to include short term debt, meaning as to whether to consider it funding or a temporary thing. EV/EBITDA tends to be more stable than price to cash flow. The higher the number the higher the exptected margin and the expected growth. It is also attractive because it is independent on the capital structure and depreciation policies.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discounted cash flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Shares traded on the stock market should reflect the value of the company, meaning that discounting the future cash flows to the share price should lead to a zero net present value. [Sounds good doesn&#8217;t it? ;)]&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You can either do it at an equity level, meaning dividends, or the enterprise level. You need to take into account cash flows before financing but after taxes discounting them typically by the WACC. You then subtract the value of debt and minority interests from that value. The OUBS gives you a spread sheet to try to work through all of this and they suggest several steps:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the time horizon for your forecast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at economic and business cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider positive and negative growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conside the time of above-average returns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forecast operating cash flows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine value drivers (e.g. change in sales, NOP/sales, sales/NPPE, &#8230;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimate historc, current and future ratios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decide on cash/investment policy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determine residual value&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decide on value methodology (eg. EV/EBIDTA ratio in the future, or growth in perpetuity)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimate the WACC including the determination of debt/equity ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discount the cash flows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine enterprise value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine equity value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conduct sensitivity analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potentially prepare related financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valuation in context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes valuation is very critical. A closer look is taken at them here&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&#8230; Regulation will have an effect with some companies as to how to value the company, for example in cases of previously state-owned companies that have now gone public and still have a quasi monopoly that needs to be regulated.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&#8230; New issues (flotation or primary issues are when a company goes public the first time) can be done in several ways. For example a price might be fixed before the new issue based on the value of the company as a going concern or a little below that. A new method mostly used in the US is called book building and is about managing the indications of interest by investors to get the highest price. Fees in the US can be as high as 5% of gross proceeds. It is also argued that return for investors on new issues will be not so high in the long term, partly as analysts will be over-optimistic in their forecasts, especially if their company has some hand in the offereing ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&#8230; Privatisations
The valuation here very much depends on the terms of just that privatisation, including the regulatory environment and targets they are set or restrictions imposed. BT in the UK had to limit price rises to the cost of inflation -x%. Anther option than an issue is used in Germany a lot, being a trade sale. This means that the company is auctioned off to a private company which will provide both money and management. Another example would be Deutsche Telekom, issuing 600 million shares in a book building method with two-thirds earmarked for German investors.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&#8230; Mergers and Acquisitions mostly really have been partial of full take-overs with real mergers only coming in the late 1990s. The idea was in global markets you need to have a given size. A+B is worth more than A and B on its own. The valuation is even more important in an acquisition though, because this decides who gets the benefit, kind of. Earlier equity was common in a buy, but now debt is more common because it is generally cheaper and might even be tax deductible. Lots of take-overs fail though, but they are still done, partly because organic growth has reached its limit.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&#8230; Restructuring is about the idea of releasing value back to shareholders. If the underlying assets are believed to be worth more than the market valuation of the company, then a leveraged buyout (LBO) backed by financiers can take-over the company and split it up. Another form is the management buyout (MBO) or management buy-in (MBI) or the hybrid transaction of new and old management being called BIMBO.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The success of a company depends, at least to a big part, on how efficiently and effectively it&#8217;s capital resources are used and the CAPEX (captital expenditure) decisions within the company require several functions. This includes marketing, production, services, accounting and finance.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Within your CAPEX decision you need to take account for your strategy and you need to link your expenditure clearly to the resources that are available within the enterprise. This means that you might need to sell projects that do not fit your strategy and/or resources. Maccarone (1995) highlighted strategy in the process by saying that the formal CI (capital investment) system is influenced by organisational personnel and strategic planning. The process itself goes from (and back) identification of potential investment, project definition and screening, analysis and acceptance, implementation to monitoring and post audit.</p>

<p>Techniqques for investment appraisal include &lt;i&gt;capital budgeting&lt;/i&gt;, known as the process of evaluating investments. In addition to a decision on spending money, the resulting expenditure requires decisions on where and in what form to raise funds. In your calculation you need to take into account both the timing of the money flows as well as your COC (cost of capital) and qualitative factors. For the calculation itself, the most commonly used techniques are NPV (net present value), IRR (internal rate of return), payback, ARR (accounting rate of return) and PI (profitability index).</p>

<p>NPV is arguably the best method while IRR seems to be the one preferred as it shows the yield of the invested capital. Payback is used a lot as it is so easy to use.</p>

<p>There are several things to take into account when using these techniques. For one, like needs to be compared to like. This means that in relation to inflation, real cash flows fit real discount rate and nominal to nominal. Just as a reminder, nominal means would be 4% for an increase from $100 to $104 while real would be 1% if you add 3% inflation to the mix, as the $104 would not be worth $104 in relation to the $100 you started with.</p>

<p>You also need to remember that interest on debt-funded investments is often tax deductible. These reductions can then be discounted as any cash flow. In internaltion situations, more things need to be taken into account. There might be a foreign project with a substantial cash flow which could not be carried over into the home country due to exchange controls. These might be circumvented via dividends, royalties or management fees, loan repayments or countertrade (Buckley, 1998).</p>

<p>International taxation includes something called withholding tax, which is a tax levied &lt;i&gt;by a country of source on income paid, usually on dividends remitted to the home country of the firm operating in a foreign country&lt;/i&gt; (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/money/tools/bfglosw.html">source</a>). This is part of the reason that taxation and incentives is a major concern for corporations investing abroad.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Capital rationing&lt;/b&gt; is about, as the term says, dealing with constraints due to several potential projects and insufficient funds to finance them all. You could say though that if there is a positive NPV, it is very likely that a company will be able to raise funds, with a major constraint being the fit with the corporate strategy as well as the ability to manage all projects. To choose which projects to do, PI (profitability index) and cost-benefit index are two methods that can be used.</p>

<p>PI = (Net Present Value) / Investment</p>

<p>If you need to invest less to get the same NPV, then this is the better projects. Take into consideration that resources might be constraint over longer or shorter periods of time and that projects might be mutually exclusive or dependent on each other. You also need to take opportunity costs into account, thinking about a make or buy decision, which can also be evaluated via a NPV calculation, taking into account savings in overhead costs. Also take into account that in fast changing markets, there might be flexibility lost by inhouse projects resulting in unexpected costs. Take into account your strategy. Does the project fit? Also consider that you might loose control over your business by outsourcing though? Is this an integral part of your strategy?</p>

<p>Then there are &lt;b&gt;Risk issues&lt;/b&gt; to consider. Buckley (1998) argued that the DCF method does not allow for enough flexibility in a strategic sense, potentially seeing projects as investments into the future. Managers generally are risk-averse, and the discount rate says that a similar return can be achived through another investment at similar risk, which might not be certain. Many organisations use the WACC (weighted average cost of capital) not taking the opportunity cost of the specific project into account as it is difficult to specify correctly.</p>

<p>Ho and Pike (1991) suggest going though a series of steps in a logical mannger: risk identification, application of methods of reducing the risk, risk evaluation and integration of that into the project appraisal. You can use &lt;i&gt;probalistic risk analysis (PRA)&lt;/i&gt; techniques like sensitivity analysis, probability analysis, decision tree analysis and Monte Carlo analysis. Greater risk should lead to greater required return. Normally the discount rate is raised or the payback period shortened. Some company use CAPM (capital asset pricing model) to determine the required discount rate. You can also take several scenarios and calculate an ENPV (expected NPV) including several results and their probabilities.</p>

<p>There might be a case where there is not a now or never NPV result, and in this case opportunites should be seen as options, the right to do something not the obligation. After having started a project it might be irreversible though. This means that the NPV of the project needs to be higher than the value attached to the option of keeping the investment opportunity available.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Funding capital projects&lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>This is the second big part of all of this. You can only invest what you have. So where would it come from? This could be equity, medium- and long-term debt, leasing, grants or a combination of all of them.</p>

<p>In leasing there are several forms. In general the owner of the assets (lessor) allows the use of the asset to the lessee in return for a payment, but retains the ownership of the asset, sometimes resulting in leasing being cheaper than debt. A finance lease is the same as borrowing funds in that the lessor is assured to get her financial outlay plus return while the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the lessee. An operating lease is over a shorter period, less than the economic life of the asset and the lessor retains the rights and awards from ownership. While the benefits received by the lessor might not cover all costs of the assets, the lessor could sellthe asset at the end of the lease.</p>

<p>Reasons for leasing might be:
- funds not available and no access to alternative sources
- considerable tax advantage, also maybe via owning of the asset by the lessor who might have a better tax shield (think derivative SWAPs here, which come later)
- no wish to own
- off-balance-sheet financing and potentially higher ROCE and AUR</p>

<p>All this could be said to be lease versus buy and borrow. You can calculate the NPV of all in and outflows of cash to see what is the better solution.</p>

<p>&lt;i&gt;Project finance&lt;/i&gt; means that you only take earnings and assets of the project as collateral for loans and finance. International banks do that for toll roads, tunnel projects (e.g. Channel Tunnel), theme parks, power stations, &#8230; . A good example is a new exposition of a running miniature rail road which cost 2 million EURs to build but it now taking in 7 millione EURs a year through 700.000 yearly visitors. It was financial entirely by banks. This is normally more expensive than convential debt but could still be lower than a company&#8217;s overall WACC. Non-resource financing means that financors only have access to cash flows from the project, which is almost unatainable, mostly resulting in limited resource financing. The difference is when a project is abandoned.</p>

<p>In general lenders are attracted because of high fees attached. A lenders analysis will include several types of risks, namely internal (operational, raw material handling, completion/construction) and externally derived (country/political, off-take, market, financial, documentary, force major) risk. A case study in this part of the course is the financing of a liquid gas facility in Oman. Here the risks are too high even for large banks and the risk is reinsured. The principal banks, called arranging banks, underwrite the project and then syndicate to further banks who then sub syndicate for even more banks. The arranging banks take the biggest chunk but distribute the rest.</p>

<p>The banks will take a project base scenario based on reasonable assumptions and build DCFs on a range of financial forecasts. Risk appraisal forms a major part of all of this. The banks might also require contractors to sign off completion guarantees. Country risk is tied to political risk, which is evaluated partly on preceeding deals with the country, and for example a list published in the economist about the risk attached to countries. Perhaps the Word Bank will be involved. Off-take risk is essentially about guaranteeing purchases from the end customers. Market risk is about being able to service interest payments.</p>

<p>The banks (mostly the principal ones) get an arrangement fees, an underwriting fee, a participation fee, a loan spread, commitment fee on the undrawn portion, technical bank fee and administrative roal fee.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Funding public projects&lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>Private equity could also fund public sector projects. This can be in the form of Public Private Partnerships (PPP), which is about exploiting the &lt;i&gt;full range of private sector management, commercial and creative skills. &lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>Public bodies will contract directly with a private organisation, which will accept some of the project&#8217;s risk against the option to make a profit. The operator might be part of a consortium of different companies and banks who haved bidded for the project together.</p>

<p>Characteristics of this include:
- contractor provides capital investment
- funded by consortium members
- some of the construction risk assumed by operator
- operator has an operating license
- ownership of facility goes to private sector</p>

<p>The interest for the public body is:
- less constraints by government controls in relation to expenditure and borrowing
- exploit the added value via specialist</p>

<p>The public body might get access to funding in the short term but need to pay out large shares of future revenues. The PPP costs and benefits are often ring-fenced like in project finance. The process to go into a PPP is often very complicated and the bidding process can take well over a year. PPP schemes have been both hailed and criticised. A critique might be the money burned in case of the german Arbeitsamt in its consulting deal with Accenture for example, with the project being well 165 million EURs over budget.</p>

<p>Next follows a case study on the london transport system, which concludes this unit.</p>

I have to agree though that VoIP will be a huge market and if Skype can get some partnerships with Telcos, then they will be able to let everyone do very cheap phone calls from any VoIP Telefone to anywhere in the World. This will rock, period. It will be interesting to see though what the Telcos will do to protect their long distance calling. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Reports are coming in that blogging is more or less not possible at <a href="http://www.sxsw.com/">SXSW</a>. The thing is that they have forbidden cameras as well as the use of power outlets. Check <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/14/lets_reform_sxsws_no.html">Corey Doctorow&#8217;s post</a> and <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/03/14/sxsw_is_blogger_unfriendly.html">Joi Ito&#8217;s post about it</a>. Of course, Robert Scoble already posted something into Joi&#8217;s comments: <a href="http://sxsw.blogs.com/">The SXSW Group Moblog</a> - Have a cameraphone? Post to sxsw ( at ) blogs.com. And I do believe that what we are seeing here is the recently announced new Moblogging feature of Typepad, including group moblogging. Very nice indeed. Keep it up people, keep it up!</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: The rules have been changed. You are now allowed to plug in and take none-commercial photos.</p>

<p>And now everybody speak with me: Blogs will bring power back to the people.</p>
