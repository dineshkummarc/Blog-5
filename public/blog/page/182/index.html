  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;em&gt;(Originally published on <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)&lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;em /&gt;The book starts with Agenti&#8217;s (1980) corporate planning process. This goes through five stages, from target setting, gap analysis, strategic appraisal, strategy formulation to strategy implementation. There is a good figure on page 6-6 for this one. In essence it says that analysis should preceed choice and choice should preceed implementation.</p>

<p>In reality, Johnson and Scholes (1993) argue that choice, analysis and implementation are overlapping process of the entire process and only in a deliberate strategy do they follow one after the other.</p>

<p>Time is a crucial competitive advantage when moving from part to part of the process, to be able to learn. Value chain analysis can help in speeding up the process.</p>

<p>To speed things up you either need to complete each process faster or do them next to each other at the same time. There is a list of Eccles&#8217; factors for strategic change on page 6-11</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;strategic decisions&lt;/strong&gt;</p>

<p>As of Simon (1977) at the heart of strategic management lies the concept of making decisions to reach corporate objectives. This leads to the decision making process in which you need to first recognize that a decision needs to be made, search for information, evaluate that information, decide and then to a post decision evaluation. There are a number of ways to come to a decisions though.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nesting: breaking it down into smaller decisions</li>
<li>Snowballing: minor decisions develop into a strategy</li>
<li>Recurrence: you take the same decision, or look to take it, several times over</li>
</ul>


<p>Impediments and delays (as of Hickson et al.) come from:
- sequencing: other issues believed to be more important
- co-ordinating: waiting for resources
- timing
- searching: waiting for information
- problem solving
- supplying: waiting for availability of resources
- recycling: reconsidering earlier decisions
- internal resistance
- external resistance</p>

<p>Not all decisions are alike. Constricted decisions involve many sources of expertise but no additional information is looked for.
Sporadic decisions are characterised by delays and impediments and flued decisions involve variable information, negotiation, senior management involvement and need less time.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Patterns of strategic decisions&lt;/strong&gt;</p>

<p>Mintzberg and Water (1985) define strategy as &quot;a pattern in a stream of actions&quot;.</p>

<p>Politics, MacMillan (1978) defines them as processes where actors try to influence to reach their goals, is part of strategy formulation. You should:
- analyse the power and influence of each stakeholder group
- determine allies and opponents
- negotiate with allies
- formulate offensive and defensive strategies for opponents</p>

<p>Power can be used to restructure situations, influence and modify the perceptions of others. Power and influence together determine political ability.</p>

<p>Morgen (1986) identified the following power bases:
- formal authority
- control of scarce resources
- organisational structures and procedures
- control of decision process
- control of knowledge and information
- boundary management
- ability to manage uncertainty
- control of technology
- alliances and information networks
- countervailing power
- symbolism and the management of meaning
- gender power</p>

<p>To find allies and opponents you can use the actor/issue matrix, which puts the issues in relation to the actors. You can also use a relationship matrix to find out who will support whom. Force field analysis is another important point, which shows you forces for and against change.</p>

<p>A tactician will try to find reasons and sourclles of opposition trying to reduce them.</p>

<p>Political strategy formulation goes through the following steps:
- set objectives you can reach against opposition
- select allies
- use political capability as bargaining base
- do not accept an agreement with an allie that achieves less than acting alone
- select a compination of allies
- match your and your allies strenght and weakneses against those of your opponents</p>

<p>When preparing for negoations, MacMillan (1978) suggest to:
- collect relevant facts beforehand
- classify them in relation to issues likely to arrise
- clarify and prioritise objectives
- choose sequence
- choose strategy for negotiation</p>

<p>Three factors must be kept in mind:
- timing
- information
- options available</p>

<p>Strategies are often developed in incremental processes, as it needs to adapt to outside and internal changes. The strategiest needs to be able to look outside even though there will be a lot of negotiation and bargaining inside of the company.</p>

<p>There are three ways that a strategy can develop. Through:
1 leadership, participative or authoritarian, using
- involvement and participation
- education and communication
- support and facilitation
- negotiation
- manipulateing
- co-opt
- coerce</p>

<p>The style needs to fit the circumstance and it has a great influence on the culture of the organisation.</p>

<p>2 culture
Myths and stories communicate a collective experience. Managers develop similar menthal models, which leads to resistance with models not consistent with their own.</p>

<p>3 Enforced choice
This is illustrated in Mintzberg&#8217;s imposed strategy</p>

<p>The strategy development process has been put into an integrated model by Bailey and Johnson (1995), which includes six dimensions of strategy development: Planning, Political, Incrementalism, Command, Cultural, Enforced choice. In each company there are different degrees of the different dimensions.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Thinking&lt;/strong&gt;</p>

<p>Weick and Roberts (1993) argue that strategic thinking is not only about the right mental model and cognitive style, but also about a feeling for actions and mental models of others.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Organisational Learning&lt;/strong&gt;</p>

<p>Organisations that are learning more successfully build a greater pool of capabilities. Walsh and Ungson (1991) found six sources of information that can be learning from:
- culture, with heroes, symbols, &#8230; can be guiding
- transformations can be copied
- structures (specialist knowledge)
- ecology, physical floor layout holds information about status for example
- external archives
- individuals</p>

<p>Watching individuals actions are likely one of the most important points of learning in an organisation.</p>

<p>Management writing is an external source but it needs to be tailored to the own organisation.</p>

<p>Single-loop learning means changing your mental models incrementally. Double-loop learning is about re-evaluating our mental models and radical change. We kind of evaluate our way of evaluating too.</p>

<p>Learning organisations try to promote learning at all levels of the organisation. Schein (1992) believes that the learning culture needs:
- belief that the strategic environment can be influenced
- encouragement to solve problems proactively
- everyone can be questioned
- there is no best way
- look into the future
- open communication
- diversity with communication
- acceptance of complexity</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;This is the actual radio conversation of a US naval ship with Canadian authorities off the coast of Newfoundland in October 1995. Radio conversation released by the chief of naval operations, 10-10-95.</p>

<p>CANADIANS: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the south to avoid a collision.</p>

<p>AMERICANS: Recommend you divert your course 15 degrees to the north to avoid a collision.</p>

<p>CANADIANS: Negative. You will have to divert your course 15 degrees to the south to avoid a collision.</p>

<p>AMERICANS: This is the captain of a US Navy ship. I say again, divert YOUR course.</p>

<p>CANADIANS: No, I say again, you divert YOUR course.</p>

<p>AMERICANS: This is the Aircraft Carrier US LINCOLN, the second largest ship in the United States Atlantic Fleet. We are accompanied with three Destroyers, three Cruisers and numerous support vessels. I DEMAND that you change your course 15 degrees north.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well now this kicks. Our beloved <a href="http://www.joinarnold.com/">Arnie</a> is running for Governor in California and this in itself is interesting indeed. I like the idea that Arnie said that he would pay for his campaign in his own way, with his own fortune of some 40 million USD. Then again, he is already asking for contributions on his web site it seems.</p>

<p>The most interesting fact comes now though. It seems that Arnie has appointed no other than Warren Buffet of <a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Bershire Hathaway</a> as his counsel in economics. Now how cool is that. Arnie is republican and Buffet democrat but it seems that Buffet knows Arnie for some time and believes in his ability to lead California out of troubles. Looking forward to seeing the team that Buffet puts together.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a feeling that <a href="http://www.keepmedia.com/">KeepMedia</a> might just work. What they do is, give you access to a big archive of magazines for $4.95. The important item here is that it&#8217;s an archive. You only get the magazine inside KeepMedia when the next issue of that publication comes to the newsstand. That is something that magazines hardly monetize and hence will gladly agree on for a small fee, if I understand the system correctly at least. I don&#8217;t need to read Fast Company, Forbes, Inc. or Business Week when they come out. A month or a week later feels just fine really, especially if I can read all of them and many more for only $4.95. Interesting concept.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Originally published on <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em /&gt;The purpose of this book is to &quot;explain the wide choice of strategies available and to identify criteria to aid the strategist&#8217;s choice&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formulation and sources of competitive advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;When thinking about strategies keep in mind what the company objectives are (book 2) as well as strategic fit (book 1). To find a feasible strategy, ask three questions:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where are we now? (resources and capabilities)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where do we want to go?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we get there?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Remember that your strategic choices could be limited by different things like legal reasons. To find those limits you can use:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mandate analysis by looking at &lt;em&gt;what must be done&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;what could be done&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;what must be not be done&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stakeholder analyis by looking at what the stakeholder groups think success is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Sources of corporate success as of Kay (1993) comes from&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relationships matching -&gt; distinctive capabilities and strategic assets based on -&gt; a competitive advantage derived from -&gt; corporate success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A way to find success is to find &quot;rent&quot; (value added), which only happens when your company works better than another company in the same industry.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Kay believes that there are three distinctive capabilities:
- architecture (relationships)
- reputation (with suppliers and customers, need to be maintained)
- innovation (compete more efficiently)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Strategic assets can also be a source of competitive advantage:
- natural monopolies
- sunk costs
- exclusivity&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;generic strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Porter has talked about generic strategies being available  to a company:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cost leadership: you set out to be a low cost provider, which gives you additional flexibility in your pricing structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;differentiation: select attributes for your products that are perceived as important to be able to have a price premium. You still need a good cost position&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus: using cost or differentiation you outperform your competition by focusing on a special part of the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;For a cost based strategies you have several drivers of your cost advantage:
- economies of scale
- economies of learning
- process technology
- product design
- process design
- capacity utilisation
- input costs
- residual differences in operating efficiency&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You need to find out what the cost position of your competition is though as only the difference between you and them provides an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Differentiation based strategies is about a balance of unique benefits with the associated additional costs in the case of a broad differentiation and finding a unique segment that is willing to pay extra in terms of focus.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To put the generic strategies in perspective it should be kept in mind that the industry structure is important and the position needs to fit that market and keep in mind new entrants.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Bowman and Asch (1996) added that in our complex world, a lot need to be kept in mind. Customers for example do not care about the input side (costs) and not all differentiators lead to a price premium. You need to pay attention that you are not forcing yourself into one box.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Miller (1986) suggests that you can either use asset intensity (efficiency of asset usage) or asset parsimony (maximum variety out of assets)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Innovation as a source of competitive advantage is important as it can lead to creative destruction (Schumpeter, 1934), meaning large shifts in industry structure.  Banbury and Mitchell (1995) believe that incremental product innovation are crucial to survival of a business. Your innovation might also depend on complementary innovation (MP3 downloads need high bandwidth). Freeman suggests that techno-economic paradigm changes, changes of innovations, organisational and institutional changes, are very important.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;strategic options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;He the book talks about Ansoff&#8217;s product/market matrix (1965) which puts different strategies into a matrix of present and new in both market and product category.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;present/present
- market penetration: get existing market share by competitive advantage or changing basis of competition
- consolidation: firms need to grow in line with market, in mature markets market shares are stable, in declining markts assets change between companies
- liquidation: if resources are better deployed elsewhere&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;present products in new markets
- market development: geographically or in terms of customer needs. often in small or emergent markets; high risk strategy&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;new products in present markets
- product or service development: where existing products do not fully exploit all available opportunities&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;new products in new markets
- diversification: horizontal integration can lead to value greater than the sum of its parts; biggadike (1979) found that this normally needs 8 years to bear fruit&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This matrix provides us with a deeper look at selecting generic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing options and choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Johnson and Scholes (1988) suggest testing for:
- suitability
- feasibility
- acceptability&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Rumelt (1955) suggest:
- consistency
- consonance
- advantage
- feasibility&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There is risk in not looking at the probability of the foreseen outcomes, which does not mean that you need to remove uncertainty. Perceived risk is largely in the eye of the person thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Tapiero suggests looking at all forecasts and then estimating their probabilities&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The real world is about weighting risk and return. These need to be weighted (could be in a matrix after Day 1990)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
