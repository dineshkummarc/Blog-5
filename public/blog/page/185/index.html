  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now this could be fun. Most digital cameras give the pictures you take some special name including a number. The first picture I took with my Ixus was IMG_0001. A sony&#8217;s Mavica first image would be MVC-001. Of course, if you do over X photos the number might come again, but &#8230; it is likely that if that&#8217;s the filename, then that&#8217;s the first foto. Now <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;q=IMG_0002&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search">tage a look</a> what were the first photos of other people with an Ixus (or camera that saves IMG_XXXX as filename.) :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am currently giving <a href="http://www.hitboxcentral.com/">Hitbox Personal</a> from <a href="http://www.websidestory.com/">WebSideStory</a> a try as a statistics tool and for now I am very happy about what we achieved with <a href="http://www.counted.com/">Counted!</a>, especially because we are two people instead of an entire company. I have to admit though that their enterprise, e-commerce version and other services (most of which we had imagined too, but that is easy to say now) look very much nicer. Sadly they call cost money, or good for them rather ;) The 2nd biggest problem I have with the personal free version is for one that it needs the big banners which is annoying but understandable. The biggest problem though is that it just needs too many damn clicks to see anything! Everything is on its own page and that makes it very hard to get any decent kind of overview. I will play with it some more out of interest but it will likely disappear again soon. Just too annoying.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Job&#8217;s did it again. Going just a little bit overboard but creating a great vibe with it.  The Apple Developer Conference started yesterday and the great man himself had his keynote and I am positive he amazed some people. I mean there will be <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/">new Powermacs</a>, which will be 64bit and at 3Ghz in 12 months, using a 1Ghz frontside bus, 6.4 GBps memory throughput &#8230; wonderful stuff. Also, the Jaguar is dead and long live <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/panther/">Panther</a> which brings threading to mail (woohoo) and some other cool things that you can read on the page. One thing to note is that you can now switch users easily and when doing that, the desktop rotates on a 3d cube from the old to the new one. Pretty cool ey? A full transcript of the keynote can be found <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/wwdc2003.html">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally posted on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>Superior performance over time comes from a distinctive and hard to imitate competitive advantage. Opportunities emerge from a firms unique capabilities. Grant (1991, pp. 118-9) argues: &lt;em&gt;While resources are the source of a firm&#8217;s capabilities, capabilities are the main source of its competitive advantage.&lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>This resource based view moves strategy more to the level of the organisation and will help to understand ones organisation and its uniques bundles of capabilities that can or need to be grown and used/exploited. It is still unresolved whether this view complements or substitutes the market-positioning view of Porter. Both likely have more or less importance in different industries, depending on how competitive the environment is for example.</p>

<p>There are two methods to find resources and capabilities of a company. Ones looks at functional areas and the other uses Porter&#8217;s value cahin methodology. Then you cna find the (potential) sources of advantage, sources of improvements, linkages, costs drivers and more.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Why do organisations differ?&lt;/strong&gt;</p>

<p>Different organisations cluster resources and capabilties differently and some then work more efficiently, have better access to scarce resources or a better capability to learn and build new or exisiting capabilities. Especially the last point is important because internal and external environments change. Otherwiese, sets of resources might make prisons out of existing recipies. Now please read Grant&#8217;s article on resources and capabilities.</p>

<p>To be remembered here is that your resources and capabilities need to fit the environment your are working in and organisations differ in their ability to secure an advantage from the resources and capabilities, which is what it is ultimately about. We now live in a world of uncertainty, complexity and conflict and exactly this also brings with it multiple opportunities.</p>

<p>It is also critical that the rare resources that a better performance is based on, need to remain scarce/rare for a long time. You need to try to make sure that the competitor thinks it cannot immitate what you do. The thought is what counts here. Sometimes resources need to be built up a certain way and over a long time, which is something that is hard to imitate. Heterogenity is necessary but not sufficient for a long-term sustainable advantage.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Know-How, tacit knowledge and human resources&lt;/strong&gt;</p>

<p>Here the mini case on Saatchi &amp; Saatchi is a great read. In general, the fact that a lot of knowledge is mostly embodied and internalised inside human beings means that acquireing an investment bank, financial services company or software house carries a high risk because the humans that carry a lot of the knowledge that makes the company work might leave. Accenture tries to internalise as much of the knowledge inside the company in routines and recipies as possible to be able to leverage economies of scope and to reduce the risk of loosing that knowledge. Consider team play in tennis here though. You can&#8217;t just copy a good team or take one member and put her into another team.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Resources and capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;</p>

<p>By the 2nd half of the 20th century, resources have gone global and become more mobile, like technology, information, brands and financial instruments. These days, all that is needed is sufficient access to the resource. This could be developers for a european company sitting far away in India or doctors diagnosing patients hundres of miles away.</p>

<p><a href="http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/grant-framework-r-c.gif">&lt;img width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;grant-framework-r-c.gif&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/grant-framework-r-c-thumb.gif&quot; /&gt;</a>
Framework for analysis of resources and capabilities by Grant (<a href="http://www.ennead.de/ou/archives/000794.php">more here</a>)</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Markets and hierarchies&lt;/strong&gt;</p>

<p>Oliver Williamson (1975) argued that to choose markets (outsourcing an activity to them) or the hierarchy (doing it yourself), you need to look at the total transaction costs of what you are doing. EDS is growing tremendously by taking up facilities management and often take up the staff of the company they sign a contract with under their wings too. This is central to thinking about your own capabilities, those that you need to secure your customers and those that you can more efficiently outsource. But, you need to think about what outsourcing a function might do to your company in the future as it might drain crucial knowledge and expertise.</p>

<p>Economies of scope are also important here, which are derived from using a resource more than once, with little or even no extra costs. You could also call this synergy. You also need to build up routines to learn and transfer capabilities long-term. The resource based view suggests that to find a competitive advantage you need to look at the processes of capability building, capability management and capability retention. These processes as such can be a competitive advantage. Some, who have been in place for a long time might even need to be broken up to enable new processes to form (see the Novotel case here).</p>

<p>Also important is to not outsource things that might build tacit knowledge needed for later innovative capabilities.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Innovation&lt;/strong&gt;</p>

<p>An important capability is that to innovate. This gradually moved from the entrepreneurial skills to bigger R&amp;D labs, especially where critical mass is needed. The problem here is that R&amp;D needs to be closely linked to the factory, market and sales, as to develop products or services that the company can build. At the same time you need to watch out that your R&amp;D lab does not become something that only researches per order but can freely experiment and find truely new products. (I suggest reading The Innovators Dilemma by &#8230;&#8230; here.) Remember that R&amp;D is not only about innovating from within but also about understanding innovations coming from the outside. Everything arround you changes and so does your strategy and so need your capabilities.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;The boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;</p>

<p>You do not need to own all your resources though. Your capabilities should stay internal though. The question then becomes where an organisation should draw the boundaries. These boundaries are often changing based on mergers, divestitures and other things.</p>

<p>Quasi-integration is now more popular because it allows (through contract or agreement) the same control without the need for one single company. An example is cited with Marks and Spencer and its suppliers. They almost form a virtual organisation, being dependant on each others activities. This collaboration among firms common to the virtual firm concept is getting more widely used, partly due to the increasing complexity to have all resources and even capabilities in house.</p>

<p>You also need to build organistaion capability to learn and transfer knowledge. This includes tranfering the long-term routines that hold organisation&#8217;s forman, informal, codified and tacit knowledge.</p>

<p>To understand the boundaries a value chain is essential.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Originally published on <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This is chapter 5 of Robert M. Grant&#8217;s book &lt;em&gt;Contemporary Strategy Analysis&lt;/em&gt;. This time, we move along with a general shift in focus from the industry environment to the resources and capabilities of a company in terms of strategy, something that has been a shift in the 1990s. Please tag along.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s strategy analysis concentrated on the industry environment, something very prominent in Michael Porter&#8217;s work. International diplomacy was more resource-based though, with a balance of power being very important. In the 1990s, the resource-based view became more important in the sense that a firm&#8217;s resources and capabilities determine it&#8217;s strategy. This was especially true in fast changing markets where a market based view didn&#8217;t provide the consistency and longterm focus that a strategy needed. Broadening what a market ment didn&#8217;t help in many cases because it is very hard to server customer requirements across a wider market (e.g. railroads being in the transportation business). Other companies that focused on developing and exploiting their internal capabilities adapted well to external change. The question that comes into play is whether to focus on your external customer needs when your product becomes obsolete or whether to focus on your core capabilities and resources. The question would be if Kodak (who&#8217;s capabilities are/were in chemistry) or Canon (who know technology) would succeed in digital imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are two types of profits. One is associated with the absense of competition (monopoly rents) and the other with a firm&#8217;s superior resources (Ricardian rents, after 19th century economist David Ricardo). The resource based view argues that profitability does not come from doing the same thing but doing things differenty (something I whole heartedly agree with by the way).&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Resources of the Firm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Here you have tangible, intangible and human resources and make up your capabilities and hence the strategy. The strategy is influenced though by the key success factors of an industry and a company will have to seek a competitive advantage, preferably long-term, with its strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;From tangible resources you need to ask what you can do to economize on them or where you could employ them more profitably.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Intangible resources can also be trademarks and brand names (brand equity, calculated by taking the price premium attributable to the brand and putting it in relation to the entire revenue stream). It should be remembered that reputation can be attached to brands or companies. Technology is another intangible asset.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Human resources are the productive services offered to a company by it&#8217;s employees. Here the emphasis is moving toe flexibility, learning potential and collaboration as well as emotional inteligence (see D. Goleman, &lt;em&gt;Emotional Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;, the second book is a bit more management like and practical).&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizational Capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;It should be clear that resources are not productive by themselves. Capabilities refer to putting them to good use and this good use should be in relation to other firms. To find your capabilities you can look at your functions (Corporate, management information, R&amp;D, manufacturing, product design, marketing, sales and distribution, &#8230;) or take Porter&#8217;s value chain methodology.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter have referred to organizational routines in the sense that regular and predictable patterns are normally the basis for a firm&#8217;s capabilties. They are to the firm what the skills are to the individual as Grant puts it.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;They are also hierarchical, meaning that more general capabilities are integrated for specialised ones. This integration only works with the help of knowledge of individuals, which is why cross-functional teams are so en vogue.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Hamel and Prahalad note that it is the firm&#8217;s ability to leverage its resources that make them into capabilities. This can be done by concentrating, accumulating, complementing, conserving or recovering them.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#8230; then comes the profit&#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The profits depend on establishing a sustainable competitive advantage and in appropriating the returns to that competitive advantage. For this to happen the resource must be scarce and relevant. To be sustainable it has to be durable a not transferable or replicable.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Here one might choose reputation over technology. Choose sources of immobility in relation to resources like geographic or imperfect information as well as resources that loose its value in case they are detached from a complementary resource. In case the resource cannot be replicated it must be built, which is a lot harder.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then comes the question who gets the gains. This is especially hard with human resources where capabilities are often tightly tied with the humans themselves (bad humans!!! ;)).&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#8230; now lets put them to work&#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Identifiy them&#8230; from the demand and/or supply side. Take a broad look.
Step 2: Appraise them &#8230; based on importance and relative strength (benchmarking). You should link importance in your industry with our strengths. Here you can build a matrix with Strategic importance on the x-achsis and relative strength on the y-achsis. Here you can place your resources and capabilities into the 4 fields: zone of irrelevance, key weaknesses, superfluous strengths and key strengths.
Step 3: Develop them &#8230; exploit you key strengths, manage your weaknesses (make them into strengths, outsource or defend), think about what to do about your superfluous strengths.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &#8230; now we develop them further &#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Here the most often used method is gap analysis. There are several things you could also do: replicate them (like McDonalds) or develop new ones.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This is often hard as existing ones are based on routines and routines are hard to brake. Future capabilities are highly influenced by the past of a company. To develop them you could:
- develop the individual ones that make up the organizational capability
- acquire them (risky as they need to be integrated)
- use strategic alliances
- incubate them in sub-units (need to be brought back into the business)
- use product sequencing in which you use experience gained to build new things and gain more experience.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Commentary: There is a nice graphic at the end of the chapter which summarieses everything very well. I suggest writing that down&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The appendix talks about knowledge management and its importance.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday was the day. After several years I was playing drums again and it was a blast. I loved it and it worked better than I would have thought, with a few problems of course :) We actually made music sometimes, even though I mostly made sounds and even the group sometimes made more sounds than music. :) Now I am wondering though if I should go back into making music more often. In case I would, I would have to spend a bit more time on practicing, or rather, any time and time is something that is in high demand at the moment.</p>

A few examples: &quot;&lt;I&gt;A third of the American public believes U.S. forces found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, according to a recent poll, and 22 percent said Iraq actually used chemical or biological weapons. But no such weapons have been found, nor is there evidence they were used recently in Iraq. Before the war, half of those polled in a survey said Iraqis were among the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11, 2001. But most of them were from Saudi Arabia. None were Iraqis.&lt;/I&gt;&quot;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today seems to be a nice day for mobile news it seems. For one, Nokia has put me into problems now with the announcement of the <a href="http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/3699.html">6600</a>, something very close to the Siemens SX1 which I am thinking of getting as my next phone. This thing looks truely nice. Damn. Depending on the delay of the SX1 the 6600 looks very interesting. Of course, 4th quarter with Nokia always means end of 4th quarter, which makes it likely that the SX1 comes out first.</p>

<p>At the same time Iambic released a new version of <a href="http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/3701.html">Agendus</a> which again looks interesting. It&#8217;s probably the best PIM application for the Palm and it is getting better.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://www.brighthand.com/article/AOL_Picks_Sidekick_Over_RIM">AOL will offer the Danger Sidekick</a>, or Hiptop, which is a big boost for Danger and great to say the least. The problem with getting this thing in Europe is that it <a href="http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000600.php">needs a flatrate</a> and I don&#8217;t see European carriers offering that any time soon. Sad really.</p>
