  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Originally published on <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em /&gt;Here the focus is on the near environment, which needs to be understood for the strategy to be deliverable. Kotler (1980) found four environments of importance: task (e.g. suppliers), competitive, public (e.g. institutions) and macro (e.g. social forces) enviromnents.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The far environment can be judged by the STEP (also known as PEST and some might know STEEP which adds Ecological) factors but it needs to be understood that these factors all interact. The factors are also context specifica and Fahey and Narayanan (1986) argued that the driving forces behind them need to be understood.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The near environment is filled with parties of frequent interaction. Here, each organisation will have its own set of interactions, especially if looking beyond the direct rivals into the broader picture. Companies should in the near-term focus on similar companies while companies with different capabilities provide the biggest threat in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry Structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To develop a competitive strategy, we need to understand both our customers and competitors, hence the market we are competing in. Analysis of this is based on different methods which are explained in the Set Book from page 64 to 102. A major part of this is Porter&#8217;s five forces model, which helps to find things like critical success factors, as well as to understand the industry one is competing in.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Porter&#8217;s model gives you inforamtion on the attractiveness of the industry you are targetting, meaning potential profitability for you (see book 2)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Looking at all 5 forces, and changes between them, gives us a way of finding potential added value. As industry structures are changing, the models only work for a limited time. Porter&#8217;s model describes not predicts. Changes in the industry, changes its boundaries and structure which likely leads to the need for new strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;(Next comes the Electrolux case, which will be referred to at several places within the book. )&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Industry structure is only a starting point though, especially as all these models only provide a view, not the view of an industry. Rumelt (1991) found that most variation in organisational performance comes from differences between businesses rather than general industry attractiveness. Of course there are industries where the effect is bigger, but they are rare.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;(Started with a Mini-Case of the European Food-Processing industry)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;These are clusters of firms within an industry following the same or similar strategy (McGee, 1985).&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Members of strategic groups are not equally capable though. The grouping comes mostly from a special configuration of resources common to the group. These create so called mobility barriers. They also offer protection of imitation from outside the group. McGee (1985) called them costs of imitation.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic space and industry dynamics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Industry dynamics involve the decaying of mobility barriers due to changes in the significance of different resources (see food-market case).&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To build a strategic group map, you need to choose two different important factors for a chart (e.g. geographic coverage and marketing costs) and place the different strategic groups of one to n companies within that chart.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Strategic space was introduced by McGee and Segal-Horn (1990, 1992). They take the strategic groups concept but do not place companies in the chart. They rather create a system of areas of opportunity within that chart for any given industry. These might not be available yet but could be in the future (e.g. non-branch banks). A strategist has to find a space and decide if it presents a viable strategy now or perhaps in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry participants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To understand participants strategies, we need to look at their intentions, decisions and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intentions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Information can be gained from published remarks, annual reports and official statements of philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Kuhn (1962) suggested looking at how companies habitually act. This can be seen in:
- flexibility and responsiveness to customers
- aggressive  or trustworthy or co-operative in competitive environment
- notice of strategic threats and speed of reacting to challenges&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Decisions are made against the background set by industry structure. If we understand the freedom of choices and look at their choices, then we can possibly deduct their future competitive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your product or service is not cheaper than anyone else&#8217;s, or better than anyone else&#8217;s or you don&#8217;t serve me better or more conveniently than anyone else, why on earth should I prefer you to your competitors? - Porter 1994&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;How can this be achieved?&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;a. Deciding to specialise (e.g. strong branding, specialised sales force, dominating niche markt, &#8230;): Customers need to have distinct needs and be willing to pay a premium.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;b. Deciding to seek lowest-cost production: Deliver those value-added elements below a competitors price. This could be quality too. Economies of scale, accumulation of experience, superior operational logistics and a cost cutting culture can be important here.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;c. Deciding to focus: There is high knowledge about what the customers wants needed here.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;d. Decisions and industry structure: There is an interplay between the sources of advantage available and the decisions made.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Strategies that the participants are capable of carrying out. This needs concetration of resources and capabilities. You need to:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;a. Understand the competitor&#8217;s market segment as the capabilities need to fit.
b. Understand teh differences between value generating processes
c. Look for patterns of competitive behaviour. It is important to also look at competitors with a different approach to value generation.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applying competitor-analysis techniques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Here the example of Electrolux is taken, which I will leave out here, as with all case studies.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interaction in the industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;One form of interaction is competition and this is very dependent on the individual scenario but some generic strategies are:
- surprise (for short-term advantage)
- timing
- maximum use of resources
- vigour and skill&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The other form is co-operation, a form that Hamel and Prahalad (1994) argued will be more important in many future opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.benews.com">BeNews</a> is still getting hits these days. The site isn&#8217;t online anymore, but as you see from the above URL, archive.org still has it in their catalogue, obviously, being an archive ;)</p>

<p>Today this comes from <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=3692">an article</a> on OSNews by Eugenia about YellowTABs revival of BeOS. For all those wondering what I am talking about. BeNews was a news site about BeOS that I was a part of for a long time until we pulled the plug. BeOS was an operating system that just rocked, but it still failed. The rest of the story would be too long for now, other than saying some people are trying to revive it. And hey, I wish them luck and especially fun.</p>

<p>I just found it&#8217;s interesting to see how many hits archive.org can generate for a site.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish and prioritise the organisations&#8217; purposes and objectives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the relationship between and the power of stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up negotiation and conflict mechanisms to reconcile stakeholder differences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;purpose and objectives which constrain organisational structures and control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;It is very important to understand the true purpose of an organisation as it highly influences its actions and therefor the competitive landscape.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The books ads a few things to what strategy is about, being the need to balance stakeholder relationships, producing above average returns, politics and power as well as culture and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of an organisation reflects it&#8217;s &quot;raison d&#8217;etre&quot; [sorry, missing all the accents here for those who speak / write french ;)] and might be written down in a vision statement. This is normally not something that is measurable. Objectives are the things that are more specific than a vision and also more short term and measurable. Policies then are something like decision rusles for recurring contingencies, bringing a little bit consistency to strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Public mission statements (or purpose statements) of big companies will reveal their pupose (and long-term objectives) to shareholders. They should help to give a sense of direction.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Purpose Statements will normally take into account social responsibility, depending on the extent they matter to key stakeholders and the importance of that stakeholder group.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The mission needs to match strategy, purpose, values and behaviour standards to really have a good effect. Personal and organisational vlaues need to match. They are unique to each organisation.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Eccles and Nohria (1992) suggest that an organisations language has a direct effect on both it&#8217;s strategic actions and it&#8217;s identity. It can therefor said to be a tool to develop a strategy and identity.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing the purposes and objectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to determine the purpose and objective without understanding the various stakeholder positions. A stakeholder analysis might be called a &quot;contributor and claimant&quot; analysis. Etzioni (1971) categorised the reasons for participation in a company as follows:
- coercion (you have to)
- mutual benefition exchange
- identification with the values, norms and beliefs of the company&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;As simplification, one can concentrate on economic goals for sahreholders and other stakeholders with a monetary insterest. The problem here is that you need to agree on what kind of profitability you mean for you company:
- accounting returns
- cash returns
- economic profit and rents (where rents are returns above general market profit)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In the stockmarket, shareholder values or EPV (Economic Value Added) does not directly link to the share price either:
- the amoutn of shares traded each da are only a % of the total
- discounts will be attached to the stock for multiple reasons
- market imperfections&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This only works if you have shareholders. In a public or charitable organisation everything is a lot more about a fulfilment of purpose while taking into account the potential wishes of important stakeholders (donors want to know that they did good and you need to tell them that they did and what they did)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In the end, an adequate return to the resource provider is what you need. You can do a cost-benefit analysis or look at efficiency and effectiveness. Opportunity Costs in relation to alternatives should be taken into account though.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The course book states that managers are agents to the owners. Their purpose might be:
- Baumol (1966): prestige from high market share
- Marris (1964): Power and reward by growing assets
- Williamsen (1974): status and empire building via salary and perks
- Galbraith (1967): growth, independence, challange&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I would like to differ. The purpose of individuals is individual. Should be clear via the word alone. Some might really fit into the above scheme though.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;What needs to be done though, is the alignement of managerial and ownership interests. This could be done through monitoring, incentive, sanctions, auditing and encouraging takeovers [that last one is a tough one but interesting point ;)]&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Personal Rant: They give Berkshire Hathaway as an example but my personal opinion is that what makes Berkshire Hathaway so special is expertise and honesty. Monitoring, Auditing and encouraging takeovers are none existent. Incentives and sanctions are there but then again, the man that calls the shots has something like 30 Billion USDs in personal wealth. It&#8217;s not like it would really really hurt if the stock drops 50%. Based on 50% of his net worth being in BH, he would then have about 22 Billion USD. Great company though and especially great man/investor that Warren Buffet is. &#8212; End Personal Rant&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders are more and more getting important in relation to shareholders. In a knowledge society, that carriers of knowledge become more important than the carriers of capital, as capital becomes more replaceable than knowledge. Takeovers are not easy and customer relationships are of prime importance for lasting success.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Companies are &quot;non-zero-sum&quot; games though, meaning that collaboration increases the value for all. By attending to all stakeholder needs management can make a bigger cake (Baden-Full).&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Contract theory can be used to look at stakeholder collaboration. Kay (1993) found three different &quot;contracts&quot;:
- spot contracts: short, standard terms ala &quot;I sell, you buy and that is that.&quot; There is no long-term commitment.
- classical contracts: brings certainty for longer commitments; in case of switching costs, the parties want to make sure that there is no termination of the relationship; investments need to be secured.
- relational contracts: long-term; less formal; expectations go beyond legal contract; trust; dependence&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Which contract is best comes down to:
- classical contracts are needed to make things binding while relational contracts are more about co-operation. Relational contracts also need flexibility and free flow of information. You acknowledge that you are both important for each other.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Returns on resources and to stakeholders should also look at market imperfections. In a perfect market, resources lead to a normal rate of return for veryone. Imperfections can, if exploited, lead to above average returns as some organisations will have a distinct or unique advantage. Bad performance will lead to shareholders moving elsewhere. Competition will be there for scarce resources.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Morgan (1986) identified 12 sources of stakeholder power:
- Formal authority
- Control over scarce resources
- Organisational structures and procedures
- Control of decision process
- Control of knowledge and information
- Boundary management
- Ability to manage uncertainty
- Control of technology
- Alliances and informal networks
- Countervailing power
- Symbolism and management of meaning
- Gender power&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Phones are getting more and more advanced these days. Some even have polyphonic ring tones that sound just like real life and some even have voice control, which means that the user can make up key-words that will do something, like picking up the phone. Some of the phones have both.</p>

<p>This is what proved to be interesting in a case <a href="http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/3613.html">cited on infoSync</a>. Somebody at a wonderful night out with his girlfriend had his SonyEricsson P800 with him&#8230; with a ring tone that, interestingly enough, had the word &quot;answer&quot; in it&#8230; which was his magic key-word to pick up the phone &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; You guessed it, somebody called. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is going on and on doesn&#8217;t it, and me, I just don&#8217;t stop either. I can&#8217;t sorry. This thing is just too interesting. Here is a nice article from the Guardian about the current discussion. Here a quote:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt; Weblogs, by their nature (simple web pages with content that often relies, for context and richness, on numerous links, updated regularly) are bound to attract the attention of Google - a search that works partly by freshness, party by analysing page structure (the simpler the better) and mainly by looking at the links within those pages.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seems that Kim &quot;<a href="http://www.kimble.org/">Kimble</a>&quot; Schmitz, is now going Money Printing. His newest venture <a href="http://www.trendax.com/">Trendax</a>, also known as &quot;The Money Making Machine&quot; is said to be a computer based system with artificial intelligence that will trade things on the stock market &#8230; and he promises returns of 25 and up to 50% per year.</p>

<p>People out there! Let me tell you one thing! This is not possible. Period. In case he would succeed then everyone would do it and by nature of statistics, everybody, including him, would be back at an average growth rate. It just doesn&#8217;t work. &#8216;nuff said.</p>
