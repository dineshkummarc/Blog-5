These things will allow new interactions to form, data to flourish and flow freely and totally new applications to be built. Add XML-RPC based publishing solutions via MovableType or similar tools to the list and the opportunities are endless. I am wondering if this will not get us the information closer to our fingertipps than ever before.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just read <a href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b01/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=5100">The Chinese Negotatiation</a> from <a href="http://www.hbsp.harvard.edu/">Harvard Business Review</a>. It&#8217;s a very good article on what you need to know when negotiating in China. Here are some of the key concepts to get an idea.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>First of all, the roots in chinese culture come from working in agriculture, where long cycles are the norm and where family relations are of utmost importance. On top of that, things are greatly influenced by Confucius and Lao Tsu, both of whom were more concerned with the means than the end. Also, Chinese are better at taking into account the big picture and are very weary of foreigners.</p>

<p>For negotiations, there are 8 concepts to take into account.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Guanxi, meaning personal connections and then some. It&#8217;s all about personal standing within your total environment, taking into account chinese importance on family and friends. Also important here is long-term reciprocity, with favors never being forgotten but not being returned at once.</p></li>
<li><p>Zhongjian Ren, the intermediary. This is somebody who introduces you to your potential business partners and who knows them and will be of major importance to getting a deal done.</p></li>
<li><p>Shehui Dengji, the social status. The high level executives will not bargain as it is not their role, but pay attention to not send too young people to meet important older ones in China as their social standing needs to be at least equal.</p></li>
<li><p>Renji Hexie is about interpersonal harmony being very important, it holds relationships of equals together. This takes a long time to establish and chinese are patient!</p></li>
<li><p>Zhengti Guannian is about holistic thinking, and only when the small things are settled and understood can the chinese think about the entire package.</p></li>
<li><p>Jiejian is translated to thrift, meaning that there is a very high savings mentality, translating to a lot of bargaining over price through haggling.</p></li>
<li><p>Mianzi is about &quot;face&quot; or social capital. It is very important for a chinese to not &quot;loose face&quot;, loose their dignity of prestige.</p></li>
<li><p>Chiku Nailao is about endurance and relentlessness, something that Chinese value highly, meaning you will have to have a lot of standing power to endure long negotiations and little sleep.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>It&#8217;s really a very good article and I highly suggest reading it to get more insight and some good examples of what it all means.</p>

It&#8217;s actually a very nice diagram to begin thinking a bit along the lines of what will change this world we are living in. What will be the drivers of changes coming tomorrow. I still have to think a bit if I agree with him or not though and I might be partitioning the space a little bit differently, but that needs some free processing time in my brain which is currently occupied. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have to agree with Scoble here. RSS can allow you to read a lot of sites out there at amazing speed. It works a lot better than a browser where you need to open each site and kind of find out what&#8217;s new. <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/10/18.html#a5107">Check his points</a> for some good explanations though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just found a very good interview via <a href="http://www.design-management.de/">Ralf&#8217;s site</a> about <a href="http://www.conference-board.org/articles/atb_article.cfm?id=210">understanding failure</a>. It&#8217;s done with Sydney Finkelstein, professor of strategy and leadership at Dartmouth&#8217;s Tuck School of Business and author of &quot;Why Smart Executives Fail and What You Can Learn From Their Mistakes (Portfolio)&quot; and David L. Dotlich, co-author of &quot;Why CEOs Fail: The 11 Behaviors That Can Derail Your Climb to the Top-and How to Manage Them (Jossey-Bass)&quot;.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;Dotlich: [&#8230;] All leaders who fail do so for one of two reasons: what they do, including the decisions they make, and who they are-how they handle the leadership role: whether they listen, how they treat people. I think character is destiny. The higher you go, the more significant that factor is in the destiny of an organization. The higher you go, I tell CEOs, the funnier your jokes get, the brighter your insights, the smarter your strategy. But at that level, people don&#8217;t tell you things. Good CEOs surround themselves with people who tell the truth; they have a learning orientation. But we have created an environment where we have made CEOs into heroes and princes. In many cases, it&#8217;s almost impossible to tell them the truth.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;Finkelstein: Remarkable about some of the interviews was that there was a fair amount of honesty. For instance, Quaker CEO William Smithburg, with respect to Quaker and Snapple, admitted, &quot;We should have had another team looking at the no side of the Quaker deal. We were so gung-ho that we thought that this was another Gatorade.&quot; But they didn&#8217;t, and it wasn&#8217;t.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Sometimes the interview is a bit blurry but that&#8217;s just strategy and leadership I believe. The entire topic is a bit blurry and unclear. That&#8217;s what makes it so hard.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A &lt;a title=&quot;Tablet PC fees hard to swallow | CNET News.com&quot; href=&quot;http://rss.com.com/2100-1005_3-5095467.html?part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=news&quot;&gt;News.com article&lt;/a&gt; reveals that MS is getting hefty license fees for their TabletPC Version of XP. Check this quote of Acer President Wang Chen-tang:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;&quot;The cost of a tablet PC is $200 (7,000 Taiwan dollars) more than its notebook counterpart. Of this difference, the hardware cost is only between $30 and $60. The majority of the difference comes from the OS license,&quot; said Wang. &quot;We have tried to negotiate the fee with Microsoft several times in vain. It&#8217;s very regrettable.&quot; &lt;/I&gt;</p>

I actually like the 6230 which is supposed to have bluetooth, radio, mp3 player and the like. Small and full featured if you still want to carry a palm to surf and check e-mail. Still going for the 6600 but interested none the less. The most important point might be that Nokia could do a move to allow more co-branding with carriers, which is something that carriers are complaining about as they want more force for their own brand. Co-Branding will likely be a good move there.</p>
