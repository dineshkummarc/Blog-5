  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have to say that from time to time MS really knows how to build something that is nice. My old mouse broke down and it was a real pain moving the mouse pointer around. Saturday I bought an MS Intellimouse Explorer 3, the optical one and I have to say that I love it. It works so much better than any other mouse I have used! Plain wonderful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that Anssi Vanjoki, one of the Nokia board members has a speeding ticket and is fined 116000 eur! He drove 75 Km/h when only 50 km/h were allowed.</p>

<p>In finland though, the fine you pay is in relation to your salary and as you might guess Mr Vanjoki made some nice bundle in 1999.</p>

<p>During an argument on TMF I read something that I would like to share because it shows you that the Finish system is a really good one.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;Well, perhaps it feels easier to understand if you consider it as a form of community service. It just makes more sense to have Mr Vanjoki serving his time working in the Nokia management instead of ordering him to help old people in a rest home (or something like that). That&#8217;s what this fine after all is supposed to mean, a period of time at work (the duration is determined by the seriousness of the offence) without a pay. &lt;/I&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finished reading Gonzo Marketing by Christopher Locke a few days ago and I must say that I like it. I thought I&#8217;d give you a short summary. Many of your will be interested especially as LiveJournal would be one of those Micromarkets, or enablers for such markets, that he is talking about.</p>

<p>He starts by complaining the customization is not personalization but still mass marketing. You are still looking at group preferences that you guess is there. Saying: &quot;Dear John, &#8230;&quot; does not make an e-mail personal.</p>

<p>Harvard Business Review included it in their list of the top 10 books of 2001 that made them think.</p>

<p>Important here is that people look at things differently. We might be interested in the same &quot;Category&quot; but that does not mean we are interested in the same thing.</p>

<p>So let me look a bit closer at the book.</p>

<p>Something that is important in the future is collaborative filtering which you can see on amazon in the &quot;People who read this book also liked&#8230;&quot; feature. Especially coupled with comments it helps us talk.</p>

<p>It is different from an Ad saying &quot;BUY THIS!&quot;.</p>

<p>To quote from the book:
&quot;on TV, repeated pitches may create brand awareness. On the web, they create brand annoyance. This isn&#8217;t the way we&#8217;re communicating with each other online. We argue, cajole, we joke, we talk. We tell each other stories. On television, a company has 60 seconds to be clever. But on the web, it has unlimited gigabytes to say what it&#8217;s all about and why anyone should give a damn. This isn&#8217;t a preview, like a TV ad. It&#8217;s the main feature. If you advertise to us on your site once you&#8217;ve gotten us there, you&#8217;ve lost a prime opportunity to engage us, to converse with us, to tell us a story. You&#8217;ve blown it and we won&#8217;t be back, no matter how big your banner budget.&quot;</p>

<p>Locke also put this a lot clearer by stating that &quot;online, the market is the competition&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;mass media are mass because they&#8217;re huge. And the way such hugeness is achieved is by appealing to the lowest-common-denominator-tastes in terms of programming content. The program, the content, is merely bait to draw the audience. The real show, the real message, is the advertising. &quot;</p>

<p>Journalism probably has their rule of being imparcial directly in relation to that. Companies don&#8217;t want to advertise next to views they can&#8217;t support. That&#8217;s my view now, but Locke goes on about this stupid impartial bit for an entire chapter. This will get harder for companies with the problem that people can very easily say what they think and people can see that. See LJ&#8217;s community during the Sept. 11th attacks. It was a wonderful area to get real views and real opinions and talk. Interact. Here you also see that Locke was one of the authors of the Cluetrain Manifesto.</p>

<p>The net changes that. It is here because of interest, of exchange, of stories.</p>

<p>Locke argues that companies need to tab in those micromarkets.</p>

<p>The problem with supporting Micromedia, which might become Micromarkets if you manage to sell to them, is that if 1/10 of 1% of revenue comes from 1 partner then you need 1000 of those partners for reaching the same level of revenue.</p>

<p>The money to support those partners comes out of the advertising budget and big companies can use employees as partners. Common interests unite people; be they customers or employees.</p>

<p>&quot;The fundamental message of marketing must change from &quot;we want your money&quot; to &quot;we share your interests&quot;. In this respect, corporate underwriting is a way - perhaps the only viable way at present - for companies to put their own money where their mouth is.&quot;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, today was a productive day it seems. I want to bed very early yesterday which resulted in finally being fully awake today for the entire day, starting around 8am, which is way early for me normally.</p>

<p>Of course, the video recorder did not record all of Event Horizon from yesterday, which drove me mad. But thankfully I took a look if all of it was on the tape as it would have been even worse if I noticed half way through the film.</p>

<p>I am currently trying to find a way for Dmail (from <a href="http://www.netwinsite.com/">Netwinsite</a>) to filter out all attachements that are sent to us (STATSnet) and send a reply saying to go to (http://blah/upload.php) to upload the file. This would get rid of a lot of the spam and help us not get a lot of the viri, which again would be wonderful. The problem is I found out how to filter them out but not how to emm&#8230; reply in the case they are filtered out, and that is a pain ;) I hope their mailing list can help. They should.</p>

<p>I am also currently trying to register with developer status at moreover.com to be able to parse their headlines or something. This seems to be possible somehow, but before getting approved I can&#8217;t say. I am visiting so many different sites each morning that I think there must be a better way. So I am trying to get moreover.com to get me a lot of headlines, then stuff like infosync.no, osnews.com, slashdot.org, theregister.com, &#8230; all those. The thing is that in most cases it will be enough to read the headline and you only end up reading one or two items. But otherwise I feel like I missed something ;)</p>

<p>I also wrote an LJ Style that will publish an RDF like file of your friends page, which would allow me to incorporate that too.</p>

<p>Just trying to get myself a lot more organized.</p>

<p>Also I did get a lot of paperwork out of the way today and my desk is getting cleaner again, which is feels wonderful.</p>

<p>Open University work is getting along nicely, currently close to finishing the last book and then there will be revision until the test on the 29th in Frankfurt. I really wonder why they had to not have a test in Neuss this time which would be so much closer to me. Damn! Ah well, I don&#8217;t know Frankfurt yet.</p>

<p>Sadly my tutor also told us today that she will not be our tutor in the Diploma course but that we will get a new one. She is getting some other group (possibly). This is very sad as this tutor was just plain amazing, I will have to keep in contact. I am looking forward to meeting the next one though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on infoSync) It&#8217;s a mess! Currently, all GSM phones can send SMS text messages, and if you have a Nokia phone you can also send and receive ring-tones and bitmaps - to other Nokia phones, that is. Others wanted their phones to have that capability too though, especially because ring tones and images are a lucrative business. Now, manufacturers such as Ericsson and Siemens have adopted a messaging standard called EMS in some phones. Nokia didn&#8217;t, arguing (maybe rightfully so) that their phones can already do what EMS has to offer. Result: nobody dares to use the damn thing because you have no clue if it will arrive at a phone that supports you type of message.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>The business for ring tones, images, screensavers and the like is booming, with companies previously doing only adult entertainment now jumping on the running train, which really shows that there is money to be made. People love these things, and I recently saw a Siemens ad which was trying to make it clear to the viewer that the Siemens C45 can be customized with ring tones, to fit the user&#8217;s personality. Another ad I saw was from Nokia saying something along the lines of &quot;soon you will be able to watch videos on your Nokia mobile phone.&quot; All these companies are trying to hammer it into your head that your phone is capable of more than voice calls and sms messages.</p>

<p>But, if you send an image, or a ring tone, from a Nokia phone to a Siemens phone, then you will get 3 or more SMS messages with a seemingly random collection of letters. The sender of course pays for 3 SMS messages without even knowing. For all he knows he just sent a nice image of a birthday cake.</p>

<p>What does that tell us? Among other things that the maximum size of SMS messages is to small. We need the option of sending big chunks of data to a phone that understands them. Things like colour photos from home, a short video clip from the first steps of your daughter, an MP3 sound byte with the best wishes for your birthday from your parents - and the list goes on. We also need another billing method that works in relation to the size of the message. Some GPRS phones already have an entry in their preferences called &quot;SMS over GPRS&quot;, but this is not yet enabled by most operators.</p>

<p>The great saviour from all of this mess might be a new standard called Multimedia Messaging Service, or MMS in short, which is now accepted by all (or at least all significant) mobile devices manufacturers and carriers as the next messaging standard to be used. MMS will let users of supportive devices send and receive messages with not only text but also graphics, images as well as audio and video clips. Yes, you read that correctly. Video sequences, audio clips and high-quality images will be able to be sent from and to MMS enabled phones. It&#8217;s a new world of messaging!</p>

<p>MMS supports the following formats (partial list):
GIF and JPEG
MPEG-4
MP3, WAV and MIDI</p>

<p>Of course, not every mobile phone will be able to receive MMS messages from the very beginning, which is why the so-called Multimedia Messaging Service Centres (MMS-C) can route MMS messages to different destinations. This can be a mobile terminal or a web page and in the case of sending the MMS message to a web page, the MMS-C will send a standard SMS message to the receiver to tell them of an arrived multimedia message and how to reach it.</p>

<p>Now, since we are already talking about e-mail, there are a few changes in MMS that make it a bit more like e-mail. One of those things is that you will have CC (carbon copy) and BCC (blind carbon copy) fields. But let&#8217;s get a bit more technical to understand what is really happening, because some interesting things turn up there. For one, MMS messages are pushed to your phone with the help of a system called WAP Push, which also uses the WAP Gateway/Proxy to talk to your phone. Push is available in WAP starting with version 1.2. Many users might not want huge amounts of data sent to their phone - which they will possibly have to pay for - to be pushed to them every few minutes, especially on their birthday when thousands of friends send them the last birthday greeting video. Introducing: MMS On-Demand Push. This is a method where the MMS message is stored on a server, while you are sent an SMS message to alert you of the arrival. You can then decide if you want to read it now or later, much like checking your e-mail.</p>

<p>Whoa, hang on a minute there, some people will say now. SMS messages go over an extra signalling channel and will the WAP Push be happening over that channel? Nope. That&#8217;s probably one of the bigger differences compared with SMS, and also the reason why you need at least GPRS capabilities in the networks. MMS runs over IP based mobile networks and needs the possibility of bandwidth based billing. It will not use the SMS signalling channel. This is possible since new 3G networks have vastly higher capacities than 2G networks, so that the extra use of the traffic channel will not be a problem for the networks. You will need to have a phone that operates in the Class-A mode in GPRS though, which means that the GPRS link stays active even when you are doing other things.</p>

<p>MMS messages will also not use a specific protocol, but instead WAP and general Internet protocols like SMTP, HTTP, MIME and others. SMTP and MIME will link the Multimedia Messaging Service Environment to your device making MMS kind of like a presentation layer for basic e-mail protocols. The first systems will be based on WAP protocols though.</p>

<p>An important part of MMS will also be something like revenue sharing between the carriers and third parties, especially as many of the first messages will be originating from Internet connected PCs.</p>

<p>Many people will now say that the close similarities to e-mail will enable spamming mobile phones beyond current comprehension - and in general, I agree. This becomes even clearer once you find out that there is a user profile with MMS which you can manage via an Internet connection. You will be able to decide which media types to get directly and which to leave on the server for later pick-up via the internet, when to receive notifications and, now get read, include filtering rules and routing tables for unsolicited and undesirable messages. Whee.</p>

<p>All in all, the introduction of MMS will bring us one standard for all phones with the back-up via e-mail communication. This might really bring us new possibilities in relation to things we can send with our phones. With that, things will get a bit more dangerous in relation to spam - but like they say, you can&#8217;t have your cake and eat it too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on infoSync) I can be categorized as a geek, or as a technology addict, never reading a manual, out of stupidity or knowledge, always using devices to their almost maximum ability, always on the lookout for the latest gadget (send me one if you have one ;). In short, I am not the general public.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>The general public is often clueless as to what their phone can really do for them and most of the times they were never told when they first bought the phone. I can change my ringtone? I can group my callers and assign different ringtones for different groups? I can send what messages? That weird beep is when I get one of those messages? I can surf WAP pages? What are WAP pages? I can just say somebody&#8217;s name and the phone dials that person? I can send someone else a ringtone? I have a calendar in here? I can synchronize the calendar with Outlook on my computer? Questions on top of questions - on top of questions.</p>

<p>Mobile phones are not only phones anymore, but are increasingly becoming versatile multimedia devices that can do a lot of different things. If carriers want to improve their ARPU (Average Revenue per User), then they really need to tell all of their customers what they can really do with their phones. Another group of companies that could be doing that are the mobile device manufacturers, possibly through things like Club Nokia. Actually, the latter scenario might be the best one as it would further help companies like Nokia to set themselves appart from the industry. If they managed their customer relations well through Club Nokia, give them the right push in the right direction and get them to use advanced features like sending ring tones, then they would help carriers to make more money through Nokia users than other phone users (such as Siemens, Motorola, Sony Ericsson and soforth). This makes for an important sales pitch when pushing a new phone in the distribution chain. Vodafone wants a high ARPU and if Nokia users bring higher ARPU than Siemens users then they will increase the reductions on Nokia phones to entice users to use such systems.</p>

<p>The exact same thing can of course apply for other companies, and as an example, Siemens is building up a service similar to Club Nokia for Siemens users. Meanwhile, a German carrier called T-Mobile is building up a system called Happy Digits where people will be able to get Happy Digits (aka points) for using their phones. All that these companies really need is a big database of mobile phone users containing their interests, their level of knowledge and what phone model they are using.</p>

<p>But what could they really do with it? How would they be able to make users use these systems? There are really lots of possibilities. Newsletters would be one. Why is Siemens not contacting me every month about cool things in relation to my current phone - which might even entice me to use some new features? They could for example send me 3 free ring tones and an explanation on how the system works to get more ringtones from their pages. my-siemens.com actually has a place to download ring tones, and they just need to tell me (or rather the general public) that it&#8217;s there, let me try it out, let me use it, show me the ropes. This makes me as their customer happy, drives up revenue from that site in the long run and makes the carrier happy as their users use this system more frequently. In this case they probably don&#8217;t contact me because they don&#8217;t know me. But the point remains, and there are other options as well.</p>

<p>Run advertisements across the Internet or on TV advertising features. Send SMS messages with special items. Here would be an example: &quot;Use the &quot;Send ringtone&quot; feature on Club Nokia once within this month and win a brand new VW Beetle. You can find the usage explanation by clicking going to &#8230;&quot; If you have 500.000 users there and only 50.000 do what they are asked for, that results in each user spending about 2 EUR per ring tone - which makes it very likely to get some hooked on the service and a lot of others interested, and have the VW Beetle well paid for. Alternatively, they could say that you need to go to 2000 points in some WAP game by Friday to take part in a drawing for a Playstation 2 with 3 games. The idea basket is bottomless.</p>

<p>Some companies have already begun moving in that direction - for example, I saw several Motorola ads at the Heathrow in London advertising that you can have MasterCard on your phone, whereas Nokia recently ran the Nokia Game to get people to see the multimedia side of things. Siemens is currently running ads all over the place, hammering it into peoples heads that the new C45 can be customized to reflect a user&#8217;s personality with ringtones, covers and more.</p>

<p>I also remember that T-Mobile, then still T-D1, used to mail me some sort of informational brochure with each account statement telling me about things like handset sales or the answer machine service in the network. What I&#8217;m talking about, however, is more about how to use your mobile phone. That thing in your hand. I am also not talking about corporate marketing mailing but a way to engage customers to think about it, to talk about it, to try it out because it is something that they think they would like to use - not because it is advertised in 20 colors with big buzz words.</p>

<p>If you give it some thought, you&#8217;re more than likely to notice that the first steps towards what I am describing are already being taken. The problem is that it isn&#8217;t going far enough yet - not by far - or we would not be in the current situation. There&#8217;s still a lot of work that has to be done in regard of telling mobile phone users about the capabilities of their devices and the services available to them, and as they say, you can&#8217;t make money without spending money. Spending money is something that a lot of companies with huge debt are not willing to do at this time, though.</p>

<p>The thing is that getting in touch with users will become even more important in the future, when companies begin releasing phones where the software can be upgraded, which in turn will require manufacturers to really keep in contact with their customers. If a new software upgrade will enable a lot of new features in the phone, then manufacturers need to tell users about all of the new features. The device or phone essentially stays the same, the only difference is that its features change. If you think this is confusing now, just wait a few years and you&#8217;ll see what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>

<p>Speaking of new features, have you begun thinking of all the possibilities that will appear once MMS shows up in our mobile phones? I have, but more on that next time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I said it. Copy protection of CDs sucks. In many ways and my favority comes here. I bought the new No Doubt CD, which I really like. I also have an Archos Jukebox (6 GIG harddisk portable MP3 player) and I generally want my CDs in MP3 form. And what do you know, the No Doubt CD is copy protected which means I cannot rip the CD tracks of and encode them as MP3.</p>

<p>I somehow think this is not fair. I bought the damn CD and I want to be entitled to have them in another format if I so desire. I can even copy the CD if I want (CloneCD works wonderfully) but I can&#8217;t get the WAV files and encode them. Grrrr&#8230; really pissed at the moment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wanted to possibly buy the new No Doubt CD yesterday so I went into one of the big chains called Saturn, which is about the same size as Media Markt and both of these belong to the same company, but that is another story.</p>

<p>I kind of wanted to listen to the CD before buying it though so I asked somebody running around there where I could listen to the CD. He said, at any of these stations with headphones on the CD racks. Yeah right, I&#8217;ll run around the entire shop looking for the place where the No Doubt CD is on. That&#8217;s when I stopped to read.</p>

<p>&quot;Take your CD and hold the bar code at the bottom of the CD under the red light.&quot;</p>

<p>I wondered, could it be? Could somebody have really put something like this up? How long would it take?</p>

<p>I put on the headphones. Put the CD under the scanner. Instantly, and I mean instantly, it took nothing more than 1 second tops, the first song from the CD started playing. It&#8217;s not the entire song, it&#8217;s just something like 30 seconds. Then a voice says &quot;2&quot; and you have the next song, I would presume from second 30 to 60 or something.</p>

<p>I have to say that I was positively surprised at a good way of using technology and I put another 10 CDs under this thing which I would have never thought about buying. I could resist buying them but it was close. It will be getting closer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I have my Euros now. Beyond the starter pack that is. I just went into the local Aldi to get some orange juice and some other things. Cost a total of about 8 DEM. The cashier asked me if I wanted to pay in DEM or EUR or both (boy they are good :)) and I said DEM. She then asked if I wanted to give her all my DEM. I told her I had 171 DEM with me. No problem. So I paid 8 DEM with 17something DEM and got 79 EUR back :)</p>

<p>I am now all EUR.</p>

<p>Which might be a problem. The coca-cola machine inside the hotel where my gf works should accept EUR now. The only problem is that the coin slot is too thin for the 50 cents piece, which is what a cola costs ;) What a joke. They were all standing there in amazement trying to get the coin in.</p>
