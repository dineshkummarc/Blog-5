  <div class="entry-content"><p>Something innovative by the KVB in Cologne, who run the Metro and Busses and things in Cologne. You can now pay for your ticket with your mobile phone. You just call a free number and hang up after somebody wishes you a good journey. Your number needs to be transmitted, that&#8217;s all. You will then get an SMS confirmation. The very cool thing is that they will make you the best deal automatically. If you order 4 single tickets (2 EUR each), you get a bill for a FourWay Ticket (6,80 EUR). Now how cool is that.</p>

<p>Now comes the problem. You will have to register with <a href="http://www.teltix.de/">Teltix</a> or inside a KVB office to use this service. Then your bill will come once a month. This is still nicer than paying cash each time of course. But registering is annoying and I somehow feel it is useless if they were to bill the phone directly, but they don&#8217;t seem to be doing that.</p>

<p>The only people who will get around this, are people who are at T-Mobile and already have their <a href="http://www.t-mobil.de/mobilwallet">Mobile Wallet</a> enabled.  I think I need a mobile wallet ;)</p>

<p>(Not that I don&#8217;t have a monthly subscription for KVB and don&#8217;t need a ticket but a geek is a geek.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;There we have it. <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">Typepad</a> goes 1.5. The post about it is <a href="https://www.typepad.com/resources/2004/11/rich_text_editi.html">here</a> which gives a bit of detail on the different new things.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;WYSIWYG Editor, which I am using now. This one is actually fairly nice but I am not a big fan of WYSIWYG Editors because it&#8217;s not really true, simply because I have an idea about the HTML Code I&#8217;d like to see behind it ;) Being a Mac user at home, and with this not being supported in Safari, I will stick to lots of clean code.&lt;strong&gt; Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Looks like the code&amp;nbsp; looks really nice. I might be using this thing afterall. Now I want keyboard shortcuts :)&lt;/li&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;li&gt;All us Typepaders now have a Spell Checker, so expect less spelling mistakes in this wide blogging world out there.&lt;/li&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;li&gt;Quickpost also has the WYSIWYG Editor, which is a nice. It&#8217;s probably the thing I use most to post to my blogs.&lt;/li&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;under reported &lt;/em&gt;item: The file manager has been reworked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;All in all a few nice additions and likely some cool changes in the background too, but the most striking thing is the file manager. This one now displays HTML and CSS files. What does that mean? You can put your entire web site on Typepad as long as you don&#8217;t need PHP or MySQL or anything of that sort. But a friend of mine will publish a new book and this just makes Typepad a very nice host for the site about his book. Any extra pages can just be uploaded. Very good move there.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;All this co-insides very nicely with the release of <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,1522,,00.html?orig=/lifeblog">Lifeblog 1.5</a> by Nokia which <a href="http://www.christianlindholm.com/christianlindholm/2004/11/lifeblog_15_is_.html">Christian blogged about</a>. The <a href="http://www.nokia.com/aboutnokia/press/nmc2004/pressreleases/Nokia_Lifeblog.pdf">press release</a> (pdf) stats that Lifeblog uses Atom to post things to Blog hosts like Typepad. All you really need is a compatible Atom posting interface I presume. This might really push new users into Typepad once the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,65362,00.html">Nokia 3230</a> comes out and gets Lifeblog enabled. This is one of the reasons why Typepad really needed this new WYSIWYG editor. Good to see it all fits together nicely. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok this kicks! I just read <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/52849">here</a> that Be Inc. founder Jean-Louis GassÃ©e has become Chairman of the Board of <a href="http://www.palmsource.com/">PalmSource</a>! You can check the press release <a href="http://www.palmsource.com/press/2004/110104_board.html">here</a>. I love it! I was one of the first people at BeNews, the then leading news site about BeOS, and held up until we called it quits when Palm bought Be Inc.&#8217;s assets. Congratulations to Jean-Louis and congrats to PalmSource. Now I want the new OS even more :) Ok. He&#8217;s not CEO but &quot;only&quot; Chairman of the Board, but still. This is a good sign.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just found the &lt;a title=&quot;Current Electoral Vote Predictor 2004&quot; href=&quot;http://www.electoral-vote.com/&quot;&gt;Current Electoral Vote Predictor 2004&lt;/a&gt;, which is a web site telling you how the elections are likely to turn out. The site is a personal project by Andrew Tanenbaum, U.S citizen living in Holland, teaching at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, being an active Democrat Abroad, the writer of MINIX and author of five books. It&#8217;s not funded by anyone just his own money is now as of alexa.com the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;amp;url=http://www.electoral-vote.com/">top 3090 web property on the net</a>!</p>

<p>Great stuff to look at as the elections take place. The site even has a <a href="http://www.electoral-vote5.com/info/rss-info.html">RSS Feed</a>! :)</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: I put my money where my mouth is (thinking that electoral-vote.com kicks ;)) and put a few EURs on Kerry on <a href="http://www.bluevex.de/sportbets2/website/viewEventSnapshot.do;node5?id=2901871">Bluevex&#8217;s Presidential Election Bet</a>. Let&#8217;s see if I make some money :)</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t seen the Mozilla/5.0 compatible bit before. Might that be that they now track JavaScript stuff too? I heard rumors about that previously.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, I finished THE book. <a href="http://www.tompeters.com/">Tom Peters</a> new book. WOW [Period!], to use is notation. It added a lot of stuff to my quotes list. I have to admit though that the book is a little bit on the long side, and Tom keeps to repeating himself a little bit too much from time to time. But possibly this is what more settled managers need. He&#8217;s also overdoing the Talent bit. How to I come to this conclusion? Read <a href="http://www.changethis.com/6.TalentMyth">The Talent Myth</a> form Malcolm Gladwell to get an idea how Talent contributed to the downfall of Enron. There, Talent could really do anything. The ones presumed to be talented could do any mistake, loose millions. That&#8217;s overdoing the talent myth.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I fully buy the talent bit. You need to get good people and to get the truely great you will have to move beyond simply good pay. You need to have a wonderful working environment, allow for controlled mistakes, tinkering, prototypes. Just letting talent roam freely is too much.</p>

<p>He also has lots of cool examples. Wal-Mart for example had a contest internally that was not for good ideas but the &quot;stupidest thing we do around here.&quot; Great!</p>

<p>He also puts Branding very simply, and it resonates with me in terms of blogging, wiki&#8217;s, open book accounting, zero budgeting, lots of stuff. He says it&#8217;s about answering a few simple questions:
- Who are you?
- Why are you here?
- How are you unique?
- How can you make a dramatic difference?
- Who cares?</p>

<p>I love simple things. Page 160 has a brand exercise that you can try out yourself. Also great, the quote by Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead: &quot;You do not merely want to be considered the best of the best. You want to be considered the only ones who do what you do.&quot;</p>

<p>A big part of his book goes about the power of women in our economy. A great list about differences of men and women in business is on page 174 from several different sources:
- Men want to get away from authority and family. Women want to connect.
- Men are self-oriented. Women are other-oriented.
- Men are rights-oriented. Women are responsibility-oriented.
- Men have an &quot;individual perspective&quot; (The &quot;core unit is &#8216;me.&#8217;&quot;) Women have a &quot;group perspective.&quot; (The &quot;core unit is &#8216;we.&#8217;&quot;)
- Men take &quot;pride in self-reliance.&quot; Women take &quot;pride in team accomplishment.&quot;
- Vision: Men, focused. Women, peripheral
- Hearing: Women&#8217;s discomfort level is half that of men&#8217;s.
- Smell: Women, sensitive. Men, relatively insensitive.
- Touch: The most sensitive man is less sensitive to touch than the least sensitive woman.
- People orientation: By age three days, baby girls exhibit to touch than the least sensitive woman.</p>

<p>I could go on with a ton of comments from the book but it would probably get too long. It&#8217;s a great energizing read and a totally different design. It&#8217;s a great package. Go read!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Steve <a href="http://www.stevedix.de/blog/index.php?LINK=124">commented</a> (bottom) on <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/10/are_you_afraid_.html">a post of mine</a> in which I linked to a <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/10/19.html#a8431">post by Scoble</a> and he has some very valid points I&#8217;d like to extend upon.</p>

<p>First up, I don&#8217;t blog about where I work and I only blog remotely about work itself. That really allows me to blog freely about everything else, even though some of the things are related to work. Scoble is correct that you need to overcome the fear to blog, both as a person and as a corporation. That&#8217;s what this is about. Blogging helps to clear your thinking and it&#8217;s a great way to do your own &quot;Brand You&quot; campaign.</p>

<p>Companies need to get their own voice (yes, read Cluetrain Manifesto ;)) and if a company decides that blogging will help them get that voice, then they will really have to embrace blogging and the bloggers in their ranks. That&#8217;s a totally different system though. Bloggers don&#8217;t need to blog about work. It&#8217;s not like this is your duty and if the company doesn&#8217;t want bloggers that talk about the company then they don&#8217;t. Of course, linking a blogger to a company has the added risk of that blogger moving somewhere else and believing that the blogger is intelligent enough to blog freely and know the limits.</p>

<p>What Scoble&#8217;s post really is good at is showing the power of blogging and that the phenomenon has just begun. Let&#8217;s not call it blogging but personal publishing, the advent of the long tail of sharing knowledge and voice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, I just found out <a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/002597.shtml">via Heiko</a> that  <a href="http://www.bild.t-online.de/BTO/service/rss/rss.html">Bild.de has an RSS Feed now</a>! Bild.de is one of the biggest sites in germany, one of the biggest papers in Germany too and had something like 270 Million page impressions in August (<a href="http://www.ivw-online.de/ausweisung/suchen.php">See IVW Online</a>). They are big. They have stuff to loose.</p>

<p>I said it <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/01/my_yahoo_rss_be.html">again</a> and <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2003/09/rss_articles.html">again</a> and <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/07/the_rss_bandwag.html">again</a> and <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/02/rss_catching_on.html">again</a> and other people like Heiko have said it too. RSS is coming and it is coming in force. Embrace it and worry about the implications later. The implications will be there anyway, it&#8217;s just a matter of feeling them or being irrelevant.</p>
