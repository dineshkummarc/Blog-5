  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s the question <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001513.php">John asks in his recent post</a> but I think he is straying of the path a little bit in the process. He mentions, and rightly so, that all the armchair CEOs out there always know best what Google should do and say so. Sadly they don&#8217;t know a lot about what happens in Google itself and they always have vastly different opinions among themselves. So you can&#8217;t really please them. John also believes that we really long for a clear vision from a leader and that might be partly true.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To quote an old summary from a course, in the end, leadership is about acceptable influence and effective persuasion. It depends on knowledge and expertise and on developing interpersonal relationships based on mutual trust and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;What John is talking about is in large part the understanding part. We don&#8217;t really know where Google is going and as a group we need both that and a sense of why getting there is so damn important.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The other very important part that is probably bugging a lot more people at this time is the mutual trust or just trust in general. We have stopped trusting Google to do good&#8230; oh yeah right, they only said that they don&#8217;t do bad (which is amazingly different from doing good), so that is alright. The thing is that they are starting to do too much stuff that is not really nice in terms of privacy issues. It&#8217;s no wonder they pulled the accelerator again. Nobody believed their idea of doing it to allow people to save time &#8230; I think 7.5 minutes was in their image on the homepage. Who the hell cares. We are surfing fast enough, and really not accidently prefetching some illegal porn pictures.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;They are extending AdSense and AdWords to allow for big sized Flash banners. How come they don&#8217;t run on Google itself though? Oh yeah, they&#8217;re annoying.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Some things they do just seem to be ungood, not bad, but not really doing something good either. And at the same time they are making billions. We just don&#8217;t get it. The trust is starting to creep away. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;And one thing. If they are planning anything like a WebOS, then I&#8217;d pretty swiftly start talking to people about privacy issues and why you are so damn trustable because it&#8217;s a very important issue for the thing Google does.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Motivated by <a href="http://blogs.atlassian.com/rebelutionary/archives/000495.html">Atlassian&#8217;s Hackathon</a> the fine people at JotSpot performed the <a href="http://blog.jot.com/archives/2005/05/09/jotspot-inagural-hackathon/">Jotspot Inagural Hackathon</a>. The idea is for coders to work on unfamiliar turf on something that can be delivered as a prototype in a day&#8230; in one day. So at the end you have presentations and a lot of creativity that would otherwise have gone unused. Very cool indeed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My brother is back blogging, this time <a href="http://ft.typepad.com/adultweb/2005/05/googlenet_and_t.html">complaining about Google&#8217;s Web Accelerator</a>. This becomes especially important with Google&#8217;s <a href="http://www.gigaom.com/2005/05/07/google-hacked/">DNS Glitch</a>. There are also specific items as <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/07/1932224&amp;amp;from=rss">reported via Slashdot</a> that due to the prefetching system people are reporting that their data gets deleted via things like a javascript popup asking if you really want to delete something. As my brother also pointed out once, who knows what is in the prefetched first item of a search&#8230; might be something illegal which then ends up on your computer. In his recent post he really talks about some of the privacy issues that just don&#8217;t seem to take on the same force as they did in previous cases with other companies. Compared to Doubleclick, Google is huge.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As with <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2002/04/book_review_mav.html">Maverick</a>, I really like this book. It is actually a little bit more insightful and answers a lot of questions that people might have about his management style. If you didn&#8217;t know about Ricardo just yet, read my <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2002/04/book_review_mav.html">review of Maverick</a> first.</p>

<p>Now to this one. He starts the chapters with a few sentences to get you in the thinking mood. For example the first one:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;1. Why are we able to answer email on Sundays, but unable to go to the movies on Monday afternoons?
2. Why can&#8217;t we take the kids to work if we can take work home?
3. Why do we think the opposite of work is leisure, when in fact it is idleness?&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Now I will try to get you in the thinking mood a bit more by a quote about Semco from the book: &lt;I&gt;Semco has no official structure. It has no organizational chart. There&#8217;s no business plan or company strategy - no two-year or five-year plan, no goal or mission statement, no long-term budget&#8230;&lt;/I&gt; For a new employee coming in from Arthur Andersen they paid a handsome salary but did not give him a desk, or a title, or business cards.</p>

<p>I am actually at a loss in relation to summarizing this book because it needs to be read and appreciated. I will give you more to think though be quoting a few more of his introductions.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;Success and Money are Distant Relatives&lt;/B&gt;
1. Why do people have to stick to a career choice they made as an unprepared adolescent?
2. Why doesn&#8217;t money buy success if almost everyone measured their success in cash?
3. Why do billionaires greedily accumulate money, only to donate it to ethereal concepts such as world peace?</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Management By (O)mission&lt;/B&gt;
1. Why do we tell our employees that we trust them, then audit and search them when they go home?
2. Why does our customized and carefully crafted credo look like everyone else&#8217;s?
3. Why do we demand and go to war for democracy as nations, yet accept with docility that no one has the right to choose their own bossed?</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;A Long Line of Pied Pipers&lt;/B&gt;
1. Why do we have a flock mentality and follow rams that turn out to be wolves?
2. Why do we think we are equipped to choose schools, doctors and mayors, but don&#8217;t trust our capacity to lead ourselves at work?
3. Why do we continuously look for saviours and hereos to lead us?</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Rambling into the Future&lt;/b&gt;
1. Why do we think that the future &#8216;is in God&#8217;s hands&#8217; and then pre-plan every moment of it?
2. Why do we think intuition is so valuable and unique - and find no place for it as an official business instrument?
3. Why do we agree that living well is living every moment, without reinforcing parst or future - but then spend most of our work lives dealing with historical data and future budgets?&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>All this might sound weird from time to time, and you might think you have an answer (and sometimes you might even do) but the papers between these lines hold a lot of insight into how we can think differently if we just dare to do so.</p>
