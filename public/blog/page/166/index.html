  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just read an article about some Google Tips and wanted to share some of them with all of you out there, because some are really nice.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use the Google Preferences. They allow you to say that you want all search results to open in a new window and to show 20 results on one page for example. Very convenient.</p></li>
<li><p>If you send arround Google URLs, then you can use &lt;a&gt;TinyURL&lt;/a&gt; to make them shorter. Knew that one already but still good to have it standing here.</p></li>
<li><p>Google has a calculator. Just use the search bar, including brackets and everything. This was actually done by somebody who was supposed to write a language tool. I might have quoted that already here some time though.</p></li>
<li><p>They are pointing to <a href="http://www.googlealert.com">Google Alert</a> which I am already using happily.</p></li>
<li><p>They list the Google URL Parameters, something that might come in handy for parsing the URL once in a while.</p></li>
<li>&amp;: All parameters are seperated by this value</li>
<li>as_q: used between words as AND</li>
<li>num: Number of items per result page</li>
<li>hl: language of the Google page you are using</li>
<li>btnG: Text of the Search Button</li>
<li>as_epq: Search for exact match</li>
<li>as_oq: when OR is used in the search</li>
<li>as_eq: NOT</li>
<li>Ir: Only search in one language</li>
<li>as_ft: Option to include (i) or exclude (e) certain file types</li>
<li>as_filetype: only search for that filetype</li>
<li>as_qdr: only search for a specific amount of time (all, m3, y)</li>
<li>as_occt: gives the position of the search term on the page</li>
<li>as_dt: to exclude a domain</li>
<li><p>as_sitesearch: exclude or only search on one domain</p></li>
<li><p>Google Dance will soon be a thing of the past, as Google will be updating continuously, something I can confirm from a recent search engine conference. This is partly due to improvements in the indexing machanism and in the amount of pages they can index.</p></li>
<li><p>With the help of the search parameter &quot;intitle:&quot; you can search for things in the title only. There is also inurl: intext: inanchor:</p></li>
<li><p>To use hidden features try <a href="http://www.faganfinder.com/google.html">Google Ultimate Interface</a>.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Those are just a few of the tips but some nice ones.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had the exact same idea <a href="http://www.admpartners.com/archives/2003/11/000225.html">as Anil de Mello</a> in relation to using Nokia&#8217;s digital pen together with a Bluetooth/MMS Phone to blog textnotes. Actually, I am simply wondering about the power of this pen in general, because I am looking at getting the 6600 from Nokia and ditching the Palm. I might need some extra input method to be a little bit more flexible when taking notes.</p>

<p>The only problem I don&#8217;t like with this pen is that you need digital paper and you can&#8217;t do without it. So you can&#8217;t just take the pen, but you need to also take the paper with you to use it. On top of that, a problem with Anil&#8217;s idea is that you would need handwriting recognition at least for the e-mail address, which is currently not there.</p>

<p>I would be able to use the pen as a method of enhancing presentations though. Still to be found out though is whether it really only syncs with USB and not via Bluetooth with a PC, which Nokia says is how it works. Bluetooth only seems to work to a mobile phone, which sounds a bit weird.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;(comment: As originally posted on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)
This is where it gets a lot more interesting. We are looking at investment appraisal.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The time value of money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This is about compounding and discounting, meaning that money is worth less in the future and this more is also dependant on interest on interest gained. The compounding formula is the following:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;57&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;compounding.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/compounding.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;where S is the sum owing after the time t on the principal P with an interest x. If you turn the formula arround, calculating P based on S, you can find out the present value of money that you will receive in the future: the present value or the discounted value. $1 received in a year, is only worth $0.9091 in case we take an interest rate of 10%. The discount factor would for money received in a year at 10% interest would then be 0.9091.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;What about receiving payments in a regular manner. Here we need the formula for payment value of an annuity. (r = 1+x/100))&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;206&quot; height=&quot;68&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;annuity.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/annuity.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;If we want to get $1000 per year for 10 years and our interest rate is 10% then we get $6144 as the money to be put into the account at the beginning of the period. We can turn this arround to calculate annual repayment sums, for mortgages for example.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;217&quot; height=&quot;70&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;mortgage.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/mortgage.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This is also the formula where the discount factor comes from, in cases where we want to see how much money $10.000 in one year would be worth today.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;For interest rates you also need to take into account how many times they are paid per year. 10% annual rate, paid twice a year at 5% each, will give you $1 x (1,05)<sup>2</sup> = $ 1,1025, meaning that the effective interest rate is 10,25%. The power of compounding.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;It starts to get a bit more complicated as we move on to &lt;strong&gt;investment appraisal&lt;/strong&gt;, starting with net present value. Here we use the annuity formula from above. Buying a machine, you look at your cost of funds taking into account:
- interest payable per year for the money required to buy the machine
- the amount of savings you presume to get per year by getting the machine
- the amount of years it will run&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;All these savings will then have a set value today. This present value less the cost of the machine is what is called net present value (NPV). In case you get a NPV of 0, the resulting discount rate (1/r = 1 / (1+x/100)<sup>t)</sup> is called the internal rate of return (IRR) or yield.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Another item to use is the payback period, which will simply take the cash flows in each year to see when the machine is paid back. Making it a bit more complicated, you can also discount each cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Further issues in NPV are that you need to take into account relevant costs and revenues only. This is best explained through the examples present in the introduction book. In short, think about whether a cash-flow will change if you do what you do. If it does, it&#8217;s relevant, if it doesn&#8217;t, it isn&#8217;t ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Another item is reflected in the fisher equation: (1+ nominal interest rate) = (1+ real interest rate) (1+ expected inflation rate). In reality, it gets more complicated because discounting needs to take into account preference for money now, inflation and a risk premium, which is hard to pinpoint. Another impotant item is that future cash flows might lead to taxes and purchases might be able to be depreciated over time.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Profitability index is about finding out which project to do. It&#8217;s calculated by deviding the NPV by the money invested in a year. The higher the PI, the more worthwhile the project to do.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;(comment: As originally posted on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)
<a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/oubs/bin/oubs.dll?CB821">The course</a> has started. The course starts with an introduction book, something I will cover shortly here. Most of the things will be common knowledge but I will add the most important functions here for later reference.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ll start with the second chapter (Algebra, graphs and calculus). Here are some basics:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;a&lt;em&gt;0 = 0
a&lt;/em&gt;1 = a
a + b = b + a
a&lt;em&gt;b = b&lt;/em&gt;a
a&lt;em&gt;(b+c) = a&lt;/em&gt;b + a&lt;em&gt;c
a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c
a&lt;/em&gt;(b&lt;em&gt;c) = (a&lt;/em&gt;b)*c&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Moving on to solving equations, one thing can be said: whatever you do on one side of an equation, you do on the other too (like adding 2 or multiplying x), then you are just fine. You should also take the unknown to one side of the equation. All in all, always follow that system. Multiply, add, substract, remove brackets, whatever, just get the unknown on one side so that the result is something like X = 2. It might takesome time but you&#8217;ll get there. If you have two variables, just take one of them on one side and the other on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Next on our list are logarithms. For me, these buggers are hard to wrap my head arround. Somehow, x*y seems fully natural but log(x) doesn&#8217;t, while it should. So here are some rules:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Log (xy) = Log x + Log y
Log (x/y) = Log x - Log y
Log (x<sup>n)</sup> = n Log x
Log (x<sup>(1/n))</sup> = (1/n) Log x
Log (x<sup>-n)</sup> = -n Log x&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The same can be done for natural logarithms, which are written &quot;ln&quot; and are in relation to powers based on &quot;e&quot;. Never mind what it all means, just that &quot;e&quot; is, as weird as it sounds, a very special number that will come up in lots of cases.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Next the book looks at graphs and how to find the function behind them. In general, the folloing terms are useful:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Rise / Run = y height climed / x distance travelled = change in y value / change in x value = slope. This is probably more interesting to somebody without english as his native language, like me ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Now this slope brings us to the first derivative though, because the first derivative is the slope of a graph. In a sense it is:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Change in y / Change in x&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;When we go into minute changes in both x and y, then we are doing a differentiation. Here we need some rules which I still remember all too well from physics studies.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;dy/dx = na x<sup>(n-1)</sup> is the differentiation of y = ax<sup>n&lt;/p&gt;</sup></p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Implied in this is that you will have a low or highpoint in a graph if the differentiation is 0. A high point would be present if the second derivative is negative (the y values going down with increasing x values after the point), a lot point if it is positive (y going up). Remember that you can also do partial differentiation, meaning that you differentiate only for one variable.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statistical techniques&lt;/strong&gt; is next. Everything starts with averages and here you have three:
- The arithmetic mean, being the sum of all values devided by the number of values. That the average evryone knows.
- The mode is the data that occurs most frequently
- The median is the middle data, when all data is arranged in order of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You can calculate all three with Excel or other spreadsheets. Another mean is the geometric mean which is calculated my multiplying the different values and taking the nth root of the product. This is used when there is some kind of compounding in the data series.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Another important item in statistics is teh range = x(max) - x(min). It will help us find the spread of data arround the middle. Here the standard deviation is useful.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;238&quot; height=&quot;72&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;standard_deviation.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/standard_deviation.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The variance is the square of the standard deviation (V = S<sup>2)&lt;/p&gt;</sup></p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Next up is the normal distribution, which is kind of the shape of the data or graph in question. The normal distribution is the typical bell shape. For any normal distribution there are a few facts:
- 68.26% of readings occure within +/- 1S
- 95.45% within +/- 2S
- 99.74% within +/- 3S&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In general, a sample of n&gt;30 will suffice to use standard deviation. The sample mean will possibly be a number of standard errors arround the true population mean, but due to being normally distributed, 95% will be within +/- 1.96 SE and 99% within +/- 2.58 SE, where SE = (population standard deviation) / (route of sample size). Therefore, if we want to find the range of true means within the population with a 99% certainty, then we need to calculate the sample size mean +/- 1,96SE.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;153&quot; height=&quot;70&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;sample_to_population.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/sample_to_population.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Next up, &lt;strong&gt;correlation and covariance&lt;/strong&gt;. We can have positive or negative correlation in relation to whether one variable reacts the same way or adverse to another variable. Correlation analysis is done to find links between different sets of data. A first thing to do this is to draw a scatter diagram, simply putting all your data points into a chart and then seeing if they have something in common. The correlation formula is the following:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;<a href="http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/correlation.jpg">&lt;img width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;60&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;correlation.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/correlation-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;</a>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Regression analysis is used to find a relationship between two sets of data. If you estimate within your range of data you are doing an interpolation, where an extrapolation would be about making estimates for values outside your observed range.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In general, you will find the following:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;274&quot; height=&quot;135&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;linear_regression_analysis.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/linear_regression_analysis.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This part of the book finishes off with time series analysis. Here you take, for example, your quarterly data, add 4 quarters up, device them by 4 and you get your 4-quarter moving average. Averaging two 4-quarter moving averages will give you the centered 4-quarter moving average, allowing you to compare this average with the real value, giving you seasonal variation. Then you can forecast sales and take into account seasonable variations.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two days ago I <a href="http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000984.php">posted</a> about six girls having launched an <a href="http://cgi.ebay.de/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;amp;item=2961465280">auction on ebay</a> where they give themselves away (plus some beer) for a party. By now, they are run over by the press, can&#8217;t reply to the flood of e-mail anymore, have brought their hosting provider down, got a new one, and have the auction standing at over 12000 EUR!!! They didn&#8217;t expect this to happen naturally but it once again shows the power of viral marketing if you want. Create something like this with a brand attached and you got it going. It&#8217;s be interesting to see what comes of this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some time ago, I linked to the <a href="http://www.ennead.de/blog/archives/000863.php">RSS Primer</a>, a guide for publishers to RSS. This same guide is now linked by Amy Gahran from her <a href="http://blog.contentious.com/">Contentious Blog</a>. You can find it in her article entitled <a href="http://blog.contentious.com/archives/000038.html">What is RSS, and why should I care?</a>. This is a very good introduction for all those who don&#8217;t know what good it will do for them, as a user.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With the start of my financial strategy course I need to find out how to add formulas to my HTML code in <a href="http://www.ennead.de/ou/">this blog</a>. This will turn out to be interesting &#8230; and lots to read. I actually thought MathML would be a good solution but after <a href="http://tech.irt.org/articles/js208/index.htm">this article</a> I am not to sure anymore and <a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/math/">this article</a> talks about some other forms including the use of CSS. All in all, using simple images seems more and more clever, even though I do not want to use a million images and I actually want to indexed. So please, if anyone has a simple solution, I am all ears. In the meantime, <a href="http://www.unics.uni-hannover.de/nhtcapri/mathematics.html">this is pretty nice</a> even if it gets really scary if you look at the source code ;)</p>
