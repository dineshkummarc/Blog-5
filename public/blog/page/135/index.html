  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Finance can be seen similar to a chain of command, just that it is a circle with the front line worker in the end providing the funding through pensions or life insurance. How corporations are run is very important in this entire system and with agency theory alreaddy hinting at the problems to link shareholder and management interest, corporate governance has increased in importance.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Market-based systems are one form of corporate governance and it&#8217;s a set of systems and strucutres, the &quot;rules of the game&quot; for top managers, set by the board of directors and showing what stakeholders can expect in how the corporation will be run.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In the USA, ownership and control is generally seperated but arguments have since started with Jensen and Mockling (1970) that this seperation means CEOs will not always maximise shareholder value. In the 1990s option schemes rose to more aling shareholders and managemnt. Now shareholders rebelled as underwater options weren&#8217;t converted.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Who ownes the companies? In the USA 60% of all shares are held by institutions (pension, mutual, insurance funds, &#8230;). In the UK that&#8217;s 66%. They control hundreds of billions of dollars worldwide. Their control is limited by a legal need to diversify (UK) and by the Glass Steagall Act (US). With 60 or more firms in their portfolio, they do not have the time, and do not see the need, to closely watch senior management, rather keeping their independetness.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Many investing institutions even give proxy votes to management making it unlikely that any (even organised) vote against management comes through.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Systems for corporate governance could be:
- alignment of management remmuneration to shareholder interest
- board seats to independent non-executive directors representing shareholders
- the market for corporate control, as it is known, simply meaning that shareholders can sell their shares, forcing the stock price down, allowing for a hostile take over
- creditors have high influence
- change of financial statute for realignement&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Increasing gearing meant that the bankrupty risk increased and management has to manage the cash flow more efficiently. This is a new form of LBO (leveraged buyout) if you want.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;MBOs are often used when parts of the company are underperforming due to competition on funds and subsidisation of other parts of the company. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Relationship based systems are more used in Germany, Japan and France. Here the shareholding is less diffuse with large chunks being owned by corporates or banks. Relationships with these large shareholders are long-term and may or may not be formal like via supervisary boards over the board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Monitoring is the main form here and linking executive pay to the shre price is rare, as are hostile takeovers or mergers. There are even restrictions on voting rights underlying shares limiting them to not allow for control, no matter what the number of shares. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Partly due to the funding needs market-based systems are increasing and shareholder value is starting to replace stakeholder value even though this change is slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Internal v. external reporting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Internal (management accounting): planning, decision-making, control, often performance is measured.
External (financial accounting): decision making, stewardship, accountability, each stakeholder needs different numbers but the main one in the Anglo-Saxon model is the shareholder anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Financial reports did not aling managers with adding value for shareholders and this has led to linking pay to shareprice via options or shareperformance in relation to an index or other sahre measures. This has lead to senior managers being valued based on economic value-based measured while other managers are  measured on accounting-based measures.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Dillon and Owers (1997) argued that measurement metrics within a management control system need to be:
- consistent with corporate objectives
- perceived to be fair
- variables must be SMART
- inform management when to take action&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Divisional busdget targets are normally set artificially low by the respective managers, to easily meet their targets and this is not inline with senior management objectives to increase revenue per share or economic value.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Leveraged buy-outs targetted firms with apparent low earnings (high P/E) but high cash flows (low P/CF). EV/EBITDA is another value that is often used. DCF brought in the importance of Cost-of-Capital for a firm&#8217;s value, which LBOs knew. They reduced WACC to improve operations, kind of.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;All this, including dramatic changes in share value not reflected in P/E values drove a rethinking towards cash flow and the importance of WACC. Efficient use of capital resources grew more important than growth for growth&#8217;s sake.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Economic and accounting measures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;An external market for corporate control can be most efficient but there is still an attempt to have internal systems. They are related to shareholder value and they look at returns only after those expected by investors. They are based on the concept of economic income, which is the generated income net of investors&#8217; ROCI. Economic income started as a concept in the 1930s (Peinreich, 1938):&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Accounting profit = NOPAT = C&lt;em&gt;t (A&lt;/em&gt;t - A_t-1)
where C= cash paid out to owners (all providers of capital)
A = accounting book value&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Economic income = residual income = E&lt;em&gt;t = NOPAT&lt;/em&gt;t - WACC x A_t-1&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This means you show the return after having given all owners the return they wanted for taking the risk of investment in the beginning of the period. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;After that, the value of the company is: V&lt;em&gt;t = SUM ( C&lt;/em&gt;t+n / (1+WACC)<sup>n</sup> )&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;V&lt;em&gt;t = A&lt;/em&gt;t + SUM (E_t+n /(1+WACC)<sup>n</sup> )&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;While the first one is cash flow based, the second one is based on economic value added, but they should give the same values. This is actually similar to NPV in that it looks at the excess return.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;It does require comprehensive income and clean surplus accounting principles though, which are not required at this time. This means that there might need to be 164 changes to the asset values in your books. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In response UK accounting regulators have introduced the Statement of Total Reconised Gains and Losses (STRGL, struggle) working in a clean surplus profit for shareholders method.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The ISB is also encouraging a move to economic vlaue and might require balance sheet items to be quoted in value in use, which requires a DCF method.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Economic income is actually the same as economic value added (EVA), a term trademarked by Stern Steward. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;EVA&lt;em&gt;t = NOPAT&lt;/em&gt;t - WACC x A&lt;em&gt;t-1 = (ROCE&lt;/em&gt;t - WACC) x A_t-1
(As ROCE = NOPAT/A)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;They do argue that due to the already quoted V&lt;em&gt;t calculation, a positive EVA will lead to a higher V&lt;/em&gt;t. And the last formula tell a company to work on activities that earn a ROCE above WACC and to minimise the WACC. The nice thing is that this is relatively easy to understand and this measure can be used both for internal managers as well as shareholders or top management.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Economic income in internal reporting&lt;/i&gt; are gaining popularity (EVA, SVA), but more so in the US than in the UK. They do mostly still use budgets, target profit, target cash flow, value drivers or balanced scorecard. Only 10% use EVA and 15% SVA. In the US, NPV, ROIC, CFROI (real IRR of the investment) or EVA are important. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The problem with NPV is that it is purely a cash flow measure and this is not so readily available in standard management accounting systems. But it is still used a lot for projects.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;ROIC is calculated via NOPAT (adjusted as if there was no debt) and the opening or average capital by long term investors.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;CFROA is both about the future as well as the present and past, but again a cash flow measure and it is inflation adjusted for easier comparison. It has to be compared to cost of capital in real terms and can be used as a means of valueing companies. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;EVA is a money amount and no ratio. It also looks at NOPAT and removes a charge for WACCxAssets. The last three are really saying the same thing in the end. The disadvantage for EVA is that it is not easy to compare companies as it is an accounting measure and Stern Steward said that there are up to 164 accounting adjustments needed to be made to book values to reflect current value of invested capital.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are three main adjustments:
- goodwill that has been written off needed to be added back to invested capital and if deducted from profits added back to NOPAT. Companies that are bought need to earn about WACC on their true book value.
- R&amp;D expenditure needs to be treated as an asset and hence needs to be added back to NOPAT and included in invested capital.
- Leases are part of invested capital as they are seen as debt finance. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Another disadvantage is that EVA is difficult to implement at the divisional level especially as it is very hard to apportion the invested capital of the company. But this is true for every divisional performance measure. Transfer pricing doesn&#8217;t make things easier. The problem is though that profits do not necessarily add value in terms of EVA.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The last problem is actually applied to value-based metrics in general, is that there is a lot of things like intellectual property, knowledge, IT systems, that aren&#8217;t fully reflected in the books. It only shows up as goodwill when an acquisition has happened. How do you value employees would be another question.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;On top of that, how do you value social interests in corporate performance? Nobody has found any measures in this space though. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There is also ongoing concern about which measures to use in the public sector. Historically government spending has been monitored on a cash accounting basis. The problem there is that there is no difference made between one-off spendings and spendings on assets that generate future revenue. There is also no incentive to dispose of loss making assets. Government now turned to accruals accounting. This accounting method is introduced in the UK as resource accounting including: operating statement, balance sheet, cash-flow statement, a main objective analysis, output and performance analysis. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;All in all, things are changing from monitoring of inputs to those of outputs, and linking executive pay to it. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Public-Sector Financial Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Here things are driving by the VFM, the value for money. This can be linked to the three E&#8217;s (Economy, Efficiency, Effectiveness) and goes back to the fifth century BC (Dewar, 1989) and has grown in importance in the last two decades. In a move to control spending and improve resource allocation and accountability, there is now a drive towards more private like accounting methods. Now there is some confusion in relation VFM, mostly as there are different objectives, methodologies and standards. It moved from confronting managers about problems, to more checking of management&#8217;s account of achieving VFM targets. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are several approaches and some can be suggested here (based on Bowerman, 1996):
- Review of management systems, arrangements and procedures (how can value for money be improved)
- Value for money procedures audit (are there objectives and are they checked)
- Policy audit (Are the three E&#8217;s matched)
- Audit of management represenations of value for money (Is presented information correct)
- comparative performance audit
- Quality audit (e.g. customer satisfaction surveys)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Best value is a new approach, mixing audit and what should be done, including quality. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Performance Measurement and Investment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;How are investors subject to performance measures is the question of this part. Institutional investors are very important, especially where funds are used for savings in relation to people&#8217;s pensions. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In measurement of trustee performance it is important that the trustee represents those that gave their trust, and in terms of for example pension funds, this means that they need to be able to pay out the promised pensions, known as the minimum funding requirement. Above and beyond that, they should maximise the returns over the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;These trustees do not need to know anything about investments, as they delegate that part of internal or external fund management. External fund management companies are growing strong and their managers make presenations to the trustees. They do need to maximise return but reduce risk through diversification. They need to report quarterly which might even make them perform less optimally in relation to their goal. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;These funds also use the matching principle, meaning that they will try to match their investments with their required payouts. The fund managers that run these funds will try to stick close to the median of all pension fund managers as they are normally measured in relation to other fund managers and only need to be top of the list. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The problem is that these investments sometimes don&#8217;t follow CAPM, which would predict that with no prior expectation, investments should mirror market size internationally. But should trustees follow the herd and invest where CAPM predicts of where the average UK fund manager invests. If they take the CAPM approach, they might end up in the bottom band of UK fund management companies. This would be a breach of their contract to optimize performance. But without it they didn&#8217;t take advantage of USA stock rises as best they could, which they would have with CAPM.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Also, some pension funds add an ethical bit to the mix, excluding for example tabacco companies. This also can cause underperformance.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So how should the fund managers be measured. They will have to outperform and this can be done through better asset allocation than the median or a better stock selection than the benchmark. In the past they didn&#8217;t do well in asset allocation in general, not predicting US stock rise and being over-optimistic on Japan. Managers do believe that markets are not efficient at one level because they do believe that they can consistently outperform via their stock picks. With a higher return, they normally also have a higher tracking error (standard deviation on top of comparison index)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Many trustees are switching to passive funds.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

I do still think that this will be big, the  blogging thing, even though it will loose a bit of its hype. The bigger thing might be that this is actually what might bring back the trust to corporations, which I have been trying to touch upon a little bit recently. The Cluetrain Manifesto was already talking about the voice that corporations need on the web, and this is starting to fall in place actually.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fred <a href="http://www.com-soft.de/mt/archives/000242.html">pointed me</a> to an <a href="http://www.worthwhilemag.com/entry/2004/04/07/global_positioning.php">article on Worthwhile</a>, talking about globalisation and adding in a little bit about responsibility. This is really something that needs a lot more thinking on my part, and I had some discussions about it in my holiday. The thing is that all this efficiency bit, all this focus on numbers, leads to people being let go, for efficiency&#8217;s sake. This is not a bad thing in itself, because many companies will not be able to survive if they don&#8217;t work on their efficiency, effectiveness and economy. And it might be argued that other jobs will be created, but the question is if there will be another job created for a factory worker that this factory worker can do. Also, are we really creating value this way? I am currently looking at the Economic Value Added method of finding out if a company is adding value, but what if we would take into account something like average buying power (not salary) of the employees and money spent by countries for people that are out of the job while having worked at that company?</p>

<p>The Siemens CEO von Pierer might actually not be the best example on somebody doing good. Yes, they did probably add EVA and shareholder value, but <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2003/09/scary_thoughts.html">here</a> (german, sorry) is a good text about what would happen if Pierer would be leading Germany not Siemens.</p>

<p>All this stuff is highly complicated and I am starting to feel more and more that there needs to be a new way of doing business. There needs to be more responsibility, there needs to be <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/04/its_about_trust.html">trust in business</a>. Dee Hock comes to mind again and again, as is Ricardo Semler and I will have to read Thomas Malone&#8217;s book on The Future of Work, based on <a href="http://www.typepad.com/t/trackback/643847">Loic&#8217;s suggestion of the book</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Contingency risk means that the risk is linked to a certain trigger. Options do fit here, as you could sell the option to give something in case something else happens. Financial options are also linked to an underlying transaction that triggers changes in the option value, which is why options and futures are called derivatives.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Options&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Options as financial instruments, allow for contingent risk to be traded. They started in 1973 when the Chicago Board Options Exchange was born. 1977 put options (the right to sell a security) were introduced. Within 10 years the value of options traded exceeded that of the underlying shares. Then more underlying were added and more financial centers. There are four main types of options: on shares, on interest rates, on currencies and on commodities. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A call options allows you to buy x shares at price y at date z. A put option allows you to sell x shares at price y at date z. American options can be exercised on or before expiry and european options on the expiry date.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Quotations telll you for example:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;C&amp;W    460    Jan/50
this would mean that for 500 pounds, you can buy an options for 1000 C&amp;W shares for a price of 460p up till the third wednesday in January. If at that time, or before, the C&amp;W share price is at 510p a share, then buying them for 460p will give you a profit of 50px1000= 500 pounds, meaning that you came out even. Above that price you made a profit.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There is always a buyer and a seller/writer wiith options. Writers could be pension funds or asset management companies that want to hedge. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A call option with the exercise price below the current share price is called in the money, with the money gained being the intrinsic value. With the EP below the share price, it is called out of the money. With EP=SP it is called at the money. If the option price is above the intrinsic value of the option, this difference is called the time value, meaning what one would pay because of belief that the shares could rise. With the time to expiry shrinking, time value also shrinks.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;As options give you the right but no obligation to excercise that very option, the loss is limited to the price of the option, making them important for portfolio insurance and guaranteed funds. If the share price goes up, then the % return is much greater with options than with the underlying. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analysing Options&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Writing call options is extremely risky as the potential for losses are unlimited. This changes when the writer own the shares on which the call is written (a covered call in relation to a naked call). Page 15 of the book includes a few nice pay-off diagrams that are normally used when looking at option returns. If you start looking at these charts you can imagine that almost everything is possible with mixing different kinds of options. When looking at a portfolio of options, the best way to draw a pay-off diagram is by first using a table with values for the different options at different share prices, allowing your to find the sum of their values and to draw the pay-off diagram.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;When writing a covered call, the only downside is loosing the share when the option is excercised, otherwise, there will be a profit because the share pay-off will run contra the option pay-off when the share price rises.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Call option prices decrease as exercise price increases and the other way arround. All this flexibility might allow for arbitrage, risk-free profits with options through differences in pricing on the same product. Due to liquid markets, any such situations are traded away swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are several propositions in relation to options:
1. Share Price &gt;= Call Price &gt;= max (0, Share - excercise price)
2. Price of a call option increases as the time to expiry increases
3. Price of call options decrease as they exercise price increases
4. Value of American call options = value of European call option
5. Put = Call - Share price + PV(exercise price)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Option valuation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;1973 Fischer Black and Myron Scholes introduced a new model to value options and it only needed readily observable values. The Black-Scholes model has since retained its position as the most popular option valuation tool. Another method is the binominal method by Cox, Ross and Rubinstein (1979), which might be simpler to understand, is more flexible but is very difficult to compute. The Black-Scholes formula looks difficult but is easy to use within spreadsheets. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are different variables in the formula that have an effect on option prices:
1. Current Share Price - Excercise Price
2. Volatility is good, as we just let it expire if it is down, but higher volatility makes it more likely to be high
3. time to expiry means that when the time increases, the price increases too
4. the risk-free interest rate, included for the time value, the higher this is, the higher the option value&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The underlying idea is that you can always reproduce an option performance with a portfolio of the underlying shares and cash. The thing you can argue about though is number 2, being volatility, which is talking about the future until expiry, but is measured with a past value, something that can be different dependent on how you look at it. So you can also look at the market value at the moment and then work out the volatility that was used to calculate the market value by the market maker.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Currency options are frequently used in treasury management. Graman and Kohlhagen (1983) developed an adapted Black-Scholes for currency options. There is an important difference between options and forwards, because options are only the right to do something but forwards are a contract, meaning that you will have to e.g. exchange money at the time the contract states. Options are good because they limit downside risk, without taking away upside potential and can be used when you are not even shure if a cash flow will occur. Sometimes they also do not require daily margins as the forward market does. The rise of OTC currency options gave rise to a market for traded options. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk and Policy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This is more about a financial risk management rather than general risk, but again, risk mapping can be helpful. In general, the methods used need to fit the market and business as well as the size of a company. Not everybody needs or can finance a treasury function for example. You should actually take a look at the entire organisation and beyond financial risks.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Ok. Got me there. Thanks to <a href="http://www.taospace.com">Thijs</a>&#8217;s post about <a href="http://blog.taospace.com/2004/04/what_google_is_.html">What Google is up to</a>, I now had a very fascinating read again. You should probably start with <a href="http://blog.topix.net/archives/000011.html">this blog post</a> about how Google stores the Web (several times) in RAM, at least potentially. I am not 100% sold on that one yet, but it&#8217;s at least an idea and it is really possible, especially considering something like the new MySQL Cluster and personal experience doing this for a statistics engine. The more interesting one though is <a href="http://blog.topix.net/archives/000016.html">this article</a>. Here are a few parts: &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Google has taken the last 10 years of systems software research out of university labs, and built their own proprietary, production quality system. What is this platform that Google is building? It&#8217;s a distributed computing platform that can manage web-scale datasets on 100,000 node server clusters. It includes a petabyte, distributed, fault tolerant filesystem, distributed RPC code, probably network shared memory and process migration. And a datacenter management system which lets a handful of ops engineers effectively run 100,000 servers. Any of these projects could be the sole focus of a startup.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Or&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&#8217;m a sucker for cool OS research. Browsing papers from Google employees about distributed systems, thread migration, network shared memory, GFS, makes me feel like a kid in Tomorrowland wondering when we&#8217;re going to Mars. Wouldn&#8217;t it be great, as an engineer, to have production versions of all this great research.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Google engineers do! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Oh boy. I wondered if they weren&#8217;t afraid that AdSense gets killed. They aren&#8217;t. This is just a stage.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: The discussion is raging about this one. Tim O&#8217;Reilly posted about Gmail <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4707">here</a> and Jeremy Zawodny went into a rage post, saying that all this isn&#8217;t really that exciting, right <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001886.html">here</a>.  Just to complete the picture on GMail a little bit ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Damn this fits in so many ways. I am slowly starting to warm up to <a href="http://a9.com/">A9</a>, Amazon&#8217;s new search engine, which I would actually call ReSearch Engine. This is not the thing you use for everyday searches really. I would still prefer Google as the results are a bit clearer it seems. But just imagine doing some research on a given subject. A <a href="http://a9.com/Capital%20Asset%20Pricing%20Model">search for Capital Asset Pricing Model</a> will also give you some book results for example. This might be very helpful. You can also look at the information Amazon has about sites via Alexa, which is also nice. And as a nice word play, ReSearch Engine is not only about research, but also about ReSearch, searching again, as Amazon logs your searches. Nice again. And yes, they know what I search for and can use that to suggest books. But hey, I will just not do all my porn searches on there then ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Foreign exchange (FX, forex) risk is the risk of a change in value due to variation in exchange rates be it resulting in a cash flow or recorded value difference. There are several exposures possible:
- transaction exposure comes from cash flow changes in relation to contractual obligations.
- translation exposure (aka accounting exposure) comes from translations of foreign accounts into home currency for a group account
- economic exposure (aka operating, strategy exposure) comes from changes in exchange rates having an effect on sales and/or costs and hence company value. Nokia had a growth in sold phones for example but not a very good growth in sales, if any, due to the decline of the USD.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Transaction exposure&lt;/b&gt; can be in both product price, invoice and realised profit or loss at conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You create a product -&gt; build stocks -&gt; fix the foreign price [potential transaction exposure] -&gt; receive order -&gt; Invoice [actual transaction exposure] -&gt; receive foreign funds -&gt; exchange into local currency [gain or loss due to exchange rate movements]&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translation exposure&lt;/b&gt; arrises from assets and liabilities available in more than one currency. It is an account concept and results in adjustments to the balance sheet reserves of the parent company. In most countries there is an account standard abou which exchange rates to take in your books and in general you should stick to the true and fair idea, meaning that you shouldn&#8217;t change the way you pick exchange rates without a real reason.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Economic exposure&lt;/b&gt; is very wide and far ranging, direct or indirect. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To measure your foreign exchange exposure you can for example use spreadsheets including the revenues and costs over several months into the future and the potential changes in linked exchange rates. Economic exposure is harder to pin down, as it can be made up of quantifiable data and less precise information. A strategic DCF model and/or scenario analysis with the help of e.g. Porter&#8217;s five forces would help here. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market for foreign exchange&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The forex market is very complicated but the book will not try to make a forex trader but to be able to understand one. The market is a framework for buying and selling currencies, with this being possible in many markets world-wide, allowing for around the clock trading. There are two markets, namely the interbank (wholesale) and the client (retail) market. A major market for any currency is the home market and international interbank markets are only found in London, New York and Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In Aprial 1998 the estimated net turnover in the global forex market wsa USD1,490 billion per working day. In relation to that, the International Monetary Fund released numbers for 1994 statingthat the total volume of goods sold world wide was USD4,314.9 billion. 58% of all forex trading happens in London, New York and Tokyo. 83% of the trading in London was interbank.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A speculator&#8217;s purpose is to take risks on market prices for profit while an arbitrageur is trying to optian risk free profits due to price differences in different markets. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The mechanics of foreign exchange&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;When currencies are bought or sold for immediate delivery (settlement in two working days) they are called spot (exchange) rates. There are two prices, one for buying and one for selling. The direct quote gives you the amount of local currency to buy one unit of foreign currency. In New York, it would be quoted as EUR1 = USD0,9055. The indirect quote gives you the number of units of foreign currency bought with one unit of home currency, e.g. USD1 = EUR1,1523&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The spread between the rates for buying and selling currency (bid and offer spread) represents the dealer&#8217;s margin. The foreign exchange dealer is the market maker and posting the rates, while the market user takes the rates as given. Bid price is the rate at which the bank buys and the offer rate at which it sells. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;When there isn&#8217;t liquid market from one currency to another, it might be worthwhile to look at cross rates, meaning that you exchange not directly but via another currency like the USD. You can use simple math to get the next exchange rate. e.g.: EUR/USD * USD/GBP = EUR/GBP. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Another thing are forward exchange contracts, an agreement to deliver a specified amount of one currency for a specified amount of another currency at some future date. This is a forward (exchange) rate. This agreement is binding. If a currency is trading at a discount, the currency is weaker in the forward market, otherwise it would be trading at a premium. Forward rates are either quoted forward outright rate or forward margin: forward outright = Spot + Forward margin&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;All transactiona are booked at the start of the deal, but the settlement of a forward deal is done at the end of the period, but to a price that has been locked in and booked at the beginning. This brings us to an interesthing concept: interest rate parity. This means that the forward rate will reflect the different in interest rates in the two currencies.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Forward Margin (FM) = [(Period in days) * (Spot rate) * (Foreign currency interest - Local currency interest)] / [360 + {Period in days x Local currency interest}]&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This 360 days is just an old habit.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Remember that risk-free gains normally do not arise as arbitrageurs will put them back inline swiftly. There is also risk attached to forwards, e.g. due to the potential default (credit risk) of one of the parties during the deal, meaning you will have to do a new deal to replace the old one. Or the settlement risk when you hold your side but the other party doesn&#8217;t pay their share. To get arround this risk, banks will reduce your borrowing limit by 5-15% of the forward value. Remember: banks do not charge fees but make their money through the bid-offer spread.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Here are some advantages in relation to forwards:
- fix currency prices
- eliminate risk
- colculate exact domestic currency value&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Premium of the foreign currency means:
- corrency string in foreign market
- exporter will receive more of his local currency in the future
- importer will pay more&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In case of a discount
- currency weaker in foreign market
- exporter will receive less local currency
- importer will pay less local currency. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The decision is led by the policy towards risk. Also, if you calculate the forward rate, and believe that the real rate at the time will be different, then there is a reason to go for such a deal. If you are in a high turnover business, with a small net margin, there is also a good reason to take out a forward cover since your margin might become negative by fluctuations in exchange rates alone. I remember one company with a very low margin business where the finance department actually made a good profit for the books due to good exploitation of the financial markets and hedging.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forecasting foreign exchange rates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Unless you want to hedge all your currency exposure, you need to think about how to decide when to do it. There are four concepts that are said to explain international exchange rates, forming the four-way equivalence model together.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;purchasing power parity&lt;/i&gt; (PPP) is based on the idea that something should cost the same everywhere. Higher inflation will lead to adjustments in the exchange rates so that things cost the same again. In the short term, there are too many market imperfections for PPP to hold, but it does seem to work for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;fisher effect&lt;/i&gt; can be put into a formula:
1 + Nominal rate = (1+Real rate)(1+Expected inflation rate)
The real rates are thought to be the same worldwide, meaning that differences in nominal rates have to come from differences in the expected inflation rate.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The fisher effect together with PPP makes up the International Fisher effect, saying that interest rate differentials will be reflected in forward exchange rates. This means that on top of a devaluaton of the home currency in case of higher inflation, there will also be an increase in home interest rate relative to the foreign market.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;interest rate parity theory&lt;/i&gt; (IRP) is about the idea that the difference between interest rates should be equal to the difference between forward and spot rates of exchange. The arbitrage relationship is key to this parity condition.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Expectations theory&lt;/i&gt; is linked to the EMH, meaning all relevant information is reflected in market rates. So the forward rate of exchange reflects what the spot rate in the future will be. All these four theories together give the four-way equivalence model, meaning that they all come to the same conclusion. (Forward - Spot rates = interest rates difference)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There is actually a Big Mac index, linked to PPP, which actually allows some prediction on future movements. Yes, that&#8217;s the price of Big Macs in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To forecast future exchange rates, some look at movements in a country&#8217;s capital account (movements in financial investments) and current account (movements of import and export). e.g. if the current account goes into a deficit, there will be a bigger demand for foreign currency to pay for those imports and that will put pressure on the exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The monetarist approach is about looking at the money supply. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Technical analysis is rather about a long term study of the market over time, with the chartists using graphics of prices and trading volumes. They believe the market takes long to reflect new information, while fundamental analysts state that the EMH would not allow for such a thing to take place. The EMH might not hold on the currency markets though as some countries might support a set currency over the long term. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;If you have different estimates you can combine them in currency histograms, weighting them by their perceived reliability. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forex risk management within the organisation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This depends on how risk averse you are.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Very -&gt; Finance in local currency or hedge
Less -&gt; Potential loss and gain is believed to be minimal or to cancel each other out
Assymetrical -&gt; hedge when interest costs preferable to exchange losses
Aggressive Speculator -&gt; exchange as potential for profit&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Multi-divisional organisations needs to decide on (de)centralisation. Departments need to decide on their exposure to currency risks in relation to foreign production or invoicing in foreign currency or how to make capital available. You choice will be between the foreward rate achieved through hedging and the forecast that exists now. The currency hedging for your company depends on the type of business and the size and makeup of the corporation. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Techniques for exposure management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure netting: Two companies in the same group net off the currency accounts that they owe to each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matching: Similar to netting just that here you are matching receipts and payments in a sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pricing adjustments: You adjust prices to match revenue and costs, establishing them in one currency only. Then of course you have exposure in your profits if you use the foreign currency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Transfer pricing within a company can of course be set fairly liberaly. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchange risk guarantees: If there is a benefit for exporting then government might give guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term borrowing in foreign currencies: Mainly used for reducing economic exposure. you simply finance in USD if your fixed asset are in the US. You also limit transaction exposure for the loan if sales are in the local market. Swaps have a potential here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial instruments: trading in spot, forwards, futures or options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Credit risk and settlement risk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;They are normally lumped together as trade risk. The come from the same route and have a low probability but danger of total loss. You need a cash management system takes care that the security of your cash is protected and it is not lying around more than needed. Most problems of loosing money inside a company are inadvertent mistakes rather than deliberate fraud. Banks record phone calls not due to mistrust but for security and to easily settle disputes. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Trade creditors are normally ranked along with other unsecured creditors. Normally we expect to be paid normally. As current liability creditors we should look at our customer&#8217;s current assets as they are our source of payments. You can also request a credit report, which should not be seen as a substiture for your own analysis. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Letters of credit allow for reduction of credit risk by interposing one or more banks between the transactions. They are sometimes called documentary credits and there are lots of variants. There are some choices you need to make. Should it be revocable (cancelable before products shipped) or irrevocable. Does the LC remove the recepient from going directly to the customer? LCs can be confirmed (guarantee of both issuing country bank and local one) or advised. It is also most common for the supplier to fund the shipping period and then be paid. Sometimes LCs are used instead of allowing credits. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A letter of guarantee is about a bank guaranteeing a certain amount in relation to certain events.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
