  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago Google opened <a href="http://froogle.de/">Froogle Germany</a> which is a nice thing but I didn&#8217;t think it was worth blogging. But now <a href="http://www.froogle.com/">Froogle</a> got back into my search lights due to <a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/11/im-wishing.html">this Google Blog post</a>. In it Jason Shellen announces something that was creatively swiped from Amazon, something I have been using there for ages. A wish list. Yes, at least in the US version, not yet in the German one, you can now add everything you find to your wish list. <a href="http://froogle.google.com/shoppinglist/shoppinglist?action=ShowWishList&amp;amp;email=mysecretsanta@gmail.com">here</a> is an example list. Perfect timing and I now want it in German too please!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just wrote <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/11/your_job_blog.html">a post</a> about using your blog to get a job and now Jeremy C. Wright goes to the extreme there in putting up <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;amp;item=5142129647">an eBay auction</a> where you can kind of hire his bloging talent. That he has talent is known by now and the offer is interesting. If you are a company that has been thinking about all this bloging stuff and don&#8217;t know how to attack the space, this is something for you. How do you blog? Which system do you use? What&#8217;s a trackback? How do I allow my people to blog? Aren&#8217;t there risks? What should I allow? Will this new voice kill me? Isn&#8217;t it a fad? What will it add to my bottom line? These are just some of the questions Jeremy could help at. Above and beyond that he could get your started bloging.</p>

<p>And if all that is not enough, it&#8217;s a very cool idea and as Jeremy says in <a href="http://www.ensight.org/archives/2004/11/23/ebay-blogger-for-hire-auction/">this post</a> you don&#8217;t know if there is a market for it if you didn&#8217;t try. That&#8217;s the cool thing about this internet thingy. You can try stuff out amazingly easily. Prototype. Try. Play. Kill if it doesn&#8217;t work. I like the spirit. Looking forward to see this evolve.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;(Comment: As originally posted on the OUBS Blog)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The word communication has been derived from the latin word communare, meaning &quot;to impart&quot; or &quot;to share&quot;. It is used a lot broader though as computers seem to communicate via phone lines in our language. Telephones however don&#8217;t. In a company&#8217;s shareholder meeting it might be unclear who is communicating, the company or the executives and the communication might also be one way. If you don&#8217;t respond to someone, are you only not talking or also communicating on a non-voice level? All this is not simple. The exploration follows.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Many would argue that machines fail to communicate because they lack intention and understanding. But this is now wrong in that with the advent of web services there is a way for machines to communicate. The semantic web is another idea that will further the possibility for computers to understand.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Key issues with communication are: symbols, messages, interpretation, understanding, meaning, interaction, intention and persuasion. If you put all of this together you end up in stories.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theories of Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The SMCR Model of communication is one way of seeing it:
Sender -&gt; Message via Channel -&gt; Receiver&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;More complex systems also include a coder and decoder. Noise and interference are also often noted. To overcome communications problems in this model, you can use redundancy in the message or feedback. This is the difference between UDP and TCP as an internet communications protocol for example. In TCP the other side says that it has received a message creating some overhead. In UDP you do not need this having less overhead but at the same time needing some overlap to be able to piece together the data even if some parts are lost. Another thing is that English text and normally be reduced by 30% and still be understandable. Mac OS X, the operating system by Apple, has a system wide summary function for example which often yields some very nice results.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are strengths and weaknesses in the information theory model. It is very well understood and can very easily be applied and used. But, it does not address meaning, understanding or interpretation. AT the same time it sees the message as the communication, not the way to get a certain behavior from the receiver. Communication problems in our real world kind of prove that its just not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;An alternative is the constructivist model. It sees people as constructing mental images and models used to make sense of the world. IT places weight on the difference of individuals. For newborns for example the world is a &quot;buzzing booming confusion&quot; as psychologist William James (1890) said, before it learns and makes sense of the world at least. You construct your understanding and are only conscious of those things that you need to be aware of at any time.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;For example, when you started out driving, you might have had problems to listen to the radio at the same time. This becomes easier as you need to put less direct attention to driving. You might even have noticed that you suddenly become aware that you do not remember the last few seconds driving. Your subconscious took over there and would have put your conscious in the drivers seat again if something happened.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The person we wish to communicate with is different from us by culture, age, gender, experience, &#8230; hence the message we send might be interpreted differently. The constructivist will acknowledge the likelihood of different interpretations and to find shared meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Bennet made a six step model for empathy in this model:
- assuming difference
- knowing self
- suspending self
- allowing guided imagination
- allowing empathetic experience
- re-establishing self&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This leads us to semiotics, the idea that we communicate through signs (words, images, acts, objects, &#8230;). These signs might be arbitrary but only as long as they don&#8217;t become a community standard. All signs have certain codes behind them Chandler argues that. Learning these codes involves adopting the values, assumptions, and world-views which are built into them without (our) normally being aware of their intervention in constructing of reality.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This is used all around us, like in ads, where a signifier is used to convey a certain image idea or codes. The process is as follows:
Signifier -&gt; Signify -&gt; (social) beliefs and attitudes -&gt; larger assumptions&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This also leads to the concept of branding in that you create an identity for a product and that people are made to buy into a lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication and Culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The concept of culture was first used in writing by Edward &amp; Taylor in 1871. It is again hard to define. I personally liked the simple on the one from Stradley (1980): The acquired knowledge that people use to interpret experience and generate social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Of course there is a bit of ambiguity in there, as to how knowledge was acquired or codified. But it seems that knowledge happens in context, in a culture. There is also no real world or real knowledge if you look at it like this. You need to ask yourself how much culture fit is needed in knowledge and how constructivistic do you need to get.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Going from here we need to look at language and ethnography. Ethnography was developed as a sub-branch of anthropology concerned with the different ethnic cultures. A central focus has always been on language. e.g. a culture in Afrika has no language concept for numbers. They have the values &quot;some&quot; and &quot;many&quot;. Just think of the limits this puts on knowledge or the opportunities it creates.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: <a href="http://www.stevedix.de/">Steve</a> pointed out that they do theoretically have a concept for numbers. None, some, many. It&#8217;s just a different one from mine. Okok ;))&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Hofstede did one of the best known studies on different ethnic cultures within IBM which you can read about <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/2004/06/creativity_and__4.html">here</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A nice example cited in the book is this. Americans say: Don&#8217;t just sit there - do something. Japanese might say: Don&#8217;t just do something - sit there.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culture as a knowledge system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;White put it like this in 1959: (Culture does not exist of) extra-somatic things and events&#8230; (but) consists of things and events considered within an extra-somatic context. [Extra-somatic meaning outside or beyond a person.]&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This means that you can study culture based on the things around it. Culture is our frame of reference. This leads to the idea of distributed cognition and potentially even collective knowledge. Then start thinking about individual knowledge and corporation knowledge and hear your brain boiling over ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizational Culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;It is argued that this should fit the environment and hence there potentially isn&#8217;t a best culture out there for a company. The culture might even have to change over time, especially with faced with technological discontinuities. Deal and Kennedy categorized companies&#8217; culture into, yes, you guessed it, a quadrant.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Feedback quick and risk high: Tough guy, macho
Feedback quick and risk low: Work hard, play hard
Feedback slow and risk high: bet-your-company culture
Feedback slow and risk low: process culture&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The internet now really enabled the work hard play hard culture because we can have amazingly quick feedback in low risk environment.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication, culture and managing knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Personal knowledge is deeply linked to our mindsets. A Vietnamese will be unaware that a &quot;brother&quot; can be referred to without giving an age. These tacit models are important to keep in mind. Knowledge is contextual and the empathy model suggests that this context is very important.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Communication via stories has a long history here because it is one of the most important ways to transfer knowledge. Snowden argues that they work so well because they are simple, non-threatening, memorable and can bring across complicated ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome blogging, sorry drifting off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication and Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This section is intended to provide a framework and can be summarized roughly as &#8230; (ok not so easy to do rough but anyway)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Learning is key to knowledge and thinking. It has a function of diminishing returns as more learning will become harder along the way (learning curve). Learning is also culturally influenced as well as by our mental models in general. The question arises whether all thinking requires speech and hence language has a high influence. Speed reading might be a good way to think about this.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This also means that the human brain does not work in a vacuum. Different people learn better at different stages of Kolb&#8217;s learning cycle. There is a theorist, pragmatist, activist and reflector. Learning seems to be messier and more context sensitive though. You need critical attention for learning and double loop learning to go to the next level. At the same time the brain seems to have an easier time recalling things if you are in a similar situation or state of mind than when you remembered them. Still, the situation where you need to apply what you learned will need to different in context from that where you learn.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Communications and media systems is the last part in this. Stories here have been even more important and media evolved from speech to writing and then to cheaper writing, images, movies, &#8230; . There is also the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication types here, where the Delphi method of creativity is quoted.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;(Comment: TypePad&#8217;s new WYSIWYG editor seems to be eating my conent. When you see a &lt;I&gt;Link: blah&lt;/I&gt; post, it&#8217;s just a post having been eaten, so here I go again.)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The Business 2.0 Blog has a great post entitled <a href="http://business2.blogs.com/business2blog/2004/11/worlds_smartest.html">World&#8217;s Smartest Wine Bar</a> showing us how you can drink wine by the glass for months from 16 bottles. The idea is that you have the bottles mounted to the $20.000 system and get out a glass each time. Then the bottle is filled with argon to keep it from oxidating. Even white wine seems to last for 2 months, so red wine possibly longer. For 16 bottles this should be enough.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I do love wine and do love to have a glass in the evening but you can&#8217;t just let the bottle stand somewhere for ages. As a small tipp though, you can put a full glass in the kitchen over night and the way the wine tasts the next morning is similar to how it would taste if it were to age in the bottle in the cellar for a year. This is just due to the different of oxidation in the closed bottle or the glass. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;d love to have a wine cellar with this thing in the middle being my lovely wine dispenser. Sadly I neither have $20.000 to spend on a wine dispenser nor $200.000 on a good wine celler with wine. :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;You might wonder if I will now talk about <a href="http://www.recruiting.com/blogger_jobs/">Blogger Jobs</a> but that&#8217;s not the case. I am actually just talking about the fact that one reason to keep a blog is that it&#8217;s a wonderful engine to drive intrest in yourself and to further your connections. It is very likely that you will get a job offer via your blog or that it will at least help you in getting the right job for you. This is very evident in a series of posts you can find on Jeremy Zawodny&#8217;s blog. It started with <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003059.html">Russel Yahooing soon</a>, follow by <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003062.html">Jeremy Cole doing it too!</a>. Russel talks <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008168.html">a bit more deeply</a> about his move to Yahoo!, which is quite interesting.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Ok, this is scary. A Gallup Poll had some interesting results. I quote from their page:</p>

<p>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.gallup.com/poll/content/login.aspx?ci=14107&quot;&gt;Only about a third of Americans believe that Charles Darwin&#8217;s theory of evolution is a scientific theory that has been well supported by the evidence, [&#8230;] Forty-five percent of Americans also believe that God created human beings pretty much in their present form about 10,000 years ago. A third of Americans are biblical literalists who believe that the Bible is the actual word of God and is to be taken literally, word for word.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Ok people. This is a tiny bit scary here. I have no problem with religion whatsoever. But 45% of Americans believe God created Human beings 10.000 years ago? Okok, I might have to see the real questions to fully judge if this is really the case, but all in all, this is &#8230; I have no word. Let me repeat that I have no problem with living by the Bible, which is wonderful, but scientific evidence highly suggests that this evolution thing is true. Then again, maybe all this was wrong and <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2002/04/the_stargate_co.html">34000 years ago Tom gave birth to all this</a> :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

But it is true that it sometimes is a weird thing that you go home or to friends and the first thing that happens is the question &quot;Can you fix my computer?&quot; :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Currently the blogosphere is linking to &lt;a title=&quot;EPIC 2014&quot; href=&quot;http://hyku.com/epic/&quot;&gt;EPIC 2014&lt;/a&gt; which is talking about the future of media in a wonderful way. Googlezon is the merger of Google and Amazon, after Google bought TiVo by the way. Welcome EPIC. Cool stuff, a little bit scary and very insightful and thought provoking.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;While I am at it, SiliconBeat <a href="http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2004/11/19/why_google_wins_with_users.html">links to</a> a <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/dtls_dsp_SearchInsider.cfm?fnl=041118">post</a> on MediaPost which talks about why Google is winning and I have been saying that without end to people around me. This is why Google is understanding! They even talk about it in their conference calls to investors. First comes a service that attracts users and when there are millions of them then they think about monetizing it without destroying the idea behind it. All this EPIC stuff would be good for the user, as long as some other stuff in there does not happen. This makes the challenge interesting, as good for the user might not equate good for society at large. That&#8217;s probably the next step.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
