  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://xing.com">Xing</a> just <a href="http://blog.xing.com/2008/04/put-your-contac.html">opened up their Maps Beta</a> for putting your contacts on a map. I&#8217;ve been playing with this for some time and while seemingly a simple feature, the implementation rocks.</p>

<p>Within your Address Book you will not have a Maps link that will simply show your contacts on a map. Dependent on your Zoom level, you will have several contacts grouped together. These groupings then change when you zoom in. The fun thing is that you can filter based on your tags, or search for a city, to see which contacts you have in that city. Sadly the system does not allow you to mix and match searches and tags, allowing you to e.g. search for customers in berlin. You do have a preview of the contact data within the ad though.</p>

<p>&lt;a href=&#8217;http://blog.thylmann.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/picture-1.png&#8217;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.thylmann.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/picture-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Xing Contacts Map&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;221&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2349&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>But it is a good first step and I am looking forward to seeing more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few days and even weeks a few things clogged up my bookmarks folder entitled &quot;To Blog&quot; which I haven&#8217;t done up till now. It&#8217;s about time that I finally get them out of here, be it as a summary of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Ingmar <a href="http://www.fredlog.de/blog/2008/04/couch-potatoe.html">pointed me</a> to <a href="http://zattoo.com/">Zattoo</a>, which is giving you TV on your computer and it seems to be working really well and they already have 46 channels in Germany as well as many in several other countries. I am still waiting for TV/Computer/Streaming/&#8230; to be fully integrated. I think Podcasting will fully take off once we have nocat of 3G enabled car radios with clients, and Videocasting will take off once my TV can effortlessly let me subscribe to Diggnation, News, Whatever. Zattoo might help to keep live shows available.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;<a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTkwMDk">Dropbox</a> is something I am starting to really love as a startup. They are using Amazon&#8217;s S3 as a storage solution and have built a nice little tool for windows and os x that will automatically sync everything you put into a special folder with your cloud based storage. Due to the fact that you can install your app on two computers you can sync several gigs of storage between two computers, and the fun thing is that you can share a special folder with another person all together. So if I put something in my &quot;Shared with Henning&quot; folder (could have chosen a wiser name, but this makes it easy to understand ;)) it is moved into the cloud, and when Henning turns on his computer, it will appear in his folder and everything is dandy. I really love the system they build. The opportunities are endless and that I love Amazon&#8217;s system is clear. This is a very clever way to use the service and the syncing part with revisions is great!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;<a href="http://friendfeed.com">Friendfeed</a> is something that is making the rounds at the moment and the Twitterati are signing up in big numbers. As I had discussions with Dirk about <a href="http://noserub.com">Noserub</a> for ages, it all felt very familiar. The thing is that it is build by ex-Googlers and there are some things weird about it. I for one do not really feel like adding friends on the system but just people of whom I want to have access to all their feeds. As the feeds are managed by each individual user, I am always up to date on what these &quot;friends&quot; wright about. Then Friendfeed added search and I started adding &quot;Friends&quot; like crazy, choosing people that I respect and like. I have the slight feeling that it might become a form of search engine for me in the future. Using Friendfeed to follow your friends is a totally nutcase idea anyway. There are a gazillion filters missing and Friendfeed is actually not focussed enough to allow it from a mindset of the users I think.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then there was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/11/mybloglog-hits-the-streets-with-bluetooth-based-user-detection/">this story on Techcrunch</a> about MyBlogLog launching a Bluetooth type network. I am still wondering if this is a joke. The thing is that this makes MyBlogLog even more scary as a data gathering system, but mot of all I am wondering if people are nuts again. Bluetooth is not there to create a social network, something some people seem to be thinking at the moment. Aka-Aki in Germany seems to be one of those. The thing is that the amount of people you need in the network is way too high, leaving bluetooth on is a major security hazard waiting to happen, and once you are in my bluetooth range i can probably see you! :) People, get real! It&#8217;s a fun toy, but this is not and should not happen.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then we had the launch of the Google App Engine. I got an account for our hosted system for <a href="https://ormigo.com">Ormigo</a> and we might be playing with it some time. Feld <a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2008/04/what_exactly_is.html">has a few good links about it</a>Â and Tim O&#8217;Reilly is thinking whether Google App Engine is nothing more than a <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2008/04/is-google-app-engine-a-lockin.html">lock-in play</a>. I do love the general idea of the App Engine, in that you do not have to worry about anything other than writing your code. But you do have to write it within the Google App Engine and write it in Python. So it is a kind of lock-in. But then <a href="http://waxy.org/2008/04/exclusive_google_app_engine_ported_to_amazons_ec2/">comes Andy Baio</a> writing about <a href="http://jchris.mfdz.com/code/2008/4/announcing_appdrop_com__host_go">Chris Anderson launching AddDrop</a>. AddDrop is a container for apps written with Google&#8217;s AppEngine SDK to be run directly on Amazon&#8217;s EC2. Now how cool is that!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;And this brings us back to one of my favorite topics, Amazon, who announced a <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2008/04/block-to-the-fu.html">persistent storage feature for EC2</a>. Before I blabber along on how cool that is, just read <a href="http://blog.rightscale.com/2008/04/13/amazon-takes-ec2-to-the-next-level-with-persistent-storage-volumes/">this from RightScale&#8217;s Thorsten vok Eiken</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;That concludes my little summary for today. Have a great weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago I posted about Ormigo being nominated as a winner for the Red Herring Europe 2008, and now (before the post gets pushed from the front page due to light blogging ;)) I can say that we are among the 100 winners! If we counted correctly there are 12 winners in Germany and 3 of those are in Cologne. :)</p>

<p>Henning is now in Malta accepting the award for us and probably having some thought provoking discussions with other entrepreneurs.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two blog posts got me back on a certain subject I thought I&#8217;d write about again. First of all, Mark Cuban posted &quot;<a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/2008/04/03/i-couldnt-resist/">I couldn&#8217;t resist &#8230; Youtube vs. Broadcast.com 10 years ago</a>&quot; in which he compares YouTube and Broadcast.com. Yes it is not a 100% comparison, but interesting none the less. Then I found &quot;<a href="http://mathewingram.com/media/2008/03/24/ad-networks-inventory-vs-the-brand/">Ad Networks: Inventory vs. the brand</a>&quot; by Mathew Ingram (via <a href="http://www.simonwaldman.net/2008/04/03/links-for-2008-04-03/">Simon</a>). From that post just see this part from the end:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Maybe itâs just the spillover from the sub-prime mortgage meltdown, but in some cases packaging remnant inventory and selling it through an ad network reminds me of the Wall Street practice of bundling underperforming or questionable mortgages together, and âsecuritizingâ them in order to unload them onto outside investors. That kind of strategy works really well â right up until it doesnât.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Back in the first bubble I was running a statistics service for webmasters and we were using Flycast, which very soon folded because that network kind of did not work. Next up for us was <a href="http://tribalfusion.com/">Tribalfusion</a>, and they survived. One of the features I really liked about them was that I could put ads into their system on my site myself for free. Very cool indeed. Seems a bit like Google&#8217;s AdManager today. Then there was Doubleclick for the big sites, which was not just a service to use and pay for as a publisher or agency, but a real network selling your inventory, until they stopped doing it when the marketing money ran out. So we had networks, and we had targeting, and we had lots of reach and bundling over different bigger sites.</p>

<p>I do believe that we are running down a similar road and we&#8217;ll see if lots of those networks out there will survive today. There is a lot more reach out there of course but one of the biggest differences we have is that the cost side has really really changed. You can have more server power and reach for stuff like behavioral targeting and costs for ad servers has gone way down, as has bandwidth. This allows both better targeting and and created networks that can run on the unsold inventory, because even with several cents CPM you can still run profitably. Also there are more real marketing dollars out there obviously.</p>

<p>Sadly the latter gave rise to ads that are not something you want on your site. The thing is that often times, cheesy ads that have higher click throughs to worse conversion but yield higher ecpms in the end. That is why you have these weird flashing banners, or texts that are totally unreasonable like &quot;You are the 1.000.000th Visitor and you Won!&quot;</p>

<p>As always these are interesting times, and I 100% believe in networks with a clear focus, as I wouldn&#8217;t run one otherwise. But we are focusing on filling inventory with marketing budgets from small local players in a performance marketing manner, making you other money. Others allow for exploiting your inventory through behavioral targeting techniques, making you more money. Still others are bundling smaller sites, who are allowing them to make money at all. All have to watch out what they stand for and that they are really providing value over and beyond the other solutions out there. And all have to make sure they can compete with Google, on which ever level that is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seems that <a href="http://loiclemeur.com">Loic</a> once again brought a <a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2008/03/my-social-map-i.html">good discussion</a> to the house that we have been having several times over though under the name of Open <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/tag/social-graph/">Social Graph</a>. Where does my social graph reside, whom does it belong to? I am writing more and more about this first of all because it is a subject dear to my heard, second I am in lots of discussion with <a href="http://olbertz.de">Dirk</a>, one of <a href="https://ormigo.com">Ormigo</a>&#8217;s developers, about it, and third, it is relevant to what we do within Ormigo in terms of the long term vision.</p>

<p>What Loic really wants is already available through e.g. <a href="http://noserub.com/">Noserub</a>. The tools is only a side project but it is getting more and more attention and due to the fact that it is open-source, you can just install it on your server. <a href="http://id.thylmann.net/othylmann">id.thylmann.net/othylmann</a> is my account on my own Noserub Server for example. I&#8217;m likely moving that soon, because the fun thing is that all the data belongs to you, you can ex- and import it, and you can add friends simply through adding any of their URLs. In the end it is all about the Data Portability that Michael talks about in his <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/03/30/friendfeed-the-centralized-me-and-data-portability/">Techcrunch Post</a>.</p>

<p>Noserub is just an example implementation of what it will mean in the end. Being able to port around your data, adding friends through URLs with the help of Google&#8217;s Open Social API, and more. And you can create special RSS Feeds within Noserub allowing you to then put that RSS Feed on your blog. But the thing is that even though Loic now believes that he wants his Blog to be the center of his life again, I am not sure he means that. We still need some new Design to handle all our social life and display it for all to see. It&#8217;s too much content and actually, privacy is still something that we really need to care for.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;How I love <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon AWS</a>. In October there were already <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2007/10/09/amazon-aws-sla-and-unique-ip/">hints about Static IPs</a> and now they are here. Check out the <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2008/03/new-ec2-feature.html">Amazon Web Services Blog post</a> about all of the new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;First of all, we now have what they call Elastic IP Addresses and the system is very cool. You get up to 5 IPs to start with. You get one via an API call to AllocateAddress, which allocates you one fixed IP that then belongs to you. Without you using it you pay 1 cent per hour. But you can then do an AssociateAddress and it is attached to a Server and becomes free, meaning you no longer pay for its usage. You can then DisassociateAddress and ReleaseAddress if you do not plan to use it at all.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then couple that with Availability Zones, which are zones in their Network Infrastructure that are insulated from each other so that if one zone goes down, another does not (in theory, there might always be odd cases, chance if you want ;)).&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This really means you can do more for a high availability solution with Amazon AWS and if they now start a NOC in Germany, I will possibly never do my own Server again. But they are not here yet so we are just using it for parts of our system, and I am taking a look at <a href="http://globalways.net">Globalways</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;But again, congratulations to the entire Team behind Amazon EC2 for pulling this one of. Thank you. No more DynDNS for our Ad Server :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;I am starting to figure out that the only social network I am really using often is <a href="http://xing.com/">Xing</a>. This is for one simple reasons: It is becoming my address book. This is really what Xing should be focussing on in my mind. Marketplace and all is nice, but there is an amazing value to be created from simply making sure that it becomes my address book. Once Xing becomes my address book there is actually no synchronization problem anymore. My data store is Xing. I don&#8217;t want to Sync. I want Xing to be my address book. If there is somebody not in Xing I want to be able to add that person to my Pool of contacts and if it through social apis they will be able to get more information about them from the web. I want full access on the go, an app for the iPhone, S60 phones, Mac Addressbook Plugin, a great mobile html version, &#8230; . We are moving to an always on world and I one thing that is still not online for me is my address book. eMails are online through GMail but the address book is only synchronized between several devices.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So there you go, needed to get that off my chest. Please enhance Xing to be my address book. Always there, with everybody I have in my rolodex, in Xing or not.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Enough of the rambling. These 2 minutes writing helped get that of my chest ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We are looking for a few new people to bolster our development team at <a href="https://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a>. If you know German, just go to our <a href="http://blog.ormigo.com/jobs/">jobs section</a>, but if you don&#8217;t we are still happy to hear form you. The entire documentation, trac, wiki, is in english anyway. For those not knowing what we do, we are making the local market advertisable in a scalable way, helping local merchants to gain new customers. So there is ad server stuff to do (on Amazon&#8217;s AWS Infrastructure), billing backends to handle, statistical analysis with loads of data, optimization of lead processes, design frameworks for landing pages, customer care infrastructure with loads of people on the phone, lots of micro formats, &#8230; . Most of what we have done up till now is not visible to the naked eye. The opportunities are endless, which is exactly why we chose that market.</p>

<p>So here is a short summary of the jobs currently advertised for the development team:
&lt;ul&gt;</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Web Developer: Our platform is written in CakePHP and we are looking for a core PHP developer, somebody with the experience to know to write unit tests first, and code second. Knowledge with recommendation engines, ad servers, cloud computing, scaling big systems, ... is always appreciated.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Web Designer / Producer: We need somebody that knows HTML and CSS inside out, has design knowledge, understands a bit of JavaScript and possibly PHP. This has a real focus on the generation of customer contacts for local merchants, over hundreds of products, with loads of different partners running ads, ... handling all of this in a scalable manner.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;System Administrator: This is actually the best overarching title that I came up with. We don't really have titles at Ormigo, but sys admin seems to be fitting to some extent. We need somebody to take care of the servers in-house, which includes handing our Amazon infrastructure, deploy processes, customer care infrastructure, testing environment, and so on. Dependent on the person, I can see them focussing more on the stuff other than direct server management, which would be their responsibility, but possibly not doing.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
</code></pre>

<p>&lt;/ul&gt;
So those are the main positions we are looking for at the moment. Leave a comment or mail me at oliver at thylmann.com with your documents. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Back at home after a great day back at work, I am starting to reflect about Wednesday and Thursday at the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2008/03/11/nokia-idea-generation-workshop/">Nokia Idea Generation Workshop</a>. What an amazing two days. Nokia made sure that all our needs were cared for, to be able to fully concentrate on the work shop. The <a href="http://www.stmartinslane.com/">St. Martin&#8217;s Lane</a> Hotel was amazing and a challenge to the senses, and this was followed by a very good dinner in the beautiful setting of the Sketch Restaurant. With some great wine, and Mojitos later at the St. Martin Lane&#8217;s bar, the evening was full of great conversations on and off-topic.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The thing is that the crowd was wonderful and everybody wanted to stay in contact afterwards. We were fortunate to have some amazing people from Nokia but also from very diverse fields in the location that helped having a free spirit and open discussions: <a href="http://www.14henrietta.com/">14 Henrietta Street</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Sadly there is not a lot more I can rave about as I can&#8217;t talk about the content, even though it wouldn&#8217;t be too interesting for all of you out there if you weren&#8217;t part of the talks to get there. Thanks go especially to <a href="http://www.managementinnovationgroup.com/principals/scott-hirsch/">Scott Hirsh</a> who was a great facilitator, always being in the background and nudging us back on track if the excitement of one special subject got the better of us ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I do not want to single out any one person from the gang that was there, so I will leave it at that, other that I have to post about my new Nokia N810 soon, thanks, which is an amazing step forward from the Nokia N770 that I already have. I am really seeing myself using it, already have stuff like a last.fm clients, media system, ssh, skype, and others installed. But more on that in another post.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for challenging discussions, great insight, and listening to the world around you! Looking forward to the next meeting.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
