  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am actually starting to think a bit more about <a href="http://www.united-internet.de/">United Internet</a> as an investment. They are getting awfully big, have some great service already and are only now moving from Germany to the US. 1&amp;1 is one of the biggest hosting providers out there. GMX has arround 15 Million eMail accounts and 12.000 new ones per day. 200.000 are paying member with 50k added per quarter. 1&amp;1 had 2 million hosting customers. Much more info is in their last years <a href="http://www.united-internet.de/website/content/ir/berichte/Roadshow%20USA%2002.06.%20-%2006.06.2003.pdf">USA Roadshow Presentation</a>.</p>

<p>They are valued relatively highly (<a href="http://aktien.onvista.de/snapshot.html?ID_OSI=81232">stock quote</a>) but then again they didn&#8217;t really push into other countries too hard yet. Thinking.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; United Internet just opened up <a href="http://www.alturo.de/">Alturo.de</a> as a low end web host for self serve customers. 40 EURs per month get you your own server, with full root access, mysql, php, the works, inclusive 150 GB of traffic. It makes you wonder how they pay for it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.united-domains.de/">United Domains</a> is it then. I just registered yesterday to get two domains and I will transfer what I have over to the service. First of all it is dead cheap and you can buy domains from practically everywhere.  You can have .biz, .info, .be, .de, .com/net/org, .jp, .info and also all the fun domains with Ã„Ã–Ãœ when they come out in March. You also have full eMail forwarding, full redirection of your domains as well as control over all the revelevant DNS entries if you want to go that far.</p>

<p>&lt;B&gt;Update 2:&lt;/B&gt; They are part of Lycos Europe since January 2004 and while I did previously think they were part of United Internet, they are not, even though the name makes it quite confising. I put my ramblings on United Internet in a seperate post then :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been saying again and again that RSS, or syndication formts like it (e.g. Atom), have a great future ahead of them. I was reminded of that fact when I read <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001550.html">this post</a> by Jeremy Zawodny, where he explains that he is currently quizzed about RSS very frequently at work. With his work being Yahoo!, this has a bit of weight.</p>

<time datetime="2004-02-04T15:02:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 4<span>th</span>, 2004</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;We now have the ratios based on the annual report of some company. The next step would be to try to &lt;i&gt;guess&lt;/i&gt; what the future might look like. Who else might be interested in the future performance of a company? Investors, lenders, managers (internal and external), employees, debt providers, &#8230; . All of them need to know the decision they want to take to be able to ask the right questions about the future.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>For your forecast, scenarios, remember:
- strategic change is only possible to push through by powerful stakeholders, meaning that most will have to forecast based on existing strategies
- sometimes only the likelyhood of the worst outcome is needed
- the timeperiod depends on your goal, e.g. repayment of a 5 year bond needs 5 year forecast
- which cash flows should you include relate to which are available to you&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Forecasting is an imprecise art, with lots of assumptions, which need to be checked if the real outcomes differ from your assumptions. Most of your assumptions will turn out to have been wrong. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sales and profitability&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You should look at the continuing core-activities, where the potentials reflect the economic situation in general and in the sector. The actual performance comes more from inside the company. You actually start your forecast from the top to bottom of the income statement.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sales
In large comglomerates you need to break things down into small, easy to understand, homogeneous, appropriate groups. The division here can be regional, devisional, or any other logical one.
Take into account that some things might have been integrated or sold in the middle of the year.
Also take into account the general economic environment (GNP = gross national product; GDP = gross domestic product). Normally, a company can only grow faster than the economy by capturing market share. You can actually use that to see what growth in relation to the sector has been in the past, to get clues as to the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;[In general I deviate from the course here a little because I do believe that Fisher and Buffet have it right when they say that you need to understand the business. Understanding the numbers is not enough. ]&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;If the company changed the strategy, whether or not a competitor response is likely, if capacity will limit growth in sales, can sales be physically produced, &#8230; are the limits on scarce resources &#8230; all this need to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To get more information on the sector you can do a porter analysis. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To forecast profits, you need the profit margin and adjust it for any changes you think are likely. This includes effects of the economic cycle, especially in industries with high fixed costs. Competitors strategies are also important. Samsung for example really wanted to get into the mobile phones space and it hurt Nokia&#8217;s volumes.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asset investment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Next you need to forecast operating cash, NOP, fixed assets and investments. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;NOP: NOP/Sales will likely be constant without strategy change. Otherwise forecast underlying assets and liabilities. Also think whether the ratio will improve or fall based on management capabilities. Pay attention that you do not work with working capital as this includes several non-operating items (e.g. marketable securities, short term portion of long term dept, &#8230;) which have no real relation to sales.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Cash: A company might need it for production or strategic reasons. Find the transactionally needed cash balance. This is also what makes ratios hard to use as it mixes transactional and investment cash balances. You can as always use the sector ratios as guidance. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Fixed assets: Take historic paterns and peer comparison into account. Net fixed assets turnover ratio is good as it allows you to find out what kind of investment in fixed assets is needed to support forecasted sales. Pay attention to depreciation though to be sure that you are comparing current sales to current fixed assets value. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Financial Structure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Here you take a look at debt, provisions, new funding needed and equity. New funding can come from new debt, equity or retained profits/losses. In the short term, you will take your profitability assumptions, mixing them with your assumption that new funds  will be in the form of debt.  In the long term, analysts normally presume a fixed debt/equity ratio. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Retained profit (loss) = (NOP - Old debt x interest - New debt x interest) ( 1-Taxes) - Minority interests - Dividends.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You may need to find out about seasonabel borrowings which might be hinted at via a historic interest expense to average debt ratio above what the market gives as interest rates. Dividends can be seen as something that a company has to pay when looking at the short term, taking a growth rate into account, while longer term analysis can take a percentage of profit earned as a more appropriate measurement.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In the long term, new funding needed will also include new equity. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assessing Trading Partners&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To assess trading partners you will likely take a look at a short period of between 30 and 90 days. There are some challenges here:
- Quick decisions needed
- Monitoring costs might be too high for benefit
- Financial information is often only available several months after balance sheet date
- No information for privately owned companies&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Often you use a credit reference agency or credit rating agencies (Moody&#8217;s, S&amp;P, &#8230;) for longer time horizons. In addition to financial information and ratios, credit reports often have peer comparisons and also include single measures based on several factors, like Experian, who publish a rating of 1 to 100 based on 20 factors. Experian does that by also collecting information from different companies on how they are paid by their partners, resulting in a DBT (days beyond term) number. It is important to distinguish between willingness and ability to pay here, as cash management is an important part and might result in later payments if the bargaining power is on the paying end.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forecasting debt capacity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Banks will look at the longer term to find out if the company has the capacity to take on (more) debt. For this to be possible the company needs to be able to meet all obligations ranking with the same importance as the new debt. Direct lenders will do their own credit assessment, while credit rating agencies help in terms of bond sales and other vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Banks lend money based a market rate (Base Rate, LIBOR [London interbank offered rate], EURIBOR [Euro interbank offered rate]) plus a spread known as the credit risk premium. The different between what the bank pays for funds and what it gets can be very low (e.g. 0.125%) up to something like 3% (rarely above). To be sure that payments are made, the bank will make conservative forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;NOP + Depreciation - TAx - CAPEX +/- Change in noa +/- change in minimum cash balances - after-tax interest on seasonable debt - dividends = cash available to service debt&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Seasonable debt and dividends are optional here. Also take into account the NPV of those cash flows. The discount rate to use is the companies borrowing rate. You can also substract current portion of long term debt as well as after-tax interest on existing debt to be even more sure. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Company Valuations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Here the book looks at DCF valuation methods. You will normally calculate the value of a company over two time periods. One being the present values of cash flows in your forecast period and the other being the cash flows following that period as a whole. The second part is called continuing or residual value. Small shareholders cannot influence the strategy of the company should hence take the current strategy for their forecasts. You should also calculate the worst case, most likely case and best case. You can then look at a probability of each of those outcomes. As a potential shareholder you work backwards in the sense that you know what you would pay and then calculate what kind of assumptions you would need to make to get to that value, or you simply find out that the current price is too high or low. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Ensure that the discount factor is consistent with the cash flows to be discounted. Normally the nominal values re used. Take into account that debt might have tax benefits. The present value of nominal free cash flows during the forecast period plus the terminal/residual value will be the enterprise value. Adding investment and substracting debt from that (both at market value) you get the total equity value. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;EBITDA = NOP + Depreciation
Free cash flow = EBITDA - Taxes - CAPEX +/- change in noa +/- change in op. cash +/- other&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The present value of free cash flows can be calculated with the WACC which reflects the debt/equity ratio. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Value drivers are those relationships or ratios that largely determine the free cash flow. Operating margins are one. Taxes paid another. Remember here that the taxes mentioned here are those payable as if the company had no debt. The savings due to the tax shelter in relation to debt are included in the discount rate calculated via the WACC.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some time ago, eBay has bought <a href="http://www.mobile.de/">mobile.de</a>, the biggest place in Germany to buy cars online. The interesting thing is that eBay said that the revenues through mobile.de will not have a big impact on their revenues. So it was about getting a competitor out of the way? Another idea is coming from Jeremy Zawodny in his post &lt;a title=&quot;eBay to use MySQL?&quot; href=&quot;http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001539.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;eBay to use MySQL?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So this would make mobile.de a tech buy, which is an interesting idea. It would be interesting to see companies that do push MySQL to the limits and what they are doing to get it performing well.</p>

<p>I am currently looking into simply getting MySQL to go very fast for web statistics purposes, which on the other end will result in huge amounts of data that need to be analysed. Thankfully I have the help of people that know a lot more about MySQL than I do :)</p>

<time datetime="2004-02-03T20:21:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 3<span>rd</span>, 2004</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read Tim Bray&#8217;s (<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/01/WhatNext">look at that resume!</a>) <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/30/OnSearchTOC">On Search, the Series</a> on my way to Oxford last week and it&#8217;s a truely great piece on the internals of building and/or running a search engine. Here are a few thoughts about the search space and a few interesting bits from his paper.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>He co-founded Open Text Index, which at one point was the only search engine next to Lycos and Infoseek it seems. Now of course there are lots of different players and I remember some of them from when I looked closer into EIPs (Enterprise Information Portals) some years back (an interesting space to say the least).  He also points out that one of the big historical players was WAIS, which is now part of Hummingbird (who are into EIPs) and can be found at <a href="http://www.wais.com/">wais.com</a>. Previously, back in the beginning to mid 1990s, you could get to it via &lt;i&gt;wais:&lt;/i&gt;, yep, that&#8217;s wais instead of http :) I can even remember using that when I got my first PC, which was running Windows 95 and was connected to the Internet via a 10mbit/s Laser on the roof of the student home.</p>

<p>But back to the subject of search. Now search systems cost well into the six digits, and some of it might even be warranted in the sense that some of the systems out there even build a Taxonomy of your Documents and order them into the right categories. Tim continues with some stats, saying that less than 0.5% of all search users use the &quot;advanced search&quot; screen, and they enter on average 1.3 words before hitting enter. This is with how little information a search engine will have to work with. They also almost never look at the second results page.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/18/HowSearchWorks">How Search Works</a> covers the basics of search-engine engineering, with docs, postings, words and the wonderful index. Great stuff to read if you are interested in how you can efficiently bring order into chaos.</p>

<p>He also has a great example of how hard it is for search engines to gather the meaning out of a sentence by just knowing the words. Check this: &quot;&lt;i&gt;Time flies like an arrow, but fruit flies like bananas.&lt;/i&gt;&quot; Another problem is german, where we have words made up of several different words. In the Oxford English Dictionary, &quot;set&quot;, &quot;run&quot;, &quot;get&quot; are the words with the longest entries.</p>

<p>As for Google, he concludes that it is more important how popular something is, than to know what it is about, &#8230; in search he means. And it&#8217;s an interested conclusion to take from how Google ranks it&#8217;s entries, by popularity, and that people perceive the order of the results to be good.</p>

<p>Another goodie for the SEM people out there, &lt;i&gt;frequencies matter more than counts&lt;/i&gt;, meaning that if there is a word that is very rare in your article, it will have more weight in searches than another word.</p>

<p>As for free open source search-engines, Tim Bray thinks that <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/">Lucene</a>, now part of Apache, is probably the best one out there. There is lots more stuff in there including infos on how to build your own crawler and, as a final article, his <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/12/16/BRF">Basic Resource Finder</a>, a search-engine that still needs to be built.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Is lost data really lost data? Based on <a href="http://birdhouse.org/blog/archives/001205.php">Scot&#8217;s post</a> on <a href="http://www.binarybiz.com/vlab/">Virtual Lab</a> it isn&#8217;t. Scot re-initialized some firewire drives that students at Berkley use, until he found out that he cleared one that would have needed a backup first by accident. His first idea was that all is lost but then he found <a href="http://www.binarybiz.com/vlab/">Virtual Lab</a>. To quote Scot:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;Took an hour to scan the 80GB drive, but it found everything that had been there before the wipe. And the angels up above sang hallelujah.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>They have a cool licensing plan too. You can scan for free, but to recover, you pay per GB. Of course they know that once they tell you that they found everything, there is no way you will not give them your credit card number. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Am I in the UK at the right time or not? I just arrived in Milton Hill House near Oxford for three days of talking finacial management as part of the OUBS Finance course for the MBA and was already happy that the hotel has a business center with free internet access. This is nice. But then, I saw a nice flyer at the reception saying that BT Openyone is hosting a wireless broadband week from january 26th until February 1st, meaning that you can surf at the BT Openzone Wifi hotspots for free, and there are 2000 of them in the UK.</p>

<p>Ah well I thought, that&#8217;s nice, not that there will be a BT hotspot out here in nowhere land but I figured I&#8217;d ask. And you know what? There is a BT Openzone hotspot right here at the bar area, all free, all powerful and there for the taking for the entire time of my stay, which is until February 1st. :) My luck.</p>

<p>I just posted some pics of the trip via the mobile phone to the <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/moblog/">Moblog</a> but now I will be able to just sync them over to the laptop and post them like that, making it a lot cheaper. Free Wifi rocks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Andy Rasking just bought a new computer, a G4 Powerbook from Apple to be exact, and he <a href="http://business2.blogs.com/business2blog/2004/01/ing_amazing.html">posted about it on the Business 2.0 blog</a>. I&#8217;d like to quote a few lines here as I totally agree. Unexplainable, but true:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;First, I typed the lead sentence of my nextBusiness 2.0 story in a Word document on a Vaio running XP. Then I typed the same sentence in a Word document on a PowerBook running OS X. And this, ladies and gentlemen, is the genius of Steve Jobs: The sentence looked cooler, weightier, hipper, more worth paying attention to &#8211; on the PowerBook. Writers and other creative artists know that this cannot be explained rationally. It just is, and it&#8217;s worth money.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>So there you have it, I am weird. On a side note, I tried out <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>, a blogging tool which <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1005956.html">Russel Beattie posted about</a>, yesterday and it does feel nice. Really. If you are looking for a blogging tool, check it out.</p>
