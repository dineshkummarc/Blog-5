  <div class="entry-content"><p>I believe in digital disruption and I do believe there is a lot that will change, but who am I telling that to my readers. I rarely blog about a blog but now Simon Waldman <a href="http://www.simonwaldman.net/2008/08/14/my-new-blog-digital-disruption/">started</a> a new one entitled: &quot;<a href="http://digitaldisruption.wordpress.com/">Digital Disruption</a>&quot; and it&#8217;s a great read, especially because it is from inside the fense. Simon is Director of Digital Strategy and Development at the Guardian Media Group.</p>

<p>Just read <a href="http://digitaldisruption.wordpress.com/2008/08/14/the-outsider-solution-chuck-away-your-businesswrong-wrong-wrong/">The Outsider Solution</a>, or <a href="http://digitaldisruption.wordpress.com/2008/08/13/margins-dividends-topline-growth/">post on the NYT</a>. Having met Simon some time ago I can only suggest reading the blog. He does get it as they say, and not only from a &quot;let&#8217;s go all digital&quot; point of view but from a real understanding of the newspaper business, with lots of discussions with all involved.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We all know Google is big, but today a few things popped up that should be shaking the media industry in its very foundation. Sadly, I doubt that will happen, partly because the media industry is profit focussed and partly because it does not really know what its core competence is.</p>

<p>Jason Calacanis recently sent out an email in relation to Google starting Knol entitled &quot;Is Google a content company?&quot; This included one nice list:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let&#8217;s run a test: what is the role of a content publisher?</p>

<ol>
<li>Secure talent</li>
<li>Distribute their work</li>
<li>Monetize that work</li>
<li>Pay the content creator for their work</li>
<li>Build a library of that work for future monetization&lt;/blockquote&gt;
If we can roughly agree that this is correct, then Google is a content company, at least with Knol, but possibly even because of the simple fact that many blogs are using AdSense. And if you look at some bigger publisher you are somebody wondering if Google didn&#8217;t secure their talent in an AdSense deal, is distributing their work via Google, monetizing it via AdSense, paying them a share and indexing the work for future monetization.</li>
</ol>


<p>So all in all, Google is becoming a publisher.</p>

<p>Obviously, next up is advertising, the monetization part. Google came to the monetization of search via text links by accident and largely copied Overture. And now with Knol, they are trying to monetize more of the second clicks, which is actually similar in AdSense. If people don&#8217;t click on an AdSense link right away, then let them do it in the second click. Of course it was all performance driven but that let out the branding part of the business.</p>

<p>Then Google bought Doubleclick and boy is the strategy amazing. Their Adsense covers the smaller 100k visitors sites and Doubleclick covers the rest. Just <a href="http://www.attributor.com/blog/get-your-fair-share-of-the-ad-network-pie/">check this Attributor post</a>. It&#8217;s scary.</p>

<p>Today Google announced <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/08/new-enhancements-on-google-content.html">a few new additions to their content network</a> &#8230; like Frequency Capping, which <a href="http://plentyoffish.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/googles-to-dominate-display-ads/">Plentyoffish is all happy about</a>, understandably so, and argues that it will make Google dominate display ads. I personally think the last two points are the scary ones:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-weight: bold;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Improved Ads Quality:&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; Brings performance improvements within the Google content network.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-weight: bold;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;View-Through Conversions&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;: Enables advertisers to gain insights on how many users visited their sites after seeing an ad. This helps advertisers determine the best places to advertise so users will see more relevant ads.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
</code></pre>

<p>&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
As a short background, what Google now does is serve a Doubleclick Cookie with each AdSense ad request, effectively creating one big cookie/profiling network over all Doubleclick and AdSense instances. But what are Doubleclick instances? Those are actually way more than the publisher installations DFP (Dart for Publishers) but also DFA (Dart for Advertisers). So an Agency like Pilot might run a DFA instance and use it to track AdImpressions of bookings they had, clicks as well as conversions. And this is where the scary part is. Those agencies will be able to (with a few twists) book directly into any AdSense placement that has image ads enabled. And they have a cookie about the user that clicks through having booked an Ad on a big publisher. Run a Frequency Capping campaign on a few of the biggest publishers out there where the audience is that you believe to want to attract, cookieing the user, then targeting them on AdSense. This model might still be a few days out but this is where this is going. At least, I have not heard yet that there will be no cookie sharing from DFA and DFP instances.</p>

<p>And on the other side, there are a lot of players out there that generate leads through Google&#8217;s clicks. This is a huge market, I know, and you know what&#8230; Google is going there too. Check out <a href="http://www.lorm.de/2008/08/07/google-merchant-search-beta/">Google Merchant Search Beta</a>, where Google is generating leads (possibly even sales, because they don&#8217;t say how the billing works) for credit institutes. Damn god.</p>

<p>Google is simply using their vast data pool to <a href="http://weblogs.hitwise.com/us-heather-hopkins/2008/07/google_lively_predictions_goog.html">take a look at what to launch next</a>. By now they are becoming a publisher, pushing further into advertising in both directions (clicks to leads and clicks to branding) and using their vast data pool to become more of the web. Bummer.</p>

<p>I see that many people out there do not want Google to become online Advertising but I am not sure if their &quot;don&#8217;t want to&quot; is linked to some strategy that is filtered through to the profit centers having no option but to use Google.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Houston we have a problem! I can&#8217;t get an iPhone now. This is related to some constraints that I will further elaborate. Dirk just sent me a link to <a href="http://www.pottblog.de/2008/07/15/t-mobile-und-das-mysterium-der-rufnummernmitnahme/">this post</a> by Jens Matheuszik from Pottblog who has the same problem (post in German) and I was contacted by one founder of a big startup that has since left that has the same problem again. So, where are we.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The iPhone is out, but we can&#8217;t get it &#8230; because we want to keep our old mobile phone number. Now there is something called &quot;Bundesnetzagentur&quot; here in Germany that sets some basic rules that the carriers (all of them) and gase providers and the like have to abide to. It&#8217;s done to foster competition. Some years ago one thing was done to allow you to more easily switch your mobile phone providers: You could take your number with you. As a background for the non-germans here, in Germany previously every carrier had their own number (e.g. 0171 xxxxxxx) for T-Mobile and that has now changed. There are some basic rules for how this works.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Let&#8217;s presume you are moving from Base (my current carrier) to T-Mobile. You can cancel you contract at Base at any time. As soon as there are 4 months (123 days to be exact) left in your current contract you can go to your new carrier and get a new contract with a request for number portability. You can do that later, but at the latest 4 weeks after your old contract ran out. Those are the rules by the Regulierungsbehörde. But remember, those are the minimum rules, how Jens above so wonderfully found out.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Back to my case. I cancelled my contract and I can theoretically get a new contract this Friday, when there are 123 days left on my old contract, requesting my number to be ported. The problem that now appeared is that T-Mobile says: Very good sir, please sign here, and as your contract ends on the 17th of October, we will be sending you your iPhone a few days before that with your new SIM card and you will have your new contract on the 18th of October, thank you for signing up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;WHAT?!?!? Yes, you read correctly, I would get the phone only at the end of my contract. Obviously I couldn&#8217;t let it rest at that, like Jens. Here are some things that do not work:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I cannot make Base cancel my contract sooner, even though I would offer to pay all the remaining fee.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I cannot make Base to give free the number and give me a temporary one.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I have to admit that I can understand Base's reasoning.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I cannot get the iPhone now from T-Mobile even though the contract would start in October. It is not important here that I would pay them the sign-up fee and so on now.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I cannot get the iPhone now and let the contract start now and get a temporary number from T-Mobile up until the old number is transferred (making them instant money)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I also cannot get the iPhone and use another contract I have at T-Mobile that is still running for a few weeks (end of September, never mind why that is, not important as I do not want to keep that number) making them instantly more money.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;It is not possible to extend my old T-Mobile contract with an old number and move the new number over when the old contract at Base expires.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
</code></pre>

<p>&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I am out of options. I sent them a mail to ask for a solution but have not received an answer yet. That mails is 3 days old now. But Jens has some interesting learnings that I can also confirm. Other carriers will give you a temporary number if you want to start a contract with them now and port the number over later. T-Mobile says that they can&#8217;t because the Regulierungsbehörde says so, but that is not true. They only say that the porting of the number cannot be requested sooner than 4 months before contract end and 1 month after contract end. Theoretically I should be able to go to T-Mobile at any date, say I want a new contract, get that, and port my old number over later. It&#8217;s not that hard in theory, unless of course all their billing system rely on not a customer number but on the mobile phone number, which again would be weird because I have a customer number in my online interface for the old contract. So again that can&#8217;t be the case. So they are not forbidden to give out temporary numbers. They are not forbidden to port over numbers to existing contracts. They are not forbidden to give me my phone now even though the contract starts later I would presume (and don&#8217;t tell me that I can cancel everything until the contract start, I would have to give back the phone then without having used that or I can&#8217;t or you have bad lawyers writing your contracts and I doubt that ;)). In any case, with T-Mobile being the biggest carrier in germany, or second biggest after Vodafone, no clue, I would presume they can handle giving me a temporary number, or letting me use my existing one if they don&#8217;t have one free anymore! This can&#8217;t be that hard.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In any case, this saga continues and I am looking forward to seeing if we find a resolution. Please leave a comment if you have similar problems, here or at Jens post. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I got an update from an email I sent. There is nothing they can do if I want to keep my number. The phone will be sent and the contract will start when my old contract expires. So I presume we need to go to PR and or Headquarters with this one :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oh damn. I was feeling all good about getting the new iPhone until a short while ago. A bit of background is needed.</p>

<p>I have a contract at another carrier, called Base, and cancelled my contract there, which ends 17th of October 2008 now. I do want to port over my number from Base to T-Mobile though. There is a rule that the number portability can be requested 4 months before the end of the contract, 18th of July in my case. I thought i would be getting a temporary number at T-Mobile then, but as I have just learnt, this is not the case. I can order now, and they can request the number porting on the 18th, but I will only get t he iPhone and the new contract in October. I am not sure why I should order now then ;)</p>

<p>There is a time limited pricing option for the iPhone introduction which might make me order the iPhone sooner but I am feeling a bit weird as I am sure that in 3 months a lot can happen and there might be some price changes again and other new options. I even called Base to see if they would not free up my number sooner, but that does not seem to work, which is another bad thing. The only thing I could do now is use my old number and get an iphone with that one, using the Base number through a Pre-Paid card, but that sounds like a really nutty idea.</p>

<p>Life is hard some times. No iPhone for me for another 3 months it seems. Good that my Parents gave me a gift-certificate for part of the price of the iPhone for my birthday a few weeks back. It will always be christmas until I check that now ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that is interesting news: <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000599.html">BOSS - The Next Step in our Open Search Ecosystem</a>. Techcrunch as a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/09/yahoo-radically-opens-web-search-with-boss/">positive note</a> and RWW thinks it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/yahoo_opens_its_search_engine.php">exciting news</a> and I have to agree. Of course as both also note there are limitations to all of this but it is a good first step.</p>

<p>In short, you will have full API access without rate limits to query the Yahoo! Search Backend, getting back results based on your query as for example JSON, being able to do with it whatever you like. In our case at Ormigo we might want to do searches for related pages within Ormigo, enhancing the results based on internal data we have and adding a few external links based on where they came in in the results.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://me.dium.com/">Me.dium</a> for example to see one company already using the system. Actually a very nice idea to use my and my friends surfing behaviour to give me the right results. Sadly I don&#8217;t see all my friends installing the browser bar so it is out for me.</p>

<p>In any case this will drive innovation in the space and I am looking forward to see what comes out of it. In the long run you will be able to pay CPM based or you will have to run their ads next to the search results, which makes it a little bit less altruistic, but that&#8217;s ok. For now, all is fair game, so go play.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nokia was kind enough to give me a Nokia N810 some time ago and it is a really nice tool. Recently a new release came out, called <a href="http://maemo.org/news/announcements/view/os2008_feature_upgrade-reflash_your_tablet-for_the_last_time.html">Diablo</a> and I suggest you update to that first. There is a slight problem with the Flasher for OS X in that you will have to not start flashing until your table boots with the USB sign in the top right. You get that by keeping the top button on the left side of your screen pressed and then turning it on.</p>

<p>Next up <a href="http://www.talkandroid.com/134-android-nokia-n810-install/">go to Talk Android</a> to get all the stuff you need. For those who know how to use gainroot to get root access on the device, I suggest editing their /usr/bin/android.sh with the information in <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showpost.php?p=198852&amp;amp;postcount=6">this post</a>, adding the stuff just below the &#8216;echo &quot;starting Android &#8230;&quot;&#8217; bit. Also, if you want Internet Access from within Android then you will need to log in to a nocat hotspot from within Diablo first. If you install further apps just put them in /android/system/app on the MMC card you installed android on.</p>

<p>Have fun running Android :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;This is an ongoing discussion and now Michael Arrington is at it <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/05/friendfeed-v-twitter-half-the-followers-in-five-months/">again</a>. This time it is about Friendfeed having taken 5 months for his account to have half as many friends as in twitter, where it has taken 24 months &#8230; now read again. ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Anyway, he is comparing apples with oranges, sorry Michael. Friendfeed is something totally different than Twitter. The oh so wunderful thing about Twitter is that there are NO conversations, or only short ones. That reduces the load on your own cognitive capabilities immensely. You go to twitter to hear what people are doing and possibly ask a question which is answered by a few of them. But there is not discussion forming around that one message.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Friendfeed is a simple aggregation service, and yes, it has a few nice features but at least with the current interface, there is no way to follow that conversation. I have added a lot more people than I would on twitter to Friendfeed, including you, I think, but that is only because I value your opinion and when I search for something on Friendfeed I want your opinion to be part of the answer. I will not be following live what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So these two are totally different things. I believe Twitter can become a new communication medium if they stay true to what they are doing, meaning that they are not making discussions too easy. Friendfeed might replace Google, but not Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

Just as an example, in June the German <a href="http://netzwertig.com/2008/05/30/die-cloud-kommt-dropbox-zeigt-wie-beta-invites/">Netzwertig gave it rave reviews</a> and made many people ask for an invite. One of the shortest praises <a href="http://www.simonwaldman.net/2008/06/13/whats-been-keeping-me-busy/">came from Simon Waldman</a>:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;blockquote&gt;Online storage that just works, they say…and you know what, they’re right. Beg to get on their beta list.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, that it is one of the few applications that are still running on my Macbook all the time. Simon does have some very good additional tips in that post, like Evernote and extra small Moleskins, but more on that later. Now on DropBox. I already wrote about it <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2008/04/19/a-few-items-that-clog-up-my-bookmarks/">here</a> and have now been playing with it for some time. So long actually that I was still in the beta group that got a 10GB storage box :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The application is remarkably easy to use and running seemlessly in the background, simply telling you whether it is in sync with your ownline storage or not. It also has versioning and a restore feature. I just restored a folder with 68 images because I am going to friends today and might want to check out those pics there. I have to admit that I ma not yet sure how they pay for all of this because it means you have unlimited storage when you are clever. e.g. upload 1GB movie, delete, upload another, delete, restore the old one, &#8230; you will never go above 1GB but have endless movies in there. Of course they can limit the time of the backups but still. It is a wonderful feature though and makes the entire system a lot more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Above that they have some special folders, like Photos, which will give you a gallery for all folders below that. Upload fotos in there and very easily share via a hidden folder similar to how Picasa does it. Not sure if I am totally happy with that but hey, it&#8217;s survivable and it&#8217;s your choice if you want to share fotos like that. I really do presume though that a large part of the people out there will start using DropBox to keep their PCs in Sync, and with more people using it, DropBox should install the option to find out who else is on DropBox through an address book sync, allowing me to easily share stuff with people already on there.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The bad side is just that you will otherwise need to invite somebody, who will have to install the app, and that makes it cumbersome. But if you are already using it for yourself for some time, &#8230; then it gets interesting. This is where DropBox is moving. I am using it for a long time now, and if you want an invite, I have a few left.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is really as far as it goes. Google <a href="http://gears.google.com">Gears</a>, or now Gears, as it <a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=677">de-branded</a>, makes your browser in conjunction with a web site, into an offline application, or simply an application with local components. Because it started out by simply giving your offline access to GMail or Google Reader, and now the folks behind Wordpress have announced that <a href="http://almaer.com/blog/speed-up-with-wordpress-and-gears">Wordpress 2.6 will have Gears integrated to speed up</a> the Admin Interface. Matt actually adds a few points <a href="http://ma.tt/2008/05/infrastructure-as-competitive-advantage/">here</a>, among others linking to the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/">Performance Page</a> on the Yahoo! Developer Network saying that something like 85% of the performance is in the frontend, meaning it is felt performance. This brings him on to Google Gears and how local servers will make CDNs obsolete.</p>

<p>While I do believe that there is a lot of power in Google Gears, I am not seeing yet where they will make CDNs obsolete. There is lots of stuff I do not cache or cannot cache in the browser. Above that, I know of at least one person that will scream up when you mention something like Google Gears or AIR. The thing is that these are systems that give Web Apps very deep access into your system and we just don&#8217;t have the mindset yet to really secure web applications. A simple link sent to you, might result in something loading in some un-secure AIR or Gears app and destroy your computer. This is a risk we have to deal with somehow, but I am pretty sure that is on the mind of the Google engineers and the others that are working on Gears.</p>

<p>I do fully believe Matt though that the line between servers and application is shifting in that you will less and less worry about your server infrastructure. I had a longer talk about this with the CEO from <a href="http://globalways.net">Globalways</a>, who are running a Xen virtualisation Platform.</p>

<p>But back to Gears, Techcrunch has <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/13/google-drives-towards-microsoft-and-adobe-with-gears/">a lot more interesting points</a>, e.g. that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/28/myspace-shows-facebook-how-its-done-google-gears-to-power-messaging/">Gears was implemented by MySpace for their messsaging</a>.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Today Gears supports a whole host of new features, some that it has in common with the other next generation web API efforts from Microsoft and Adobe while others are a result of their own innovation. Function calls <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gears/w/list">available to developers</a> include background processes (no more hourglass), client-side image manipulation, location-awareness, better file uploading and a local database inside the browser.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It&#8217;s really getting interesting here in that you might want to give your users the option to simply download Gears and use it and suddenly can write a lot more powerful web applications, with less servers. Looking forward to trying out the new Wordpress to see how it works with Gears.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;What a day. First <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/23/breaking-germanys-plazes-acquired-by-nokia/">Nokia bought Plazes</a> (Congrats!) and now they <a href="http://www.nokia.com/A4136001?newsid=1230415">offer to buy the remaining 52% of Symbian</a> and have <a href="http://www.nokia.com/A4136001?newsid=1230416">launched</a> the <a href="http://www.symbianfoundation.org/">Symbian Foundation</a>, which will drive the open sourcing of Symbian over the next 2 years. Of course the Symbian Foundation has wide adoption, same as the <a href="http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/">Open Handset Alliance</a> around <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a>, but we might want to dig a bit deeper to see if this is a lost cause by Nokia as Google will simply win with Android, or not.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;First to start of with one thing. Nokia sells as many phones in a few days as Apple has sold iPhones in total. So there is a bit of a market power there. Of course, Apple might be able to scale down, and Android might be nice, but there is power behind the Symbian Foundation, real power.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Another question is who is now building mobile phones. Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Samsung, Lg, Ericsson, Motorola &#8230; all members of Symbian and many of them missing from Google&#8217;s Alliance. One also has to say that these companies have real relations to carriers and real experience to get phones through testing with the FCC and others.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Also, Google lists China Mobile as part of the Open Handset Alliance, but they seem to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/23/googles-android-hits-snags-with-mobile-carriers/">have problems getting chinese working on Android</a>, and <a href="http://www.symbian.com/developer/techlib/v9.2docs/doc_source/toolsandutilities/installing-ref/pkg_format/pkg_languages_table.html">Chinese does work on Symbian obviously</a>, and with Open Sourcing the platform, there are no longer any real licensing fees and China Mobile might have an easier access route with Symbian to get their own Smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So yes, Nokia needs to build up their developer relations work to get some serious buzz around new apps for Symbian, but this is something that can be done because it is a really good base. I still want an iPhone but I will keep my N95 and I will likely get a Nokia phone again in the future. It&#8217;s just that I want back to T-Mobile anyway (reception at Base sucks some times) and the iPhone is nice indeed. It has the buzz factor at the moment. Android is too far away. And possibly Nokia will have some really compelling items out at the end of the year. And hey, just imagine them adding Plazes to a few of their phones. Give it a month and there will be more Plazes installations on phones than iPhones out there. So long Loopt. Nice to have met you.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
