  <div class="entry-content"><p>We had a relatively short DoS attack on our servers yesterday. Something like 30 minutes to one hour. Actually it was an entire class C subnet that was hit and our servers just happen to be in there. We have no idea if our servers were attack explicitely. Grrrr&#8230; These things really suck. I mean you are sitting there and there is close to nothing you can do. An entire Cisco Switch/Router broke down it seems.</p>

<p>Ah well. It&#8217;s over now and there is no realy damage. Our servers were not hit too hard and seems like the counters still worked more or less reliably even, partly to my amazement. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>See&#8230; I am already starting. If you are really into sound, then this article:</p>

<p>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58447-2001Jun12.html</p>

<p>will be a nice read.</p>

<p>Actually even if you are not it will make you wonder. But I promise you, they are right. I would currently not spend $150.000 for a hi-fi system, but I remember something from when I bought my first one.</p>

<p>I have Sony CD player and Cassette player (bad boy, bad boy! :)) and B&amp;W speakers. The main driver is a hand made Aura Evolution amp from england which just rocks. Power button, volume control, switch for CD, Cassette, Phono,&#8230; It really rocks. I loved it when I bought it and it was just the right price for me several years back.</p>

<p>But I went into the backroom of the place where I bought it and put my Living Colour CD into the main system they had there.</p>

<p>IT IS LIKE THEY SAY IN THE ARTICLE!!! You suddenly feel like the band is in the room. I heard a lot (and I mean a lot) of new sounds, effects, notes, whatever inside the song I just listened to on my system in the other room. It is totally amazing. Then again, that system cost about $30.000, so it was way out of my league, but read the article and you will understand.</p>

<p>These things are wild. Now I listen to MP3s mostly as it is easier to just mix a lot of different thigns but if I really want to listen to something deeply, I still need a CD even if it is not the same thing as an old vinyl LP.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;P&gt;Well it&#8217;s about time. I finally am coming around to posting an update. I actually told myself to do this daily but somehow always got an excuse not to or simply forgot :)</p>

<p>&lt;P&gt;What happened, hmmm&#8230; first of all my parents recently came over and stayed in a very nice hotel here in Aachen. The cool thing is that you had a wireless keyboard for the TV and could surf on there. This is of course nice but nothing I did not imagine before, and for close to 4 EUR for 15 minutes or something, the hotel will make good money on it too :)</p>

<p>&lt;P&gt;The cool thing though was that you can play Playstation games on the TV too. This includes a nice warning message when you want to do it telling you that if you have problems with flashing lights, fast movement and finger movement on close spaced you should not be doing it. 7 EUR per 30 minutes :) Just imagine the bill if parents leave their kids alone in the room for too long :)</p>

<p>&lt;P&gt;Next to that I have been to the belgium cost for a few days which was really nice. We just caught the very good weather for the 4 days that we were there and got a really good sunburn. It&#8217;s strange, but it seems that you even at close to 26 I still did not learn that put on sunlotion is a good thing.</p>

<p>&lt;P&gt;We also had a very nice birthday party in cologne where I took some really nice shots with the digicam, 78 of those to be exact. I love this camera. I mean it is so much easier to just take a few pictures and you do not need to worry about the costs of developing the film. Very neat. And I learned a long time ago that I just want to take shots of people rather than some nice landscape shots. I did some artsy photography some time ago with lots of different cameras but by now I just want a camera that is small and that lets me take shots I will remember whereever I am.</p>

<p>&lt;P&gt;Other than that there is not really a lot to talk about. Live is going good, I like IMAP, got a new electrical tooth brush for getting the Deutsche Bank a new customer, its 5 am gain today and I am up way to long, met a very very nice people over the last few days that were very interesting to talk to, did a good TMA on my MBA course, still do not have my latest test results, started writing some nice articles, had a great welcomeback-birthday party for my brother, still would like to work in some foreign country, feel intrigued by the entire concept behind the Chaordic Age, thinking about getting an MP3 player, saw a nice way-to-expensive watch, thinking about getting a new laptop, loving life, feeling good, feet hurt due to party, need to go to bed, thinking about doing that now, stopping posting is a good idea, so that&#8217;s that. I will see if I can do a bit more frequent updates which will be a lot more fun too :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to Adrian I have just done another personality test.</p>

<p>I already read a book on personality reading recently and it turns out there that my type is <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/psychology/alt.psychology.personality/profiles/enfp.html">ENFP</a>. I have to say that it fits quite well. There are still some things missing but in general it is really good.</p>

<p>The new test can be found <a href="http://www.duniho.com/fergus/enneagram/test/">here</a>. The author points out that it is just something to try out but use with a grain of salt. You cannot really make out a type that easily. There were some answeres where I just did not totally know what I should answer to fully describe my thoughts and feelings to this answer, but this is always the problem with questionaires. Anyway. Read on for my result and explenations. I scored as a Two by the way.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;P&gt;I scored as a Two.</p>

<p>&lt;P&gt;Below is a breakdown of your scores, ordered from highest to lowest.  To quote them: &lt;I&gt;If you are not the type you scored highest as, you might be one of the types you scored next highest as.  The highest possible score is 28, and the lowest is 0.  On your right is the breakdown of how many questions you answered in favor of each triad group.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;P&gt;The interesting thing is that I might not agree with some of the things in the right table, but I do agree with the type explenation more or less. Interesting to say the least.</p>

<p>&lt;P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;TABLE BORDER=&quot;3&quot; CELLPADDING=&quot;3&quot; CELLSPACING=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH&gt;Type&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TH&gt;Score&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH&gt;Two&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TD&gt;13&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH&gt;Seven&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TD&gt;12&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH&gt;Nine&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TD&gt;11&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH&gt;Three&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TD&gt;10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH&gt;Five&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TD&gt;9&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH&gt;One&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TD&gt;8&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH&gt;Eight&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TD&gt;8&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH&gt;Four&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TD&gt;7&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH&gt;Six&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TD&gt;6&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot; ALIGN=&quot;RIGHT&quot;&gt;
&lt;TABLE BORDER=&quot;3&quot; CELLPADDING=&quot;3&quot; CELLSPACING=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH COLSPAN=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Preferred Intelligence Triad&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TH COLSPAN=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Hierarchical Styles Triad&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Behavioral - 891&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Control - 258&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;3&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Emotional - 234&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;3&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Harmony - 369&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Mental - 567&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Ideals - 147&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD COLSPAN=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH COLSPAN=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Coping Styles Triad&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TH COLSPAN=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Social Styles Triad&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Positive - 792&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;5&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Assertive - 378&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;3&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Competency - 135&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Compliant - 126&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Reactive - 468&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Withdrawn - 459&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;P&gt;Now on for some explenations. First of all. Regard all this with skepticism if you do it. I still do and partly do not agree, but it is interesting to say the least. But here is what a Two type is like.</p>

<p>&lt;TABLE BORDER=&quot;3&quot; CELLSPACING=&quot;0&quot; CELLPADDING=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH&gt;Primary Intelligence:&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Emotional&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH&gt;Coping Style:&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Positive&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH&gt;Social Style:&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Compliant&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH&gt;Hierarchical Style:&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Control&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Twos try to retain control over their lives by using their strong emotional intelligence to anticipate and meet (comply to) the needs of others.  By making themselves indispensible, Twos feel that they can assure themselves a place in others&#8217; lives.  They also use their emotional intelligence to keep a positive outlook on life, which helps to spare them from the pain they would otherwise feel by being so in touch with other people&#8217;s needs and emotions.  Without keeping a positive outlook, Twos would sink into the pain of those they feel compassion for.  At their best, Twos provide great service to those in need.  Mother Theresa is a good example.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;P&gt;Meet Mother Theresa 2 ;) Well not quite I think. :)</p>

<p>&lt;P&gt;A list of all the types can be seen <a href="http://www.9points.com/types.htm">here</a>. I really think you should read that as it is really interesting and I have to say that my type is probably a mix of the ones with the higher marks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow. I just watched <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0152930">Taxi</a>. Very cool movie I have to say. I mean the story is a little bit flawed but if you want to see some really amazing car racing then <em>watch</em> <em>that</em> <em>movie</em>!</p>

<p>They even had the problem of getting this filmed because the film is not running faster or something. They are really driving that fast in the city! :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now I know what Mathematicians do all day. This is what I received today.</p>

<p>First we state that girls require time and money:</p>

<p>Girls = Time x Money</p>

<p>As we all know &quot;time is money&quot;:</p>

<p>Time = Money</p>

<p>Therefor:</p>

<p>Girls = Money x Money = (Money) ^ 2</p>

<p>And because &quot;money is the root of all evil&quot;:</p>

<p>Money = Squareroot(Evil)</p>

<p>Therefor:</p>

<p>Girls = ( Squareroot(Evil) ) ^ 2</p>

<p>And we are forced to conclude that:</p>

<p>Girls = Evil</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally we have good weather. It is getting warm in Germany and I like it. Already got a new haircut and finally made the move. I bought <a href="http://www.oakley.com/cda/3.0/1,1676,49-MA1-1-8-30,00.html">new glasses</a>. Oakley a Wire thick, with black prescription glasses. God these prescription glasses make these things expensive. But Oakley are the only ones that can give you glasses with the same looks as without prescription. Otherwise you would get these weird brown or green colors only. Sadly it will not take 4 weeks for the set to arrive. The good weather will probably be over by then ;)</p>

<p>php coding is getting more fun I have to say. Once you get the hang of it you see what can be done and I might even start liking coding :) It is a real good stretch for the brain and the perfect counter ballance to the MBA studies, where I have to think about communicating with people at the moment and how the same event is interpreted differently by different people. Nothing ground braking really but I presume that this is exactly the problem for the later test. I just think it is easy but it isn&#8217;t. I will see what the others think, whom I will be meeting again this Saturday in Brussels.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok. We had them build a stage yesterday, emm&#8230; rather, we saw them do it. Right in  front of our windows. We knew something was happening tomorrow (now  today) 1st of May.</p>

<p>We just ignored it for now. But then it started going. Moving into 1st of May is already a big party in Aachen. I learned more PHP all evening which was growing great. Went to sleep around 3 am and at 5 am sleep for temporarily over. Some freaks were banging on drums and playing guitar in front of our window. First I did not really notice it and in a state of half sleep I tried to match the drumming in some while loop or case statements. Hmmm&#8230; I might have overdone it with PHP last evening :)</p>

<p>Anyway. They finally stopped (after I tried to NOT put them in a while loop and kind of failed both in putting them in and not doing it) and I got some sleep.</p>

<p>But around 9 am they started testing the audio system in front of our window with the same song over and over and over and over again. Grrr&#8230; so much for sleep this night. There is really no way you can sleep, or almost, as it is <em>really</em> loud.</p>

<p>If you want to see what is going on here today, go <a href="http://oliver.thylmann.com/photos-public/index.php?dir=20010501-unwanted_party_on_my_lawn">here</a>. I will update this throughout the day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just submitted my Second TMA to the OU. That one was a lot harder to write then the first one but I think that I did ok. Some of the parts are better and others worse. But that is just how it is :) The first one got me 77 of 100 points, which seems to be very good, as you are really only going over 85% very rarely. 100 is not achievable as they would ask something like &quot;ok, this guy has been perfect right? Nothing that could be improved? No better wording or other idea that could be introduced somewhere?&quot;.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I have not posted a lot in the last few days. Well I have been very busy. Seems like our server from Dell should be done soon and I also have the tax stuff settled. Seems like you can import servers in the US without a problem and only need to pay a 0.21% handling fee, which is ok really. The server will be send to brussels and I will pick it up there and bring it here. Might be an idea to set it up in our place I figure rather than over in the US. We will see.</p>

<p>The other thing is that I have installed FreeBSD on my desktop and I must say that I really like it. KDE2 is looking rather nice. But then I tried using drag and drop to play an MP3 file with x11amp. Boy does BeOS get you spoiled :)</p>

<p>I had the idea that a ports section like in FreeBSD would be a great thing for BeOS. That would really rock. Just get apache installed and php4 and mysql, have a few depends there and you are ready to rock. Just update that with the help of BeBits each day and people can update that section also. Then they can just automatically be queried for action if some software is updated. Would be really cool. I think we need BONE so we can run httpd and php4 and mysql or something as this would really rock. I just like having that on my box. Hmmm&#8230;</p>

<p>Well I need to get ready for a birthday party today, so see you all soon and have a great day everyone, life rocks.</p>
