  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here the focus is on the market choice within Piercy&#8217;s pathway to customer orientation, which also includes the value proposition and key relationships which are not discussed here.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<ol>
<li>Market choices
This involves Philip Kotler&#8217;s exchange process, in which you need to know who your customers are and to motivate them to buy, and Millman&#8217;s six markets model, which helps identifying your different customers, often linked to each other, as well as their wants and needs.</li>
</ol>


<p>The markets are:
- Recruitments
- Supplier
- Internal
- Customer
- Referral
- Influence</p>

<p>Customer buying behaviour is &quot;the decision processes and acts of individuals involved in buying and using products and services.&quot; (Dibb, 1997)</p>

<ul>
<li>Buyer reactions to products are important</li>
<li>understand influences</li>
<li>using segments</li>
<li>understanding behaviour helps predict future</li>
</ul>


<p>Lancaster and Massingham proposed a framework for understanding customers and said there are three areas to take into account:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Customers as Individuals
You need to know about things like experience, learning style, personality, lifestyle and stage in their life cycle as well as the resulting characteristics important for their buying behaviour. (See book 14 page 13)</p></li>
<li><p>Customer as a decision maker
The decision making process evolves around: need recognition, information search, evaluation, buying decision, post-purchase evaluation.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>An important thing to remember is External Stimuli which can be influenced by the individual, information search, culture, marketing and the environment. This will move to problem recognition. All the steps from there are deeply influenced by individual and cultural influences.</p>

<p>This process is especially apparent in high risk purchases. High-credence services (doctor, dentist, financial services, &#8230;) are an item where you will not have full knowledge. You need to trust that the service you get will fulfil you need.
In the information search this will make personal things like word-of-mouth become more important.
You might have an easier time switching between services which might put the evaluation elsewhere in the process and post-purchase evaluation becomes more important.</p>

<p>High-involvement decisions will rely on more people and are influenced by the extent of decision making and degree of involvement.
- Inertia: more of a habit and low involvement, you just buy as it is not worth the trouble for something else.
- Brand loyalty: again a habit thing but with high involvement in the purchase, possible more of trust than habit
- Limited decision making: high decision making but low involvement because of low risk purchase
- Complex decision making: everything high, like house or car or holiday</p>

<p>Businesses to business decisions are often risky and a good relationship between buyer and seller is needed to reduce the perceived risk.</p>

<ol>
<li>Customers as members of (sub-) cultures
Defined as the sum of all learned beliefs, values and customs. Different countries eat different amounts of pasta for example.</li>
</ol>


<p>From that knowledge you need to move on to market segmentation, used to divide the market in easily targeted groups. There are different segments and variables but understanding the common characteristics that help you group potential customers based on your knowledge about them, is crucial for a correct strategy.</p>

<p>To target segments you can do so:
- Undifferentiated
- differentiated
- Concentrated
- customized</p>

<p>You should also look at choosing segments in which you can keep customers long term. On top of that one-to-one customization becomes more important as it also becomes possible.</p>

<p>You also need to take into account how your customers affect you, e.g. loud guests in a restaurant targeted at fine dining.</p>

<p>If you know all of the above, then you need to think about positioning. Your company for your customers to be able to be aware of the differences between you and your competitors.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This goes from very loose to narrow performance-pay focussed. Either you move with formal systems or you facilitate performance in interpersonal ways meaning that you do it without measurement.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>In possible definition evolves around a shared vision of purpose and aims which in the end enhance the performance of both individual and organisation. (Fletcher, 1993)</p>

<p>As of Fletcher there are three key elements:
- setting of clear objectives
- Formal monitoring and review
- use to reinforce desired behaviour</p>

<p>All this needs to be horizontally (performance management) and vertically (fit company with individual) integration.</p>

<p>Go from corporation strategy to department purpose analysis. This affects individual objective setting, performance evaluation and then reward and development.</p>

<p>Performance management should work at all of those levels. A more advanced system can be seen in book 13 at page 13.</p>

<p>There are different parts within this performance management cycle.</p>

<ol>
<li>Setting and agreeing on objectives
Communication is key and objectives can be both targets and tasks. Influences include:</li>
<li>Corporate goals</li>
<li>Senior management goals</li>
<li>Department/functional goals</li>
<li>Team goals</li>
<li>Individual goals</li>
</ol>


<p>They should be SMART</p>

<p>Problems:
- Too tightly specified tasks
- Most important objectives not measurable
- Agreement is difficult
- What is seen as realistic varies
- They are time bound</p>

<p>They should also be consistent and agreed objectives are often more effective. They should also try to achieve the upper goal (e.g. individual goals should help achieve team goals)</p>

<ol>
<li>Performance review
To be good this often entails:</li>
<li>Assessment against agreed targets and standards</li>
<li>Constructive feedback on accurate info</li>
<li>use positive reinforcement</li>
<li>achieve joint agreement on future things to do</li>
</ol>


<p>There are different kinds of methods to use:
- rating (Semco)
- comparing achievements with objectives
- Critical incident method (file incidents during the year)
- Narrative report
- Behaviourally anchored rating scale (custom-built characteristics for job to rate it)</p>

<p>A newer approach would be 360-degree feedback where assessments are sought from a variety of people (co-workers, subordinates, internal customers, suppliers, manager, external customers) to remove the bias or imperfections from a review by just one person. Sometimes questionnaires are adapted especially for the targeted stakeholder group.</p>

<ol>
<li>Measuring performance</li>
</ol>


<p>While what gets measured gets done, it is important to remember that:
- The act of measuring needs to cost less than the result achieved brings in
- Too much data is bad</p>

<p>Why: to see problems and correct them and see if the correction is working
What: becomes difficult in people management especially where no direct output</p>

<p>Currently we are moving to measuring a bigger set of data to have a well rounded view (EFQM, Six Sigma, and Balanced Scorecard) but linking this to individual performance is hard.</p>

<p>To link pay to performance is thought to be the solution of performance management but it gets complicated. For one, the link between performance and pay needs to be very clear. It might also be bad for team work and needs to be big enough to make a meaningful difference.</p>

<p>EVA (Economic Value Added) method is currently used to align management with long term shareholder wants and needs.</p>

<p>In general performance based pay works better in smaller organisations as things are easier to measure.</p>

<p>Many times performance management comes from the accounting side and neglects the personal aspect. Other methods of managing performance would include individual coaching and counselling.</p>

<p>Different coaching styles include The Judge (tough), The Helper (Protective), The Thinker (Calculator), The Fun Lover (Whoopee) and The Defendant (Manipulative).</p>

<p>Remember:
- can make vital contribution
- Different approaches work at different times in different places
- Employee needs to be committed to the enterprise.</p>

<time datetime="2003-05-05T09:23:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 5<span>th</span>, 2003</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Between a company and an employee there are three kinds of contracts.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The formal contract
Setting out the formal right and obligations of the employee often within the local legislation. Includes things like salary, holiday, work hours, place of work, title,&#8230;</p></li>
<li><p>The informal contract
More or less explicit like work objectives and if you should stay until a job is done even if this is longer than working hours.</p></li>
<li><p>The psychological contract
This includes the expectations set forth by the above contracts as well as the wider picture, unspoken expectations. These might be taken for granted, only seen when they are broken or hard to discuss.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>What employees see as more and more important is that they have to believe that they are treated fairly. There are several parts here.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Distributive fairness
Or fairness of outcomes like rate of pay, appraisal score, promoting decision. These outcomes are mostly linked to a comparison group for us.</p></li>
<li><p>Procedural fairness
This looks as processes, like the process of making a pay decision, or the appraisal system as such.</p></li>
<li><p>Interactional fairness
How are you treated in your interactions with others? The extend to which we are treated with respect and accorded dignity.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>If mixtures of these are believed to be unfair then retaliatory action might be taken by the employee.</p>

<p>The same way, a perception of fairness increases commitment.</p>

<p>There are some universal points that are important if you look at fairness:
- Choice
- Voice
- Explanation
- Good interpersonal treatment</p>

<p>Another important thing is the commitment that the employee needs to have to the company. Continuance commitment (leading to greater willingness to stay but possibly less performance) would be commitment due to lack of alternatives or high costs of leaving (e.g. stock options) or there is affective commitment (leading to higher performance) because they identify with (parts) of the company and its goals.</p>

<p>Affective commitment can be managed by communicating job security, high fairness, interesting and challenging jobs, good value fit, making contributions important.</p>

<p>(Book 12 page 21 more info)</p>

<p>Measuring this is hard but happening more often. See page 22 book 12 for example questions (strongly agree to disagree).</p>

<p>The implications of this are are split up in categories:</p>

<p>Human resource flow:
- Recruitment and selection to fit company and making it fair to maintain good attitude towards company even for those who are not accepted. This means selection processes need to be perceived as fair.
- Internal staffing and promotion needs to happen with decision makers who are trusted not to have favourites, clear and open decision criteria, your option to talk, an explanation, respectful treatment.
- Induction and socialisation needs to help get employee and company goals in line.
- Managing exit needs to happen fair too both with people leaving on their own and being let go who might work with suppliers,&#8230;</p>

<p>Performance Management
- Appraisal needs to be promised and done, on appropriate criteria, with a fair rating format and more
- Rewards</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This will be about the value proposition that your company has based on the relationships with your competitors, customers, collaborators and co-workers.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>To analyse financials you need to look at things like variances, a so called Variance analysis which will include both price (Ho much more money spent due to higher price) and quantity (How much more money spent due to more products at budget price) variance.</p>

<p>Variance = Planned result - Actual result = (Budgeted quantity x Budgeted price) - (Actual quantity x Actual price) = [(Budgeted quantity - Actual quantity) x Budgeted price] + [Actual quantity x (Budget price - Actual price)] = Quantity variance + Price variance</p>

<p>When calculating a variance you need to split it up in ways that will increase your understanding and that it can help you answer the &quot;Why?” The variance should be easily explainable to be most useful.</p>

<p>When this budget moves over different departments you need to work on co-operation no matter if you are on target or not in your budget as otherwise they will work against each other.</p>

<p>If you look at outsourcing or not you will need to look at what part of the money you spend will really flow out of the company to get the full picture. In pricing deals that might be outsourced there are several methods which are called transfer pricing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Market based transfer pricing</li>
<li>Cost based transfer pricing
concerns: I) only marginal costs to be used as unavoidable costs would continue when outsouced; ii) does not make profit centres; iii) when capacity limit no real world link</li>
<li>Negotiated transfer prices (net realisable value = product revenue - additional costs needed)</li>
<li>administered transfer prices</li>
</ul>


<p>If you look at financial information then you need to have enough information to make a good decision. You should have actual and budget figure as well as this from different periods. You need the full picture.</p>

<p>If something is loosing you money then you need to look at:</p>

<ol>
<li>The sales you loose</li>
<li>The gross profit you loose if you can remove the costs of the goods sold</li>
<li>You need to reduce the overheads by the amount of gross profit next</li>
<li>Then you need to reduce the overheads some more if the product got charged more than the gross profit.</li>
</ol>


<p>You will need to look at what are joint costs and what will fall away.</p>

<p>Just looking at the bottom line is just not enough.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This booklet included three different examples where poor performance resulted from inadequate control or control failures, which again is often the result of uncontrolled growth.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Case Study 1</p>

<p>A purchasing officer has budgeted price for the things she can buy but upon a request by a sales manager she bought extra items at a higher price to help the sales manager please the very important customer. In her performance report this got neglected and she was just told that she was above budget. In reality the company still made a good profit on the things she bought.</p>

<p>This is typical for the important balance between subordinates having enough flexibility to respond to customer and superiors having sufficient influence to safeguard the organisation.</p>

<p>Managers are often risk averse to hold their position.</p>

<p>When analysing the accounting in a company look at:
- How accounting highlights some and downplays other actions and consequences.
- How accounting reflects, reinforces and initiates hierarchical structures.
- How accounting operates vertically to help the powerful monitor and assess the less powerful.</p>

<p>You need a good balance between the freedom, creativity and initiative versus preventing the risk margin to break.</p>

<p>Case Study 2</p>

<p>In a factory tight budgets are introduced and if met, made even tighter again which resulted in difficulties between departments that try to meet their budget rather than work together efficiently.</p>

<p>Pay attention to:
- setting unreachable targets
- Lack of consultation over targets
- Punitive treatment of adverse variance
- holding subordinates responsible for matters that they cannot control
- assuming co-ordination problems will take care of themselves if departmental targets are met</p>

<p>An organisation chart would describe it at the Blameless on top, followed by several Scapegoats who again have Suckers under them.</p>

<p>The challenge is to manage the interactions to ensure they are as positive as possible.</p>

<p>Case Study 3</p>

<p>This one is about managing a small business.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes credit sales and debtors control is not good enough and a credit worthiness check-up is not done.</li>
<li>Not creditworthy with suppliers yet.</li>
<li>lack of operating information, no basic criteria or budget what to accept or how to optimally use the machines</li>
<li>No cash flow control to help make proper use of overdraft facilities and possible longer term loans</li>
<li>Lack of programming of developments or of project planning</li>
<li>Lack of strategic plan, something in the mind that guides the way you develop your business over the long term</li>
</ul>


<p>You need to look at your functions and transactions (Marketing, Production, Payroll, Stock, Debtors, Creditors, R&amp;D, and Distribution) which are your operating information, move from there to task/operating control on to management control and from there to strategy formulation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This needs feedback on the action taken and back. It requires a problem definition, a decision maker and a feedback loop.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Implicit here would be that there is data available about goals to create this feedback loop and have measurements in place (balancing loop). This is often called negative feedback because you convey information on how it is not desired.</p>

<p>Positive information would lead to more of whatever is going on which now includes a vicious and virtuous cycle (compound interest).</p>

<p>Positive = responding to change
Negative = maintaining control and stability</p>

<p>You need to remember that there might be a delay in both information delivery and action taken. This can lead to overshooting (interest rates lowered to fast) or oscillation (adjust water temperature). This delay needs to be minimized to make the process manageable.</p>

<p>Defining the information requirements requires knowing what is needed when, where and by whom.</p>

<p>Generic types of information:
- Internally generated and externally gathered
- Formal or informal
- Ad hoc or regular
- Human, textual, electronic
- Degree of subjectivity</p>

<p>The problem is to balance external focus and internal control (e.g. car)</p>

<p>In deploying IT you should focus on what those who will be using it need rather than what the technology can do. A good approach is critical success factors.</p>

<p>The critical success factor method focuses on individual managers and on each manager’s current information needs both hard and soft. It provides for identifying managerial information in a clear and meaningful way. Moreover, it takes into consideration the fact that information needs will vary from manager to manager and that these needs will change with time for a particular manager. - Rockart. 1979</p>

<p>They are the few key areas where things must go right for the organisation to flourish. Rockart believed that there are usually three or sex and they are closely linked to organisational goals.</p>

<p>You go from Identifying critical success factors (CSF) which identify key decisions (KD) related to these factors. Then you identify information requirements (IR) for those key decisions.</p>

<p>In assessing performance Sears noticed that there is a chain of cause and effect running from employee behaviour to customer behaviour to profits and all this depends largely on attitude which, for the employees, is a mix between attitude about the job and attitude about the company.</p>

<p>The performance of the information itself might be judged by quality criteria (relevance, reliability, robustness).</p>

<p>The performance can be judged by looking at the process (gathering, analysing, communicating and storing) and looking at possibly gaps to the optimum. A gap analysis can work with the help of a critical success factor system first looking at expectations and then at perceptions.</p>

<p>The most relevant forms of power here is resource power and position power as information is increasingly seen as a valuable resource and you might be in a position to influence the flow of power.  IT will affect the power balance at all levels.</p>

<p>Davenport et al suggest 5 models</p>

<p>Technocratic utopianism
Technology approach dominates but not technology can convince sharing if it is not wanted.
Anarchy
More centralised approaches brake down or no key executive has seen the importance
Feudalism
Most often encountered; individual execs and departments control acquisition, storage, distribution and analysis. Leads to fragmenting; flourishes in places with strong divisional authority.
Monarchy
Most practical, CEO dictates strategy
Federalism
Preferred model, use of negotiation to bring potentially competing and non cooperating parties together.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>IT systems will not make all the company internal information available. This means IT will not replace other means of exchanging information but just enhances it.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Information can most fittingly be defined as something that the receiver knows or would like to know.</p>

<p>Codified information is easily expressed but tacit knowledge requires experience, judgement, knack, wisdom and intuition.</p>

<p>University of Bath defines information management as:
The conscious process by which information is gathered and used to assist in decision making at all levels of an organisation.</p>

<p>This is a conscious process to assist decision making, should start with the planning process and keep the decisions to be made in mind.</p>

<p>Dimensions:
Formal - informal
Textual - pictorial
Quantitative - qualitative
Verbal - paper - electronic
Individual - aggregated</p>

<p>Information is difficult to count, who owns it and how valuable is information =&gt; hard to cost.</p>

<p>Information quality can be judged by:
- Relevance: the recipient is able to use it to perform more efficiently than would be possible without it.
- Reliability: timely, accurate, and verifiable
- Robustness: can stand up to the rigours of time, human frailty, system failure and organizational changes.</p>

<p>A Problem might be that information is poorly gathered, too little, wrong or too much.</p>

<p>To plan information gathering look at:
- Accountability
- Data definition
- Standardisation
- Quality monitoring
- Skills</p>

<p>Analysing information can be said to make the raw data meaningful. But beyond that the transformation from information to knowledge is about integrating information into the framework of knowledge already possessed by the decision maker or company as a whole.</p>

<p>Communication involves a process (Formulate -&gt; Transmit -&gt; Receive -&gt; Interpret) which involves what to say, to whom and how to say it. The more focussed this is the more likely it is to be received and made useful. Successful reception is crucial.</p>

<p>Storing information is important as otherwise it is gathered, used and forgotten. You need to look at:
- The form in which it is originally obtained
- Volume
- Who needs to have access?
- How long to keep it
- What kind of protection necessary</p>

<p>There are also structural factors to take into account:</p>

<p>Policies, procedures and standards
Information management functions are there to ensure that all these are reviewed and adapted regularly.</p>

<p>Work organisation
How to allocate responsibility and work for carrying out the tasks needed.</p>

<p>System, equipment and materials
Need to be appropriate and need to be designed for ease, speed and accuracy of use.</p>

<p>Training
Routing on the job training most effective</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;You need to take multiple perspectives into account. Finally, we can only really understand how these different perspectives work together if we understand the strategic goals of an organisation. We need to consider how each perspective contributions to the achievement of strategic goals. The balanced scorecard helps here.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>What you measure is what you get and no single measure can provide a clear performance target or focus attention on the critical areas of the business. Managers want a balanced presentation of both financial and operational measures.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The balanced scorecard includes financial measures that tell the result of actions already taken together with operational measures on customer satisfaction, internal processes and the organization&#8217;s innovation and improvement activities - operation measures that are drivers of future financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You need to answer four basic questions:
1. How do customers see us? (Customer perspective)
2. What must we excel at? (Internal perspective)
3. Can we continue to improve and create value? (Innovation and learning perspective)
4. How do we look to shareholders? (Financial perspective)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The scorecard brings together seemingly disparate elements of a company&#8217;s competitive agenda and it guards against sub-optimzation.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translate your general mission statement on customer service in specific measures that reflect the factors that really matter to customers. Normally: time, quality, performance, service and cost. Look at things from the customers&#8217; eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;These should stem form the business processes that have the greatest impact on customer satisfaction - factors that affect cycle time, quality, employee skills and productivity for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company&#8217;s ability to innovate, improve and learn ties directly to the company&#8217;s value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;These measures indicate whether the company&#8217;s strategy, implementation and execution are contributing to the bottom line. This can actually enhance the QM program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The disparity between improved operational performance and disappointing financial measures creates frustration for senior executives. If the strategy as translated to measurable objectives by the balanced scorecard does not provide for a financial return then the strategy needs to be rethought. The balanced scorecard puts strategy not control at the centre.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Remember that everything is interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are three perspectives to accounting. The technical-rational (what you should do in general), institutional (the image your give of yourself) and the socio-political (to get power).</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>The management control function sits between the operational/task control and strategic planning/strategy formulation. Managers are called upon to be both planners and controllers.</p>

<p>Operational control entails:
- establishing and maintaining accounts and records
- Financial supervision and control
- safeguarding
- Engaging, training and allocating staff
And
- ensuring activities are orderly and secure
- prevent swindle, stealing, &#8230;
- Record transactions with few errors as possible</p>

<p>This information is then further processed, analyzed and aggregated to provide information for management control.</p>

<p>Management control focuses on implementing strategies and achieving goals across and organization, is systematic, requires people to analyze, evaluate and interact and depends on operating information. There are 4 systems to controlling business strategy at your disposal:
- Beliefs system (control of core values)
- Interactive control systems (control of strategic uncertainties)
- Boundary system (risks to be avoided)
- Diagnostic control system (Critical performance variables)</p>

<p>In general you need also information and the broader your horizon becomes the more your measures will be financial. Trust is important and an information system is good if it supports you, it needs to be fit for the task.</p>

<p>It is generally expected that information of task control type comes from within, is routine and a mix of informal and information and the further you move to strategic planning you will need outside information in ad hoc ways. Task control information is usually quite detailed, specific and accurate; strategic planning data are more aggregated and rough and ready. Management control falls between the two.</p>

<p>The following is the management control process. It is a circle, never ending.</p>

<ol>
<li>Reporting and analysis, possibly with external information. You also need to consider strategies, possibly new ones.</li>
<li>These are fed back into the programming (possibly external info)</li>
<li>You move on to Budgeting (again with external info) and this might be revised from stage 1</li>
<li>Operating and measurement comes next (again external info possible) and here action might be needed from 1.</li>
</ol>


<p>Management control structures often rely on a chain of accountability which is primarily vertical. At each stage the top person gives specification of performance and the person below gives back information on performance.</p>

<p>You can also be allocating responsibility and authority using accounting and a separate budget might reflect the boundary of the manager&#8217;s financial authority. These responsibility centres are sometimes called cost centres.</p>

<ol>
<li>Discretionary expense centres
Fixed amount of money to spend during a financial period. Checked at intervals.</li>
<li>Standard expense centres
expected to produce or handle a product. comparing actual costs with the standard costs multiplied by volume</li>
<li>Revenue centres
revenue target set</li>
<li>Profit centres
either a profit target or a deficit limit</li>
<li>Investment centres
Here the centre is dealt with like a separate business, taking care of investment and return on investment (or capital) = responsibility centre profit / net assets employed.</li>
</ol>


<p>Management control systems are only effective if they influence behaviour. Only when managers understand how these systems influence the behaviour of their subordinates and what trade-offs occur in each control strategy can they learn to use organizational control systems effectively. Remember:
1. Measurement indicates what is important.
2. Subordinates tend to put energy into measured areas.
3. If this performance is improving this can be a source for personal satisfaction</p>

<p>Subordinates also put their effort into &quot;game playing&quot; and &quot;beat the system&quot;, set low goals that can be easily met, manipulate measures or sabotage the system.</p>

<p>There are two approaches:</p>

<p>External control: motivated primarily by external rewards and need to be controlled. The goal is to stretch subordinates and leave little room for slack. These measures need to be set up so that they cannot be manipulated. Rewards need to be directly and openly tied to performance. But people might try to improve their performance measures but not create any commitment to their doing a better job, other measures might also be important. They might also try to reduce the flow of valid information and use excessive caution.</p>

<p>Internal motivation: Subordinates can be motivated by building their commitments to organizational goals and by their being involved and these goals are set anticipatively and set up for joint problem identification and solution. The system is used as an &quot;early warning&quot; function because you work closely together. Rewards are tied to performance but not specific measures but rather tied to the entire job performance. This gives subordinates little incentive for playing games or to behave dysfunctional. Because there is less control there might be lower targets and the system becomes difficult to use as a basis for giving rewards. Some individuals might not respond to the system.</p>

<p>For choosing an approach you need to look at:
1. Consistency between strategy choice and managerial style
2. Organizational climate, structure, and reward system
3. Reliability of job performance measures
4. Individual differences among subordinates</p>

<p>An informed choice can be made using the decision-tree approach (Study Guide page 73).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The definition used in this book is: Human resource management concerns all management decisions and actions that affect the relationship between an organization and its members.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>There are many potential frameworks and one divides HRM into:
- Human resource flow: the flow of people into, through and out of the organization
- Performance management: how to control, monitor and motivate employees; needs a clearly understood and commonly shared set of goals
- Work design: the way in which work is structured and organized</p>

<p>Job content is affected by the task technology, people and their skills, management policies and practice as well as supervision and management style.</p>

<p>There are different work system like a Control-based work system (narrowly defined jobs, specialization, pay for specific job, close supervision, almost no employee involvement, &#8230;) and Commitment-based work system (broadly defined jobs, rotation of employees through jobs/-multi-skilling, pay by skills mastered, self or peer supervision, high level of involvement, &#8230; example. Nokia)</p>

<ul>
<li>Employee involvement: Representative involvement (e.g. trade union, consultative committee,&#8230;) or direct employee involvement (either involvement in the work itself or systems for directly informing and listening to employees like surveys or meetings).</li>
</ul>


<p>And effective HR policy and practices can have an important effect on organizational performance.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cost-effective: HR policy in terms of costs and benefits even though these benefits are harder to measure</li>
<li>Building human capital: employees are resources to be invested in and performance can be judged by looking whether they attract, keep and develop people. A competitive advantage increasingly rests on organizations&#8217; ability to develop and retain their human capital.</li>
<li>Commitment and motivation: whether human resource policies and practice effectively motivate employees and secure their commitment to the organization and its goal.</li>
<li>Goal congruence: the extent to which human resource policy and practice generate a common purpose among organization members.</li>
<li>Ethical acceptability: social standards of fair treatment are enshrined in law; widely held standards of ethical behaviour</li>
</ul>


<p>You need to look at HR from all stakeholders eyes.</p>

<p>HRM does not exist in a vacuum but is influenced by:
- Labour market: depends on their reputation as an employer and the benefits they can offer
- Task technology: the nature of the technology used for principal organizational tasks will have a significant effect on the way people are organized and managed.
- Law and society
- Trade union
- Strategic goals: to be effective, HR policies need to fit the strategic goals and environment of the organization.
- Organization culture: one important part is the assumptions and values about how people should be treated and managed
- Leadership</p>
