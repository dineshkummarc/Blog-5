  <div class="entry-content"><p>The biggest (I think) mail order company in Germany <a href="http://www.quelle.de/">Quelle</a>, is selling several <a href="http://www.smart.de/">Smart</a> cars. Yes, cars. You order them, and DHL (owned by Deutsche Post) will ship it to you ;). The german new story is &lt;a title=&quot;News &amp; Wetter | Wirtschaft | MSN | FOCUS Online | FOCUS Online | News&quot; href=&quot;http://news.focus.msn.de/G/GN/gn.htm?snr=118618&amp;streamsnr=8&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. DaimlerChrysler, who build the Smart, are supporting it (no shit! ;)). I have to say though that I rather think that this is some brilliant form of guerillia marketing instead of simple sales. That doesn&#8217;t make it any less brilliant of course ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This again is only a summary of the terms used in the Managing Customers and Quality part of the course.</p>

<p>Customers v. Consumers v. Stakeholders</p>

<p>Customers are those who buy your products while consumers are those who use it (e.g. Pet food, Public Services).</p>

<p>Stakeholders are those who have an interest in an organisation and can affect or be affected by it.</p>

<p>&quot;A central task of top management is reconciling these deverging and partly conflicting interests.</p>

<p>Decision Making Process and Influences</p>

<p>A logical sequence of steps people may go through to make a decision.</p>

<ol>
<li>Problem Recognition: See a problem or need. The company cannot do a lot to influence this (exept possibly Advertising)</li>
<li>Information Search: How can it be solved. The company should make this info available.</li>
<li>Information Evaluation: To destinguish product 1 and 2. This of this as a series of filters like friends and other resources.</li>
<li>Decision: Filtered and matched against criteria and possibly with adding new criteria based on the products found.</li>
<li>Post-purchase-evaluation: Here you are trying to convine yourself that the decision is right and it does live up to expectations. This is something that the automotive industry is trying to do with ads.</li>
</ol>


<p>In problem solving there are different modes:
- routine problem solving: e.g. food
- limited problem solving: e.g. holiday, dentist, moderately expensive and durable
- extended problem solving: e.g. houses and cars</p>

<p>Influences are:</p>

<p>Individual: perception, motivation and attitude. Perception lages behind reality (e.g. Skode). Remember hierarchy of needs: Hunger and thirst, security, protection, affection, success, status, personal fulfilment
Group: conform to values, belong
Supplier: manage 4Cs
Situational: context of external environment</p>

<p>Targetting</p>

<p>There are different types of targetting.</p>

<ol>
<li>Undifferentiated targeting: differences between segments are ignored and everything everywhere is targetted. The benefit of this are the economies of scale and it is used for commodities a lot (e.g. Salt, Ford Model T)</li>
<li>Differentiated Targeting: Target more than one segment and the product changes dependant on the segment. (e.g. Airlines Business Class and First Class&#8230;)</li>
<li>Focused Targeting: Concentrate on one segment. (e.g. Ryan air)</li>
<li>Customized Targeting: This is when you customize everything for one specific client. (e.g. Amazon).</li>
</ol>


<p>Relationship Ladder</p>

<p>Prospect -&gt; Customer -&gt; Client -&gt; Supporter -&gt; Advocate -&gt; Partner</p>

<p>A company should try to move customers up the the relationship ladder. A good example might be Amazon with partners in terms of reviews of books and BeOS with a lot of advocates that bring in new customers to the company.</p>

<p>Other examples might be.</p>

<p>Donor pyramid: Enquirers -&gt; Responders -&gt; Occasional donors and subscribers -&gt; Committed donors -&gt; Large gift -&gt; Legacies</p>

<p>Supporter pyramid: Potential supporter -&gt; casual supporter -&gt; reliable supporter -&gt; active supporter -&gt; leaders
(this could also apply for BeOS and is moving to closer and more long-term relationships)</p>

<p>Cost of Quality</p>

<p>Quality can cost 20-30% of a companies revenue. There are different costs to take into account.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The costs of conformance
Appraisal costs: costs of inspections and its associated activities
Prevention costs: associated with designing, implementing and maintaining a quality management system to prevent quality problems.</p></li>
<li><p>The costs of non-conformance
Internal failure costs: scrapping defects, repeating work, trying a second time
External failure costs: when poor quality reaches the customer
Costs of exceeding requirements: specification for a product goes beyond what the customers want. Especially if features do not add value.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Traditionally you tried to mix those two costs so that you would be at a minimum, meaning that you have low costs in both fields. Today it is more frequent to believe that there is no optimum level but you just need to decide that now you spent enough.</p>

<p>External and Internal Exchange Process</p>

<p>In this exchange process there must be something that is exchanged that is of mutual value. There must be the belief on both sides that the exchange is fair and equitable. This means that you shouldn&#8217;t add features that the customer does not want and that this exchange could  be non-monetary.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>Now itÃ¢â¬â¢S your job to move things forward and get the change process under way in your area of responsibility. There is no one best strategy.</p>

<p>Five change strategies were described by Thurley and Wirdenius (1973):
-   Directive strategies: managementÃ¢â¬â¢s right to manage change; fast; valuable info lost, resistance
-   Expert strategies: management of change as problem solving; special project team because of expertise and fast; not accepted and resistance
-   Negotiating strategies: bargaining about change; willingness to negotiate; may take longer
-   Educative strategies: managing change means winning hearts and minds; persuasion, education, training and selection; positive commitment; take much longer; takes more resources.
-   Participative strategies: weÃ¢â¬â¢re all involved in making the changes; widely accepted; learning; more skills in the decision; opportunities for staff; long, complex, resource intensive</p>

<p>There are several factors that help decide which route to take.
-   Urgency of the situation
-   Degree of opposition
-   Power base
-   Need for information and commitment</p>

<p>You should also see that change does not always generate irreconcilable positions and conflicts, and that debate and opposition are not necessarily band may lead to improvements in the proposed changes.</p>

<p>Here are some of the main reasons why people resist change by Kanter (cited by Lorenz, 1985):
-   Loss of control
-   Loss of face
-   Loss of identity
-   Loss of competence
-   Excessive personal uncertainty
-   Surprise
-   More work
-   Past resentments
-   Unintended consequences
-   Real threats</p>

<p>Resulting strategies are:
-   Avoid unnecessary change
-   Communication and education
-   Participation and involvement
-   Support and development
-   Negotiation and bargaining
-   Building coalitions and alliances
-   Manipulation and co-option (buying off of the outspoken opposition)
-   Explicit and implicit coercion</p>

<p>It seems that manipulation and co-option is just how it is done. Trust versus control.</p>

<p>The best a manager can do is to be as clear and honest as possible with those involved about what has already been decided and about what choices are still to be made or can be influenced, even if this means people are only involved in aspects of the implementation, rather than the change decision itself.</p>

<p>You will also want to encourage a positive involvement and commitment to the change process. But:
-   what are the risks of over-commitment
-   is full agreement necessary
-   should all opposition be overcome</p>

<p>Commitment planning can be done via a chart used to show the level of commitment:
-   Opposed or not committed
-   Let
-   Help
-   Make</p>

<p>O would indicate their current and X their needed position</p>

<p>You might find it useful to:
-   use rewards
-   treat immediate problems
-   be a role model
-   use peer group pressure
-   encourage sharing of positive changes</p>

<p>You should also think about creating a climate for change. Kanter et al (1992) said that you should take the risk of creating a culture and an environment in which everyone in the organisation can initiate and explore changes and innovations.</p>

<p>It is also important to evaluate and monitor change.</p>

<p>A checklist:</p>

<p>Preparing for change
-   maintain a climate of change
-   be alert to problems
-   careful diagnosis
-   consider driver and restraining forces
-   decide on involvement
-   do benefits outweigh costs
-   which strategy</p>

<p>Implementing change
-   decide on goals
-   plan the change and draw a timetable
-   remember cost and look at resources
-   monitor
-   keep a reserve for unexpected things
-   indentify resistance
-   consider methods to lower resistance</p>

<p>Consolidate change
-   monitor
-   modify
-   reinforce and consolidate</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>The main problem is that people may not see the need for change or may think the reason is mistaken; it may threaten practices that people value highly; may have unintended consequences; may threaten the interest of some staff. Some see it with enthusiasm others as a threat.</p>

<p>Our reactions will depends on our attitudes and on the circumstances and details.</p>

<p>Kanter et al (1992) identified three different roles in the change process:
-   change strategist or initiator
-   changer implementers
-   change recipients</p>

<p>Typically if you are the middle manager you are the recipient but also have some responsibility for implementing it which is a source of tension.</p>

<p>Our attitudes to change are shaped by what we perceive to be its likely consequences.</p>

<p>To change or not to change? The first problem is if it is warranted and feasible. We often only make sense of change after the fact. When initiating it you do not have the benefit of hindsight.</p>

<p>You may start with a vague Ã¢â¬Ëthings are not rightÃ¢â¬â¢ but only raise difficult issues until you are sure it is necessary which is why sometimes the crisis preleads the change.</p>

<p>Another issue is defining the scope. Where do you stop? LeavittÃ¢â¬â¢s diamond provides a useful example. If you make a change in one area you need to consider the likely implications in other areas and the balance between the four components. Task, People, Structures, System.</p>

<p>You can use force-field analysis to assess the prospects. Kurt Lewin suggested that any group is held in balance and that means that it prevents movement.</p>

<p>You have driving forces and restraining forces and want to move the balance from the original state to the desired future state.</p>

<p>It often helps to cluster the forces:
-   personal
-   interpersonal
-   intergroup
-   technological
-   financial
-   organisational
-   environmental</p>

<p>Think about it. Are the driving forces going to grow stronger? Is it realistic to expect that restraining forces to slacken or could they build up? You should try to shift the forces in favor of change. There are may also be no such thing as an equilibrium and different parts will probably change at different rates.</p>

<p>The aim of force-field analysis is not to create well-defined battle lines but to make a realistic, all-round as
sessment of the prospects for change.</p>

<p>Some see the change process as a three-phase model. We set of knowing only roughly where we are headed and a key competence is the ability to tolerate, perhaps to even enjoy a degree of uncertainty and ambiguity.</p>

<p>The best known model is of Lewin (1951). Unfreezing, change or movement and then refreezing. Nowadays preparing, changing and consolidating is preferred as the other wording was too rigid.</p>

<p>Phase 1 Ã¢â¬â preparing should be about how best to mobilise support for your ideas from your managers, staff and other relevant parties. Leadership and networking will be important as well as communication and providing a sense of direction. This phase is about people coming to terms with the need for change and starting to consider possibilities. Your role will be to contain (neither rejecting nor reinforcing) the feelings and reactions.</p>

<p>Think like this:
Dissatisfaction + Vision of a better future + Safe first step there &gt; cost</p>

<p>It may be possible to mitigate some of the costs by offering more help or assistance to those most affected by the change.</p>

<p>Phase 2 Ã¢â¬â changing is important is planning and control, managing individuals and groups; exercising power; using your leadership skills; keeping your group in step with external demands; managing decision making; self-awareness  and style. Be prepared to encounter unforeseen factors, unanticipated sources of resistance and unexpected consequences and so on. Build some slack into plans.</p>

<p>Phase 3 Ã¢â¬â consolidating was described by Kanter et al (1992) as the phase of reinforcement and institutionalisation. Making sure the new behaviours are incorporated in the day-to-day operations.</p>

<p>Hence it is necessary to monitor and take appropriate actions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>Leadership involves influencing others to follow a particular direction or aim for a particular goa. There are three approaches.</p>

<p>Trait theories is what makes someone an effective leader is their own their own personality and personal qualities; that is, leaders are born, not made. The consensus says that intelligence, initiative, self-confidence, an orientation towards achievement and interpersonal skills are important.</p>

<p>Style theories say that it is peopleÃ¢â¬â¢s behaviour rather than their psychological characteristics that determines weather they are effective leaders and this can be described as a concern for task and concern for people. The managerial grid of Blake and Mouton (1962) can be helpful here.</p>

<p>(concern for task/production, concern for people)
-   (1,9): Country club management: production is incidental to lack of conflict and good relationship
-   (1,1) Impoverished management: effective production unobtainable because people are lazy, apathetic and indifferent. Sound and mature relationships are difficult to achieve because human nature being what it is, conflict is inevitable
-   (5,5) Dampened pendulum: Middle of the road, push for production but donÃ¢â¬â¢t go all out; give some but not all. Be fair and firm
-   (9,1) Task management: People are a commodity, just like machines. A managerÃ¢â¬â¢s responsibility is to plan, direct and control the work of those subordinate to him or her
-   (9,9) Team management: Production is from integration of task and human requirements</p>

<p>Contingency theories say that what constitutes an effective style of leadership will depend on the situation. Early theorist is Fiedler (1967) Favourableness depends on:
-   leader-member relationship
-   task structure
-   the leaderÃ¢â¬â¢s position power</p>

<p>He also found that:
-   task oriented leaders perform better in situations which are either very favourable or very unfavourable
-   relationship-oriented leaders perform better in moderate faourableness
-   performance depends on the situation and the style</p>

<p>The most important thing here is that a good leader fits his style to the situation. Fiedler said the style is fixed and the situation should be worked on. Then again, Hersey and Blanchard (1988) disagreed and said the style should be adapted.</p>

<p>Some problems here include:
-   often the manager is not the leader
-   itÃ¢â¬â¢s about working effectively not about giving a sense of direction
-   you influence your situation Ã¯Â¿Â½ it cannot be objectively analysed</p>

<p>Hoskings (1997) says you should think of leadership as a process. The influence needs to be acceptable and who is regarded as the leader depends on what the leader does and the expectations and perceptions of the followers.</p>

<p>ItÃ¢â¬â¢s about tackling core issues:
-   Strategic issues
-   Task issues
-   People or maintenance problem</p>

<p>There are three important implications:
-   A leader is someone who influences how the group tackles the core issues it faces but does not necessarily have formal authority
-   A group can have more than one leader and therefore leadership can be focused or dispersed.
-   Knowledge of the wider environment and an understanding of how it is likely to affect the group is needed. Effective networking and being a good ambassador are important leadership skills.</p>

<ol>
<li>Leadership abilities and skills</li>
</ol>


<p>There are three main functions: strategic, task and interpersonal.</p>

<p>Leadership is about acceptable influence and effective persuasion depends on knowledge and expertise and on developing interpersonal relationships based on mutual trust and understanding.</p>

<p>A personÃ¢â¬â¢s ability to lead depends on their influence within a group and their influence outside it. Being an ambassador and being able to communicate your knowledge is very important. You should also be a role model especially in dealing with interpersonal relationships and for establishing shared values and norms of individual performance and behaviour.</p>

<p>Networking builds up from what we learn from other people and they can be a vital resource. Remember that networking is not about friends but rather about friends of friends. There are some things to consider:</p>

<p>Networks and exchange is a social network, a means of making exchanges and each party gains something.
Entering networks have no formal means of joining and you gradually become part by building a relationship. Some members are more influential and are called the gatekeepers.
Choosing networks is important as with too many networks they become an end in itself.
Creating networks only works if people get something out of it.
Networks and equal opportunities is something you should remember as sometimes they have a negative effect as you can become a clique and people may be kept out of networks for gender or race or other things.</p>

<p>Being an ambassador means you represent the group and are a mobiliser and a director of the group.</p>

<p>Communication skills are very important and it is important to be clear. They are needed to influence people. You need to build channels to communicate effectively.</p>

<p>Being a role model is wonderful as whether you know it or not you lead by example. You are more likely to be effective if your deeds match your words.</p>

<p>To maintain morale, cohesion and commitment create a climate in which conflict is handled constructively. You will need to be able to take some criticism and to absorb some of the anxieties and tensions of the group without over-reacting.
You need to keep a sense of proportion and maintain you sense of optimism, enthusiasm and humor. A group needs a clear sense of where things are going what it is they are trying to achieve while believing the objectives to be important.</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Influence occurs when a person or a group affects what another person or group does and/or thinks.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Power is the potential or capacity of a person or group to influence other people or groups.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Authority is one particular kind of power given to an individual or group.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Power depends on the relationship and the success of using power will depend on the values that you have to offer and the trust and respect in you.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Power also could derive from difference, i.e. a needed specialist.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Power depends on the belief and not on what you actually have at your disposal.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Power is never one sided and other peoples power should not be viewed as negative.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Power is contextual as in the fact that your potential to influence depends on the context of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sources of Power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Classic framework from French and Raven (1960). There are different power bases (sources of power):&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Position and authority: your position entitles you to do certain things, backed by rules, regulations and resources. This is mostly not over people but over tasks and functions that need to be performed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control of resources: Control of any resources is important within and between companies. To reduce peopleÃ¢â¬â¢s power of you reduce your dependence on their resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social connections: Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬â¢s now what you know but who you know thatÃ¢â¬â¢s important.Ã¢â¬? Your capacity to influence will depend on your ability to gather information and mobilise resources and support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertise: being an expert. This is most acceptable but your expertise needs to be recognised. Technical knowledge is about a product or service. Process knowledge is about how to get things done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control of information: people who control information are often called gatekeepers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal characteristics: colleaguesÃ¢â¬â¢ respect, loyalty and trust. Charisma or respect for the integrity, judgement and consideration of someone who is influential behind the scenes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You are often driven by a mixture of them. Remember that your sources of power will vary from situation to situation.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Influence strategies Ã¢â¬â the six Ps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The use of position: influence others by using the authority of your position. Your position to impose rules and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Push strategies attempt to influence by imposing or threatening to impose costs on your target. This will depend on your position and the resources you control and might lead to a climate of fear and distrust.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Pull (reward) strategies are the basis of theories of motivation and depends on the reward being desired and fair. Praise and recognition are often used.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Persuasion is the achievement of influence through appeals to reason. You can draw on your expertise and control of information and the delivery of the argument is important. This is the preferred option because people will do what you want because they believe in what you are trying to do. But avoid assuming that other people share your values, see things like you do and that they are wrong if they disagree.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Preparatory strategies prepare the ground for future attempts at influence possibly by trying to build a positive relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Preventive strategies are for preventing certain action, such as stopping questions being raised, holding back info or suppressing dissent. The danger is that if they are revealed they can lead to a breakdown of openness and trust.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You need to use your power responsibly and the influence you find acceptable will depend on your own values and weather those you are trying to affect find your influence strategies acceptable. You should think of your relationship and the unwritten psychological contract.
-   The nature of your authority and influence
-   Your style of management
-   Reward and punishment
-   Your contribution&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is about two groups purposefully linking up to achieve something.</p>

<p>This involves negotiation of boundaries and can be strategic alliances or intra-organisation learning.</p>

<p>Failure often comes from tension and conflict. But boundaries are about difference and hence some of them have to be overcome like different ways of working or concepts of effectiveness.</p>

<p>Resource-dependency theory is one way of thinking about this as you gain power over the dependence on key resources. They need what others offer. It assumes that actions are taken only when they clearly benefit the interests of the group and that impasse results when interests of two groups are not exactly aligned.</p>

<p>Collaborative advantage is a simple rational exchange between parties, about creating joint value. 1+1 &gt; 2. This can only be achieved by building trusting, open and high-commitment relationships.</p>

<p>There are several stages of collaboration:
-   Seeking agreement
-   Selecting mode
o   Legal form
o   Number of participants
o   Duration
o   Range of joint assets
o   Range of activities
o   Intensity of co-operation
o   Distribution of rights
-   indentifying and attracting partners
-   Evaluation collaborative capability
-   Starting work
o   Structure
o   Action
o   Goals
o   Accountabilities
-   Evaluation collaborative ventures</p>

<p>You should look out at the interdependence of groups as this needs to be equal and noone should only depend on the other. (low, sequential or reciprocal)</p>

<p>There is also a culture in working in a group and you need to foster than and manage it. Policies and culture are important.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Meetings differ in their purpose, expectations, rights and responsibilities and how they should be run.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Briefing meetings are there to instruct people and tell them what is expected of them. They need to understand and be free to ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Business meetings are decision-making meetings with a more or less formal agenda. Information is shared, issues discussed and decisions made. Common fault is to discuss everything at great length.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Planning meetings take time and are usually better delegated to a smaller subgroup with a clear brief.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Consultation meetings are normally there to get the opinions of the people who are invited to attend. Should be well planned, with clear brief, and they should be chaired by someone with a facilitative style that will elicit information.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Review and evaluation meetings are held to assess how the organisation is achieving its collective and individual goals.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes things can be done in other ways:
-   decisions delegated to individuals
-   Information passed on in written form
-   Consultation meetings by one-to-one meetings, Ã¢â¬Â¦
-   Support during individual supervision or paired working arrangements
-   Responsibility allocated to individuals&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Advantages
-   involvement Ã¯Â¿Â½ sense of ownership
-   Democratic style
-   Staff skills improved
-   Increased satisfaction
-   Good communication
-   Staff kept in contact
-   Junior staff access to management
-   Decision making improved
-   Managers keep in touch
-   Members stay involved&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages
-   staff away from other work
-   expensive
-   take longer
-   individual responsibility and initiative dampened Ã¯Â¿Â½ less satisfaction
-   possibly poor decisions&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Remember there is no one right way to run a meeting. There are different types.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Adversarial meetings are more likely when members represent many different constituencies and points of view. There is open debate, you lobby for your view, no agreement but a vote and limited trust.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Consensual meetings happen when members have similar values, beliefs and goals. There is open sharing and you are elaborate. You put your self interest below the group and the decisions of the group emerge fitting the needs of the group.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;On top of that comes the formal and informal meetings.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Influences on a meeting depend on the underlying values and goals, the attitudes and skills of members and tradition is important.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Opportunities depend on the style. The formal-adversarial meeting encourages individual achievement and requires political skills. It pays to prepare. It also depends heavily on a skilful and effective chairperson.
The consensual meeting places the emphasis on the group effort and the chairperson is less needed. Listening skills, clear, assertive presentation, openness and honesty and respect and interest for others are important things.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You should indentify the culture and style and then you will be more aware of the fit between you and the meeting and might be able to adapt your personal style to fit.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are different functions at meetings.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;For example, somebody needs to be chairing and facilitating which is needed when there are more than 6 people in the team. The style should be appropriate to the type of meeting, congruent with the culture and style of the meeting and consented to by the majority of the ordinary members.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Here are some possible functions of a chairperson&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Traditional Chairperson
-   ensure fair play
-   stay in charge
-   stay neutral
-   open the meeting
-   state the purpose
-   introduce all agenda items
-   get through
-   close
-   select speakers
-   ask questions
-   summarise
-   end discussions
-   make people stick to subject
-   arbitrate disputes
-   control interruptions
-   ensure decisions are taken
-   decide when to move on
-   conduct vote
-   ensure responsibilities
-   work by rules
-   act on behalf of the meeting
-   pursue decisions
-   represent groups&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Facilitative chairperson
-   have an overview of tasks/goals
-   help group take responsibility
-   help group carry out tasks
-   have little emotional invest.
-   Run though agenda, approve
-   Arrange intros
-   Update latecomers
-   Keep track of time
-   Evaluate meeting
-   Encourage participation
-   Encourage viewpoints
-   Encourage stick to subject
-   Clarify discussions
-   Make it safe for feelings
-   Handle conflict
-   Remind of procedures
-   Look at agreements
-   Test to see agreements
-   Ensure tasks to be carried out
-   Help decisions&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You can either let the chairperson learn over time or rotate chairpersons to let everyone learn.
During the meeting it is helpful to receive feedback on how effective you were and what you could do to improve.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The secretary is another task that is needed sometimes. Primary skills are note taking and an important planning role. For example spelling out what the meeting is expected to do will help you avoid problems and help people prepare.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The official record must happen and it is important to be accurate and impartial. Decisions, results and exact wordings of proposals or resolutions are important. Also who was present and such should be there.
Useful is an action column in the margin of the minutes where you put peopleÃ¢â¬â¢s names if they should do something.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The framework of a meeting has both overt and hidden components. This includes the agenda and other papers, the minutes, the room layout, the rules and protocols, the language and the understandings.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<time datetime="2003-04-03T11:54:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 3<span>rd</span>, 2003</time>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Generally we would say that a team is a set of people who have a strong sense of cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the informalities of a group can be better. Teams decide slower as a consensus is needed. Teams are rather conventional then innovative. A team can better compromise&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;But the greater the task uncertainty, the more importing team work gets. Decisions are partly based on the opinions and personal visions of those involved.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;However, poor team working can be expensive. AdairÃ¢â¬â¢s (1983) leadership model shows the main constituents of team effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Work alone or in Groups
- simple tasks or puzzles
- co-operating sufficient
- minimum discretion required
- fast decision needed
- few competences are required
- membersÃ¢â¬â¢ interests are inherently conflicting
- organisation credits individ for operational outputs
- innovative responses sought&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;When to build teams
- complex tasks or problems
- consensus essential
- lots of choices and uncertain
- high commitment is needed
- lots of competencies
- membersÃ¢â¬â¢ objectives can be galvanises
- orga rewards team results
- balanced views are sought&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Based on Adair (1983) there are three elements to team effectiveness and they can be configured as an iceberg with only the task achievement above water and individual membersÃ¢â¬â¢ needs and team interaction below. So the big part is the process part which is under water.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In forming the team you normally look at skills, knowledge and experience, overlooking important personal qualities and attributes are overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Here is what BelbinÃ¢â¬â¢s team roles come in.
-   Plant: creative, imaginative, unorthodox
-   Implementer: idea -&gt; action, decisions -&gt; tasks
-   Completer-finisher: painstaking and conscientious
-   Monitor-evaluator: dispassionate, critical analysis, judges accurately
-   Resource investigator: contacts, improviser, enthusiastic
-   Shaper: task oriented, brings drive, makes things happen
-   Teamworker: harmony, listens, builds
-   Co-ordinator: clarifies goals, chairperson
-   Specialist: provides rare skills and knowledge&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;For a team leader, an important part of team and individual development is to create awareness of the roles to be played and to develop abilities in playing to strengths and handling allowable weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Fixing weaknesses might lead to undermining the strengths. Remember that everyone has 1-4 team roles. There are secondary team roles. Adopting roles that are neither natural nor secondary will be uncomfortable and ineffective. You also need a balance of team roles and weaknesses should be accepted and managed.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;10% of people do not work well in teams.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Stages of team building are (as of Tuckman and Jensen, 1977):
-   Forming: crucial, get to know each other, put at ease
-   Storming: resolve issues, encourage shared goals, clear the air
-   Norming: ensure norms are conducive, facilitate team cohesion
-   Performing: give credit where credit is due. Reward the team.
-   Adjourning (or mourning): aware of uncertainties, minimise stress&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Katzenbach and Smith (1993) said that there is a working group, pseudo-team, potential team, real team and high-performing team.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The manager or team leader exercise considerable sensitivity and judgement, a lightness of touch is called for. The leader needs to be detached. You need to be able to judge when it is appropriate to work directly and intensively on teambuilding and when it is best to allow procedures to occur less consciously.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Enhancing team performance is likely to be effective if it has a goal that is clear and is considered important and worthwhile. Then you need to decide on the goals and priorities of individual team members and allocating tasks to them.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how well does the task fit to the individual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who has the skills and experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who will find the task useful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You also need to develop trust which is likely to happen when people respect each otherÃ¢â¬â¢s views and can be demonstrated through involvement and autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
