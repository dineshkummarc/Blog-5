  <div class="entry-content"><p>Interesting post by Mark Fletcher from Bloglines about <a href="http://www.wingedpig.com/archives/000169.html">Giving Up</a>. What he means is that if you try to get a typical career your life will be about getting more control, more power, more people, more money, &#8230; all that stuff. If you however found a company, this is not what it will be like. You will have to give stuff up. You start with everything and then suddenly other people need to make decisions, other people need part ownership of the company, &#8230; . Pretty logical, pretty basic, should be obvious, but isn&#8217;t until you see it written.</p>

Then you might want to take a look at <a href="http://www.rssauction.com/">RSSAuction</a> which allows you to build RSS feeds based on searches on eBay. Very cool, even though I have to admit that I <em>never</em> bought anything at eBay yet. Maybe there is some growth left in the company ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Great article by Seth Godin entitled <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2004/08/time_to_take_ac.html">&lt;i&gt;Time to take action?&lt;/i&gt;</a>:</p>

<p>&lt;i&gt;So stop thinking about how crazy the times are, and start thinking about what the crazy times demand. There has never been a worse time for business as usual. Business as usual is sure to fail, sure to disappoint, sure to numb our dreams. That&#8217;s why there has never been a better time for the new. Your competitors are too afraid to spend money on new productivity tools. Your bankers have no idea where they can safely invest. Your potential employees are desperately looking for something exciting, something they feel passionate about, something they can genuinely engage in and engage with.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Especially the last part about employees is sticking in my head more and more which you read several times if you read this blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been using <a href="http://www.rsscalendar.com/">RSSCalendar.com</a> for several days now, and I am getting used to it now. It&#8217;s a free only calendar application that is published via RSS feeds and allows you to invite some people that you can then share your calendar with. John Pacchetti, who is the man behind the service, really had a very nice idea with this and I had a wonderful eMail conversation with him in the last few days. There are some things that the service still needs, but I am positive that John is onto them and am looking forward to seeing them implemented. I suggest you try out the service, espcially if you are interested in RSS and where it could be taken. I orginally got the link from <a href="http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2004/08/rss_calendar.html">Jeff Nolan&#8217;s post about it</a> and Nick Bradbury <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/08/rsscalendar.html">mentioned</a> that the service has no been <a href="http://news.com.com/RSS+gets+down+to+business/2100-1012_3-5311747.html?tag=nefd.top">covered by CNet</a> which should give him some good exposure. Congratulations John!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As <a href="http://www.ensight.org/archives/2004/08/17/google-ipo-to-price-low/">Jeremy pointed out</a>, word on the street is that the Google shares will likely start trading below the $108 minimum bid that was set for the auction at first. <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B6F6DE20F-C563-4AE7-8705-B717177B0449%7D&amp;amp;siteid=google&amp;amp;dist=google">CBS Marketwatch is also reporting</a> that there are just too few bidders, at least at the higher prices. If they get in at something like $20, then I would start to be thinking about investing really. Maybe even $30. I&#8217;d have to redo <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/05/my_own_google_v.html">my own Google valuation</a> which was done before they announced the share numbers. But my valuation in the first item was correct and came out at roughly $100 per share. So if we take $140 there, therefore adding 40% to my other prices, a valuation I would be comfortable with would be about $30. Of course being in Germany, I can&#8217;t really invest until after the IPO.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: The google debut on the stock market is <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3575022.stm">delayed</a> it seems. SEC authorization is not there yet.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update 2&lt;/b&gt;: Trading will start between $85 and $95 accounting to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3575680.stm">this BBC article</a> and on top of that selling shareholders will only sell about 5 million instead of 11 million shares. It actually bothers me a great deal that part of the IPO is based on shareholders selling shares instead of the company anyway. At 5 Million shares and $100 per share, that puts something like $500 million (a bit less if you take out fees and such) directly into the pockets of big VCs and the founders, to name a few. &quot;Don&#8217;t do bad.&quot; could be true here, as this is really not bad deal for them. I am starting to wonder if the &quot;Don&#8217;t do bad.&quot; doesn&#8217;t apply for shareholders of the company.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update 3&lt;/b&gt;: Authorization by the SEC is out. <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GOOG">GOOG</a> listed. They could be starting to trade today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;We now had economics concern. We all agreed that environmental ones are important too. So what about the social ones? This is something that will grow of importance and boy did I have some fights at residential school about this. What is more important, making money or that the company and the employees share their values? Might some values be more important than money?</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Charles Handy and Rosabeth Moss Kanter seem to argue that people will opt to work for those companies whos values they share. So what is a company to do?&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;donate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allow staff to volunteer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;social marketing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ethical investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;social auditing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&#8230; this is what the book says. I&#8217;d say Google is pretty close to it: &quot;Don&#8217;t do bad.&quot;  That&#8217;s that really. Microsoft matches a donation by their employees with the same amount if I am not mistaken. I&#8217;d say that simply doing the right thing is important. Having a leader you want to follow. Especially the really good people will be able to decide where they want to work and many of them will not only make their decisions based on money. And this is a real monetary thing on why to be socially resposible. The other thing is that it&#8217;s just the damn right thing to do!&lt;/p&gt;</p>
