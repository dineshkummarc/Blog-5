  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>You should take charge of your personal development and plan your career as the burden of career planning has shifted heavily on to the individual.</p>

<p>Sonnefeld et al (1988) identified four classifications of companies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fortresses: preoccupied with survival</li>
<li>Baseball teams: recruit externally, you identify with the professions not the company</li>
<li>Academies: Promote from within</li>
<li>Clubs: more concern for seniority and status then profit</li>
</ul>


<p>â€œ It is no longer functional to define education as a process of transmitting what is known; it must now be defined as a lifelong process of enquiry. â€œ â€“ Knowles, 1980</p>

<p>There are 3 different ways of learning (MUD): from Memory, Understand and Doing.</p>

<p>Adults learn different then children and Knowles showed some differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Self-directive</li>
<li>Experienced</li>
<li>Ready to learn</li>
<li>Problem-centered</li>
</ul>


<p>You will have four stages in learning: concrete experience, reflection, conceptualisation, testing.</p>

<p>People have different learning styles: Activist (concrete experience), Reflector (Observation, reflection), Theorist (Conceptualisation) and Pragmatist (Testing).</p>

<p>You need a plan, that is the most important part and some things will play a role in your future life. Those are bio-social, family relationships and career related.</p>

<p>To find out what are your core values, Schein used the term â€˜career anchorâ€™ in 1978. There are several classifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Technical / Function competence</li>
<li>General managerial competence</li>
<li>Autonomy / Independence</li>
<li>Security / Stability</li>
<li>Entrepreneurial creativity</li>
<li>Sense of service / dedication</li>
<li>Pure challenge</li>
<li>Lifestyle</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>Why do some theories not seem to fit with every management job? This is really due to the complexity in management: No two management positions are alike. Problems can be bound (small and well defined) or unbound (large and poorly defined). Simon (1960) provided a good insight into the problem-solving process of managers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bounded rationality: We want to act rational but are unable to do so.</li>
<li>Satisficing: You want to do the best but settle for what is â€œgood enoughâ€?.</li>
<li>Types of decisions: Programmed decisions are repetitive and routine, unprogrammed are new and unstructured.</li>
</ul>


<p>Another source of complexity is that you are accountable to so many people: the organisation, customers, colleagues, self.</p>

<p>You will be depending on a group and not only on yourself. You need to manage that group well and pay attention on group size (5-7 is good), group composition (similar=harmony,different=innovative), nature of tasks, resources, external recognition, task and process (tackle task and maintain social relationship), interaction patterns, motivation, group development.</p>

<p>You will have some task functions (proposing/initiating, building, diagnosing, giving and seeking, evaluating, decision making) and some process functions (gate keeping, encouraging, resolving conflict, giving feedback, dealing with feelings, looking after physical needs).</p>

<p>There are several states in group development: Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing. (Tuckman: 1965)</p>

<p>You will also be managing conflict of which there are several layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Misunderstandings</li>
<li>Differences in values and beliefs</li>
<li>Differences of interest and ambition</li>
<li>Interpersonal differences</li>
<li>Feelings and emotions</li>
</ul>


<p>One thing you need to do is address the conflict and work towards a win-win solution (collaborating), which in many cases is very possible. This is a lot better then avoiding, accommodating or forcing a solution.</p>

<p>Once you have identified disagreements you need to do something about it either by non-intervention, prevention or resolutions.</p>

<p>One thing to remember is managerial opportunism(Williamson 1981) which means that you will want things for yourself, not the organisation. That is also part of the management reality and should be taken as such.</p>

<p>Networks are something you will need to build but you should pay attention that you are not in too many networks and that they are diverse groups of different people. Itâ€™s called Groupthink and will result in likewise thinking groups that make up unintelligent discussions.</p>

<p>To sum it up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyone is political</li>
<li>Analyse yourself</li>
<li>Understand others</li>
<li>Listen and encourage</li>
<li>Explain</li>
<li>Match tasks to person</li>
<li>Put negative people in jobs where they do not pull others down</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally Published on the OUBS Blog)</p>

<p>This part of Book 1 is focussing on how to handle transition into management, recognize and respond appropriately to stress and consider issues of time management.</p>

<p>Player-manager tension is a key point in this, as you will need to let other people do the job you did previously and let them learn and take credit. You will also need to pass your knowledge on to those people.</p>

<p>Also mentioned in the transition process that many managers see themselves in. This is based on a research by Adams et al. in 1976 which identified seven stages of transition.</p>

<ul>
<li>Immobilisation [you do not know what to make of your role]</li>
<li>Minimisation [you carry on as though nothing has changed]</li>
<li>Depression [you feel you cannot cope]</li>
<li>Acceptance [you move on and see what you achieve]</li>
<li>Testing [you form your own views and experiment]</li>
<li>seeking meaning [you reflect on your experience]</li>
<li>internalising [you have come to terms with your job]</li>
</ul>


<p>What you need to learn as a manager is that pressure, the force from out side which could be motivating, can result in stress, a mind and body signal making you feel as if you cannot cope.</p>

<p>In 1993 Handy identified five common causes of stress:</p>

<ul>
<li>Responsibility for the work of others</li>
<li>Innovative functions</li>
<li>Integrative or boundary functions</li>
<li>Relationship problems</li>
<li>Career uncertainty</li>
</ul>


<p>He argued that there are role-based sources of tension:</p>

<ul>
<li>Role ambiguity</li>
<li>Role incompatibility</li>
<li>Role conflict</li>
<li>Role overload or underload</li>
</ul>


<p>To deal with stress, the first thing you need to do is identify them early and you need to manage your time. One should analyse your actual use of time and compare it how you would like to use it (Plan, Analyse, Reflect, Change, Review).</p>

<p>You need to balance the urgent with the important.</p>

<p>To reduce stress you can delegate, put more emphasis on the work you should be doing, do training to reduce time spent on specific items, minimize urgent items, use task lists, remove disturbing repeating items, balance and compromise.</p>

<p>Delegation is a very important item that will both help you release time for other activities as well as train your staff. You need to delegate and monitor as you will have to keep control of the things you are responsible for. Things you can delegate are the following (as of Maddux â€“ 1990):</p>

<ul>
<li>Decisions you make most frequently</li>
<li>Functions you are an expert in (most of the time operating tasks)</li>
<li>Tasks and projects for which you are least qualified</li>
<li>Functions you dislike</li>
<li>Work that will provide experience for employees</li>
<li>Tasks that will add variety</li>
<li>Activities that will expand a job</li>
<li>Tasks that will increase the number of people who can perform critical assignments</li>
<li>Opportunities to use and reinforce creative talents</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;(Originally published on the OUBS Blog)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€˜Why do managers do what they do?â€™ 1973, Mintzberg. He found that Managers have 10 roles in 3 Areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Interpersonal&lt;br /&gt;
1.1.    figurehead [representing the organisation]&lt;br /&gt;
1.2.    leader [bring together needs of organisation, individuals]&lt;br /&gt;
1.3.    liason [network of relationships inside and outside of orga.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Informational&lt;br /&gt;
2.1.    monitoring [seeking and receiving info from inside and outside]&lt;br /&gt;
2.2.    dissemination [passing on that information]&lt;br /&gt;
2.3.    spokesperson [to general public and positions of influence]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Decisional&lt;br /&gt;
3.1.    entrepreneurs [proactive, initiate change and take active part]&lt;br /&gt;
3.2.    disturbance handlers [decide from events beyond your control]&lt;br /&gt;
3.3.    resource allocation [scheduling time, programming work, authorizing actions]&lt;br /&gt;
3.4.    negotiation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These roles can overlap, have different weighting and change over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different approaches to management and one item discussed in more detail is scientific management which works by observation, quantification, analysis, experimentation and evaluation to behaviour in the workplace (as of Taylor). You use this to find the best method and to develop and standardised procedure for implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stewart (1982) suggests that any job is a combination of demands and constraints which together define the choices available to a manger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;246&quot; height=&quot;93&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;cert1.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://owt.typepad.com/oubs/images/cert1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have different demands on you:&lt;br /&gt;
-   manager-imposed&lt;br /&gt;
-   peer-imposed&lt;br /&gt;
-   externally imposed&lt;br /&gt;
-   system-imposed&lt;br /&gt;
-   staff-imposed&lt;br /&gt;
-   self-imposed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also have different constraints set against them&lt;br /&gt;
-   resource limitations&lt;br /&gt;
-   legal regulations&lt;br /&gt;
-   trade union agreements&lt;br /&gt;
-   technological limitations&lt;br /&gt;
-   physical location&lt;br /&gt;
-   organisation policies and procedures&lt;br /&gt;
-   peopleâ€™s attitudes and expectations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quote from the book: Thee is often a tension in management between responding to demands (being reactive) and taking the intitiative (being  proactive). This can be a vicious circle, as you need to create the time to take action to reduce short-term demands on your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theory, contingency theory, suggests that an organisation will be more successful if it consciously adapts its structures and its administrative arrangements to the tasks that need to be done. That means that some are performing better under specific circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final thing that is discussed is that the environment has an effect on the organisation. To be exact the changing information and communications technology, deregulation, globalistation, competition and working practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This impacts managers in terms of increasing work load, increased span of control (higher delegation need), more generalist roles, greater emphasis on performance, the squeeze (pressure from above for performance and below due to more people), empowerment, career prospect (security has declined) and impact on lifestyle.
&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just &lt;a title=&quot;birdhouse.org :: U.N. Dues, Stockpiles, and Sanctions&quot; href=&quot;http://www.birdhouse.org/blog/archives/000769.php&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; on Scot Hacker&#8217;s blog about <a href="http://www.casi.org.uk/discuss/1998/msg00300.html">Ramsey Clark&#8217;s Letter to UN</a> from 1998.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;The notion that Iraq is a threat to the region is a false
fantasy created by the U.S. to justify its vast military
presence in the region, to dominate the oil resources and
to contain Islam.  Iraq is no threat to its neighbors as
every Security Council member knows.  It is barely able to
survive.  Turkey regularly attacks the Kurdish people and
others living on northern Iraqi soil at will with U.S.
support and U.N. acquiescence.  There are many nations on
earth that pose far greater threats of minor violence and
to world peace than Iraq.  As the recently published
&quot;Israel and the Bomb&quot;, Columbia University Press, again
demonstrates, Israel developed and has manufactured some
hundreds of nuclear bombs in violation of Security Council
resolutions and international law. &lt;/I&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am currently studying management at the <a href="http://oubs.open.ac.uk/">Open University Business School</a>. Starting with the Certificate in Management, which I finished in January 2002, and the Diploma in Management, a post graduate level course which I finished in January 2003, I am now continuing with an MBA program.</p>

<p>The special thing about studying at the Open University is that it is layed out to be done next to your work, full-time work that is, which is something I wanted to do when looking for a new way to study. I just didn&#8217;t want to do this full time and needed the option to follow through on other fields of interests, which proved very valuable. I soon learned that summing up the books that you have to read is very valuable and it was so in the Certificate. It soon became apparent that it is even more important in the Diploma course as there is a lot more content and with a total of 60 booklets (around 20-40 pages each) that all need to be in your head for the test after 9 months (the last 3 months are a 15000 word project on improving performance). With the summaries I can boil down the number of characters that need to reside in my brain considerably and on top of that the method I used for the summaries, putting them online, provided for the option to search through all of the pages which helps a lot to find things you are looking for.</p>

<p>I will soon try to add all my summaries in here for everyone to search. This will provide a good way for fellow students and other people who are interested in the material to quickly look something up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Great stuff. With their last collider, CERN was using huge amounts of data which had to be stored on solid state harddisk at the time of the particle collision because harddisks were to slow. Now they are trying to prove the Higgs Boson by 2007&#8230; or rather, they are starting by then. So this is from the site about their computing project to make the data collection possible: &lt;I&gt;Welcome ! The CERN openlab is a collaboration between CERN and industrial partners to develop data-intensive Grid technologies to be used by the worldwide community of scientists working at the next-generation Large Hadron Collider. These experiments will generate enormous amounts of data - several million gigabytes a year - and will require a computing environment thousands of times more powerful and functional than anything running on today&#8217;s Internet.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Washington Monthly now has a very interesting article online. The good thing is that it&#8217;s rather ballanced. Seems to be against the current situation in Irak and against the current administration. I mean, the author is saying that they are deceiving the American people (which they are). What the Bush Administration seems to be planninning is very dangerous, but the author also agrees that if it works, it&#8217;s a great plan.
