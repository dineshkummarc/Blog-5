  <div class="entry-content"><p>Looks like germany&#8217;s history books need to be rewritten tomorrow. At least in terms of the hottest day or something. Forecasts for this night are 15-21 degrees Celcius and tomorrow 38!?!?!?!? Degrees is scheduled. That is <em>hot</em> for germany. I am sweating as it is at the moment with 30 degrees inside the place. Sadly, the fan is in brussels (not in the cellar like I thought). I WANT WIND! ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well. Some of you might have read it already, but for the others I suggest reading this article on David Bowie: http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/09/arts/music/09PARE.html?todaysheadlines</p>

<p>One of the more interesting comments is this:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;His deal with Sony is a short-term one while he gets his label started and watches the Internet&#8217;s effect on careers. &quot;I don&#8217;t even know why I would want to be on a label in a few years, because I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to work by labels and by distribution systems in the same way,&quot; he said. &quot;The absolute transformation of everything that we ever thought about music will take place within 10 years, and nothing is going to be able to stop it. I see absolutely no point in pretending that it&#8217;s not going to happen. I&#8217;m fully confident that copyright, for instance, will no longer exist in 10 years, and authorship and intellectual property is in for such a bashing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity,&quot; he added. &quot;So it&#8217;s like, just take advantage of these last few years because none of this is ever going to happen again. You&#8217;d better be prepared for doing a lot of touring because that&#8217;s really the only unique situation that&#8217;s going to be left. It&#8217;s terribly exciting. But on the other hand it doesn&#8217;t matter if you think it&#8217;s exciting or not; it&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to happen.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>The question is if he is correct. There are obviously changes, and the internet gives an artist at least the possibility to distribute his music herself. If that results to the death of copyright and so on I am just not sure. But it is an interesting thought.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some time in february the MPAA made movie88.com close down. Movie88.com was an online video story which let you lets you download all currently playing movies for $1-1.5 (they will stop working after 3 days). At least that&#8217;s what I read.</p>

<p>The interesting part is that now film88.com opened, in Teheran (Iran). ;) For more than 20 years there have been no diplomatic relations between the US and the Iran, meaning that the service is relatively save now ;)</p>

<p>At the moment the site seems to have some proxy problems, or so they say. All in all, the idea is interesting, if true.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It really seems that the new Sony Clie is selling well, and it deserves it!</p>

<p>On one of the biggest PDA shops in germany, online ones at least, <a href="http://www.palmshop.de/">Palmshop</a>, they have a list of the top selling products in the last 7 days, including % of sales. The Clie is currently over 50% and they even list when they will be shipping it the next time!!!</p>

<p>If I wouldn&#8217;t want Bluetooth and a Compact Flash expansion slot, I would be really thinking about this baby.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a PDA, check it out at <a href="http://www.clieplaza.com/">Clie Plaza</a>. If you are not looking, don&#8217;t, because afterwards you will be looking ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on infoSync) Holidays are a wonderful invention, particularly if you&#8217;re going somewhere profoundly different to your home country. Living in wet and cold Germany, hot and dry Egypt sounded like a good plan for a vacation. The interesting thing is that the trip was one of those experiences where I noticed how important coverage and roaming really is, particularly in Europe where we&#8217;ve got small countries and people frequently travel across borders - and thus end up on other mobile phone networks. In this article, I&#8217;ll attempt to give an introduction to how roaming works in general, as well as take a closer look at the more complicated issue of GPRS roaming.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Roaming, in short, is about potentially allowing you to use your phone even if your home network is not reachable, be it because you&#8217;re simply outside the coverage of your home carrier, or because you&#8217;re in another country where there isn&#8217;t even a network that is run by your home carrier or the carrier it&#8217;s a part of. The former approach is among others applied by Viag Interkom (now O2), which doesn&#8217;t offer coverage in all of Germany. Viag Interkom users that are outside the carrier&#8217;s coverage area will be able to use the T-Mobile network instead, which amounts to so-called national roaming. The more common perception of roaming is the latter, though, involving roaming across country borders. If you have a contract with Vodafone in the UK and then take a trip to Germany, your phone will log in to an available german GSM network and do a bit of chatting on its own to find out whether it&#8217;s supposed to just pick a network randomly, or use Vodafone networks in foreign countries if available (more on this later).</p>

<p>I have to admit I&#8217;m used to roaming, frequently travelling between Germany and Belgium, where I even get Frequent Flyer miles for every minute I roam the Belgian Mobistar network with my German T-Mobile contract. I need roaming. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do without it. Going to Egypt, the phone was one of the tech items I took, next to a PDA, digital camera and 6 GB portable MP3 player. I was kind enough to leave the laptop at home (but brought a portable keyboard for my PDA ;). After we arrived at the hotel, I called home to say that we arrived safely, with a view over the Nile.</p>

<p>The hotel in Cairo actually wasn&amp;rsquo;t that impressive in terms of roaming, seeing as how it was mostly populated by Egyptians who were - understandably - chatting away in Egyptian. The fun part began when we moved on to a 7 day stay at the beach in Hurghada, and this is where it hit.</p>

<p>Imagine a hotel full of tourists, all from different countries and everyone - as far as you can see - has a mobile phone and are using it to its fullest extent. There are people at the pool playing games or sending SMS messages, people walking on the beach talking on their phone, lots of phones on tables and frequent ringing to be heard. Thankfully, the place was huge, so fortunately all the bleeping and ringing wasn&#8217;t too prominent, but I think you get the idea. Mobile phones were everywhere, and they were all from different countries. You heard russian, german, french, italian, dutch, english, and several other languages I&#8217;d break my tongue trying to imitate the pronounciation of.</p>

<p>These people, roaming like crazy on the Egyptian network of their preference (or their home carrier&#8217;s preference) are spending an enormous amount of money, divided amongst both the carrier on whose network the mobile phone is operating and the home carrier.</p>

<p>Imagine being in Egypt, sending an SMS to your friend while he or she is currently in Marocco - and you both have a German contract. Now how cool is that if you really think about it? We are taking it for granted here but really; this rocks.</p>

<p>It not only rocks, it also prompted me to look deeper into how this stuff works. Bear with me, this&#8217;ll be a wild and abbreviation-ridden ride, and particularly so once we get to the part that has to do with GPRS roaming.</p>

<p>For the basic GSM roaming, the invaluable website <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/"> title=&quot;How Stuff Works&quot;&gt;How Stuff Works</a> helped a lot in terms of gaining insight - as it always does.</p>

<p>First a few definitions. Each carrier has a so called System Identification Code (SID) - a unique 5-digit number that is assigned to the carrier by the authorative agency in the country. When your phone powers up, it listens for the SIDs that are available over something called a control channel, and compares them to the SID of the home carrier, which is stored in the SIM (Subscriber Identity Model) card of the phone. If the home carrier SID can&#8217;t be found, it will presume that it is roaming. Each carrier also has a, or rather several, Mobile Telephone Switching Offices (MTSO), which handle the base stations and calls. The MTSO keeps track of where your phone is, and negotiates the frequency pair (up and down) for your phone to use if you are placing or getting a call (each base station has several, see our Lexicon section for more info on how GSM works). Once your phone starts talking to an MTSO while roaming, the local MTSO contacts the MTSO in your home network and attempts to find out whether the SID your phone says is the home SID matches the rest of your information to find out whether you really belong in that far away network. Your home system then tells the local MTSO that everything is fine (if you&#8217;re allowed to roam with your contract) and the local MTSO proceeds with its duties, handling assignment to a cell within seconds. Happy roaming.</p>

<p>While this seems simple enough (Editor&#8217;s note: Yeah, right.), things grow quite a bit more complicated when we move on to using GPRS in a foreign network. This is also the reason for why carriers are quick to brag about their GPRS roaming capabilities, an area where Vodafone currently is in the lead due to their numerous local networks.</p>

<p>GPRS is an overlay to GSM networks and needs a bit more hardware, namely a Gateway GPRS Service Node (GGSN) and a Servicing GPRS Service Node (SGSN), present for routing purposes. The GGSN works as a gateway between the GPRS network and the underlying IP (or similar) network and it connects to other GPRS networks for roaming purposes. Once you attempt to access GPRS in a foreign network, it needs to conduct what is called a &#8216;GPRS attach&#8217; to the local SGSN. However, as you&#8217;re not in your own PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network), the SGSN talks to the HLR (Home Location Register) in the PLMN of your home carrier to validate you and see whether you are allowed to roam or not (now read that again ;). From here, there are two scenarios.</p>

<p>Scenario 1: Your phone (called Mobile Station, or MS for short) talks to the SGSN in the visited network (also called VSGSN) and then tries to connect to the GGSN in your home network (also called HGGSN) with signaling going over an Inter GPRS Backbone. For this backbone, a method gaining ground is the so called GPRS Roaming eXchange (GRX) which, in the above case, will need to handle such things as address management between the networks because the address assigned to your MS will be from your home network and needs to be routed in your visited network (think mail forwarding). The GRX connects to two (or more) networks and takes care of routing, interconnection, IP services, network operation and maintenance. In voice connections, this takes place over standard fixed lines.</p>

<p>Scenario 2: You are registering with the VSGSN and then with the VGGSN. In this case your address is local, but the network will need to somehow authenticate you to the GGSN and let you allow to use all your services with your standard settings, which might or might not be available.</p>

<p>Now we move on (yes, there&#8217;s more :) to another fun piece of the puzzle, which is the so-callled APN, or Access Point Name. The APN is made up of things the user entered, the user&amp;rsquo;s subscription record and some defaults by the SGSN. The VSGSN will need to somehow get you an address of a GGSN to connect you to, which, just as a reminder, takes care of your connection. At this time our two senarios come into play again.</p>

<p>In scenario one, the VSGSN talks to the HPLMN, which understands your APN and can provide the VSGSN with the address of the HGGSN (the GGSN in your home network). It might be that the VSGSN tries to talk to the VPLMN to get you the VGGSN IP address to connect to, again with the help of your APN, but the VPLMN just doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do with your APN since the correct information simply isn&#8217;t there. This would then be where the VSGSN connects to the HPLMN - see above.</p>

<p>In scenario two, the VPLMN is able to understand your APN and connects you to a VGGSN.</p>

<p>The APN still provides for some interesting options such as forcing the SGSN to use the HGGSN, but to fully explain this as well would be too in-depth for this general introduction, so I&#8217;ll leave it at that.</p>

<p>Now, if you did not fully understand everything you just read, I suggest you give it another go - or more. You&#8217;ll be happy to know that I myself had to read through it numerous times and talk to several people to get it all sorted out, so it&#8217;s in no way an easy matter to delve into.</p>

<p>As studies have shown, up to 80% of roaming calls are placed to the home country, which in relation to GPRS means that you want the services that you are used to from your home network to be available in the network you are roaming in. For this, the GRX approach is crucial because it will let several networks inter-connect to allow roaming users to use their local services (Scenario 1).</p>

<p>To end this with a slightly amusing anecdote, there was a huge catamaran motorboat at the pier next to the hotel where we stayed. It was lovely, and from what I was told it belonged to the founder of Egy Click GSM, one of the local GSM networks in Egypt. Obviously, there&#8217;s a bit of money to be made in the carrier business, and with roaming being responsible for 15-20 % of some carriers&#8217; revenue I&#8217;ll (not) go out on a limb and guess GPRS roaming is a high priority to the owner of that catamaran as well. I for one volunteer to babysit his boat while he&#8217;s working on it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on <a href="http://www.fool.com/portfolios/RuleMaker/2002/rulemaker020605.htm"> title=&quot;Motley Fool&quot;&gt;Motley Fool</a>) If you listen to some pundits today, you will hear something that would have seemed impossible two years ago: &quot;Wireless is dead.&quot; Others are saying, more plausibly, that we are just undergoing a major shift from voice to data, that the market is extremely uncertain as a result. While I doubt that past predictions that we will all be sending gigabytes of video around on wireless networks will come true, I can tell you why I believe we are at a very big shift, even though it is a lot less spectacular than people were anticipating two years ago. This is not a bad thing. In other words, I do not believe at all that the mobile communications industry is in trouble.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>There are two drivers for change over the near term: More powerful networks and more powerful devices are coming. And I don&#8217;t mean in three years. I mean now. These improvements portend a potential rebound among the leading companies in the sector. Let&#8217;s break these trends down a little.</p>

<ol>
<li>More powerful networks coming of age
While commercial high-speed networks have been &quot;imminent&quot; for several years, they are finally coming to a stage where they are actually useful for a full range of commercial applications. Remember when everyone was excited about WAP? How about the hype that i-mode was going to take over the world. It didn&#8217;t happen partly because our networks were not developed enough to provide commercially acceptable rates of throughput. At last, this base problem is coming to an end.</li>
</ol>


<p>In Europe, deployment of GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) has been going on for some time. To date, though, poor throughput rates have forced mobile networkers to be charged on a per-minute basis as well as on the amount of data sent. Such pricing issues and usage limitations have conspired to lower the rate of consumer adoption of mobile Internet services. For example, T-Mobile, the mobile communications arm of Deutsche Telekom (NYSE: DT) had special per-minute charges on top of the bandwidth charges for GPRS usage due to the fact that the GPRS buildout wasn&#8217;t fully completed yet. The company presumably wanted to (and needed to control) how many people used the service as well as how long they stayed online. As throughput rates have improved, T-Mobile and others have been able to quit charging per-minute rates.</p>

<p>With this comes the fulfillment of the &quot;always online&quot; promise for mobile Internet connections, as opposed to the limited reach and scope of previous services. This new freedom enables consumers to do lots of fun stuff without worrying about by-the-minute charges. More importantly, improved networks are transferring much more data than before and more efficiently. All of these things correspond to higher adoption rates by consumers, and, it is expected, higher average revenue per user for the carriers.</p>

<p>In Japan, average revenue per user is already higher than in many other countries. NTT DoCoMo (NYSE: DCM) has already launched a 3G network with J-Phone, owned partially by Vodafone (NYSE: VOD), and will follow closely with a launch scheduled for June 30. While the technological advancement of the Japanese networks is important, just as crucial has been the vast number of customer services available, including e-mail service, ring tones, and screensavers. What is interesting, though, is that J-Phone is having a huge success with integrated cameras and the option to attach pictures taken from the phone to e-mails.</p>

<ol>
<li>Better, more functional (and fun) devices
J-Phone customers have gone wild over the integrated camera feature in their phones. Connect, a German mobile telecom magazine, recently highlighted the experiences of a guy testing a Nokia (NYSE: NOK) 7650 prototype, including his raves about the fun he had sending around pictures of a colleague who had fallen asleep in a meeting. These types of reports, while they may seem more mirthful than useful, belie a certain truth: As soon as people see uses for the mobile Internet that attract them, they will want to get connected as well. Vodafone is already running an MMS service in Germany, which enables just that with the Sony Ericsson T68i &#8211; surprisingly enough, a product dually produced by Sony (NYSE: SNE) and Ericsson (Nasdaq: ERICY) &#8211; with an attached camera.</li>
</ol>


<p>I recently tested NEC&#8217;s (Nasdaq: NIPNY) 21i on the German i-mode network and it has a color screen and polyphonic ring tones. Those are also real distinct changes, something people will notice right away. My friends loved the color screen. It was so much easier to read and when I used Google to find an explanation, they were sold on it. When the phone rang (with the Muppets theme song, by the way, in full polyphony), the entire table said that these ring tones were worth paying for. Another wonderful item is that e-mails are delivered right to the phone, which is just superior to an SMS arriving over WAP alerting the user of a new e-mail, which I do with my T-Mobile subscription.</p>

<p>I was also fortunate enough to have a bit of firsthand experience with the O2 XDA. The device, built by HTC, is a Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) PocketPC 2002 PhoneEdition device, wonderfully mixing phone capabilities with those of a personal digital assistant. This is a perfect thing for the corporate market and, though earlier generations of phone/PDA combinations have yet to catch on, just think about the added capability of &quot;always online&quot; Internet connections to the mix.</p>

<p>While Java itself is not as easy to use, downloadable games are going well in Germany and that will become more popular once Java phones are more common. There will be a lot of extra applications that will let people do extra things on their phone. The first application for the Nokia 7650 from a third party was just shown and it&#8217;s a simple encryption tool that lets you put your passwords and pin codes on your phone in an encrypted manner. It&#8217;s simple, but many could find it to be one of the things they need to let go of their PDA, at least part time.</p>

<p>Many phones now have GPRS capabilities and the price points for the low-end GPRS phones are dropping, which will drive adoption rates. Certainly, users need to gain experience, and the earlier overhyping may not help. I have friends who have flatly stated that they would not use the wireless Internet, but then reflected on their SMS usage and said that two years ago they wouldn&#8217;t have thought about using it, either. Now they think it&#8217;s the best invention since the telephone.</p>

<p>It takes time for these things to be adopted, but if you look at the integrated picture, there are some rather simple but effective changes coming right around the corner that will push the mobile technologies sector out of its growing pains.</p>

<p>The only thing we will still need to learn now is probably best said by Ricardo Semler, in his book Maverick:</p>

<p>&quot;As I tell our people constantly: We&#8217;ve all learned how to answer email on Sundays, but none of us has learned to go to the movies on Monday afternoon. Until we learn that, we are email slaves harnessed to the wicked ways of the Profit and Loss Master.&quot;</p>

<p>The future devices might actually help there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, after Avonia&#8217;s shift ended at 23:30, we went out to a pub with some of the hotel people to get a drink as we often do. This time, right next to us, were two guests. To guys from Saudi-Arabia, who paid for everything. They are two of those oil people, being in Germany because their mother had some operation here. They were dressed in western style and it was a fun evening, oh what stories.</p>

<p>We got started talking about casinos based on my talks with Hans yesterday and he started raving about his experience. First of all, never go in to win but go in to have some fun, just take $3000 dollars or whatever and plan to loose them. ;)</p>

<p>He did this in Egypt (Cairo) he said and was loosing a few thousand each night for two weeks, then on his last day he was in one casino and after loosing $800 he put $100 on 17 and won. So he just took out the $100 again and let the rest there, 17 won again, he went out with about $17000, on to the next casino, won again (always telling us the hotel names where he was to play, many of them have a casino). He went to like 5 of them and ended up winning over $200.000. The last hotel he was in, where he won $70.000 was the Inter-Continental Samiramis. Interestingly enough, Avonia and me stayed there when we have been in Cairo this year. The Samiramis does not have a Casino ;) It was a very fun story though and I was told that you can really believe most what he said, at least in the hights of money he is loosing and playing with. Juan, one of the hotel guys, talked to them a bit more about when they were in Spain, where he lived, and it seems that they really knew a lot about those places again and he knew those folks from back there and there are nights when they just treat lots of people for a few drinks.</p>

<p>A very fun evening indeed and I was almost dragged to go shopping for a laptop with the other (a little dumb, as agreed by everybody there) guy of the two. He just lost his digital camera and passport (with $1000 in it his gf said &#8230; $200 in it he said a few hours later ;)). When they went out around 2, he almost forgot his mobile phone on the table ;)</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will go to the pub again, around 12:30. 13:30, the german football match starts, live over huge TV screens in the pub. Maybe we&#8217;ll get another 8:0 again. :)</p>

<p>There is a store chain here in Germany that said at the beginning of the world championships that that they would reduce their prices by 5% 2 days after the game for every goal the german team has in a game. On one product line that is. Well, they were bought empty this time, with 40% reduction, but hey, that&#8217;s advertisement that they would not have been able to pay for.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Karl Lagerfeld was in an interview yesterday here in german television. This man is amazing, period. He just perfectly knows what he wants and is not afraid to say so.</p>

<p>Just some quotes, from my head.</p>

<p>Question: &quot;Are you afraid of death?&quot;
Answer: &quot;Billions of people have died before me. Billions of people died after me. It can&#8217;t be that bad.&quot;
Question: &quot;But what do you want to be remembered by, do you want a museum or something?&quot;
Answer: &quot;Oh no, I live now, I never followed some great ideal, I just wanted to have a good living. Me starts with me and ends with me. After me the flood.&quot;</p>

<p>Question: &quot;Are there any similarities between you and your sister?&quot;
Answer: &quot;No, not at all. She is a very caring person. She helps the poor and homeless and things. I just help myself. I am very much an egoist.&quot;</p>

<p>Question: &quot;You lost 42 kilos&#8230;&quot; (60 kilos now)
Answer: &quot;I feel very good now, actually, I wear pants that some of the people I work with don&#8217;t fit in. That&#8217;s very funny and conforting. It shouldn&#8217;t be really as it is not important, but you need to get your fun somehow ;)&quot;</p>

<p>Question: &quot;You have 230000 books, what aobout pride in owning them?&quot;
Answer: &quot;I actually don&#8217;t know how many books I have, my computers tell me I have 230000, I never counted them. I read a lot and my favorites are at all my places. Other&#8217;s are just somewhere on call if I want them. I actually don&#8217;t think there is a pride in owning them. Owning something is boring, the collecting is the fun part. Once you have what you wanted to collect it gets boring. [&#8230;] I also think I like paper and that probably runs deep. When I was young, good drawing paper was rare with most of my paper coming over from the US from uncles. They told me to draw on the backside too but I promised myself early on that I would never do that. I also can&#8217;t throw it away. I now have more drawing paper than I could possibly use in more than one lifetime.&quot;</p>

<p>Weird guy, but very shure in what he knows, believes to know and thinks.</p>
