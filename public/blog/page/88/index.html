  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s the idea you get from reading the idea that we are in the times of &quot;Wiki wars&quot;. Oh&#8230;. my &#8230; god &#8230; . We will all die horrible angry deaths because a sub set of a behemoth switched Wikis. So what is this all about? There was <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/columnists/business_extras/10671792.htm?1c">an article</a> on Mercury News telling all that <a href="http://www.jotspot.com/">JotSpot</a> stole away a customer, Disney, from <a href="http://www.socialtext.com/">SocialText</a>. Now Ross <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/winning_the_wik.html">commented</a> and Graham <a href="http://blog.jot.com/archives/2005/01/18/wiki-wars/">commented</a> <a href="http://blog.jot.com/archives/2005/01/18/old-school/">twice</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The undertone of the posts seem to be very definsive and offensive at the same time, especially Ross seems to be going out of his way to make clear that JotSpot does not have as many customers yet, isn&#8217;t open source, isn&#8217;t into the new area of doing business the social way, and so on. From Ross:&lt;em&gt; Jot may think they have won a skirmish against their leading
competitor. But really, its at the cost of their customer, and the only
harm to us is taking my time to write this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Emmm&#8230; what? How come this is at the cost of the customer? Why is it so important to have Disney onboard damn it? Last I tried JotSpot is a very fine Wiki indeed and I am looking forward to seeing it get out of beta. In relation to why JotSpot only has one customer, I presume that&#8217;s just because they are still in beta!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;As Graham mentioned in his entry, SocialText and JotSpot have different value propositions. I highly doubt that JotSpot is really in this for a zero-sum game. The market for Wikis is huge, and I mean huge. There are an amazing number of applications out there and I myself run MediaWiki internall at the moment, just for the sake of showing that there are other options.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;All in all I hope both teams will get along and not get into public fights via their blogs and this is what it seems like at the moment. It&#8217;s hard to loose a customer but that&#8217;s what its about. That&#8217;s business. Listen to your customer. Why did Disney switch? Are you missing a feature they need and does it fit your strategy? If it doesn&#8217;t then you shouldn&#8217;t go after Disney! In any case, as Ross says, this is about the cable network engineering department at Disney!!! That just shows how small the market still is and how big it can become! Now get going developing your applications in the light of what your customers want and stop fighting.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Comment Spam is a big subject in the blog world and now there might be a solution to our pains. While everyone was fighting the comment side, Google came up with a solution to just not make the search side a problem. ;) Comment spam comes from the fact that if you comment and leave a link, it will possibly be followed by Google, indexed faster, and gets a higher PageRank. Now the big ones out there will add a tage to all the links saying &lt;em&gt;re=&quot;nofollow&quot;&lt;/em&gt; which will tell search engine bots that the link should not be followed. Google Blog <a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">has a post</a> about it stating the the search engine and blogger will support it and they also have a list who else will which includes among others (I added a few and left out a few) <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/2005/01/support_for_nof.shtml">Six Apart</a> (for TypePad, MoveableType and LiveJoural [non friends], WordPress, MSN (for <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/msnsearch/archive/2005/01/18/nofollow_tags.aspx">both search and spaces</a>), Yahoo <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000069.html">search</a> and <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1157">Blogg.de</a>. John Battelle already <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001197.php">raised his voice</a> stating that while he loves the idea, he is not sure if it will not have some adverse side effects. This is obviously a hard thing to think about, which is why I agree with him, I am not sure if this will. The conversation might be more broken up, there might be less possibility to find the origin of a conversation. Then again, if I link from within my blog, I will be giving all the pagerank, authority and trust that I can and should be giving. So in this case, I think it is highly likely that this will be very good. But we will see how the comment spam will develop from here on out, at least the <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&amp;amp;url=nofollow">blogosphere is buzzing on nofollow already</a>. In Summary: I like it. Very cool and my congratulations to everyone involved in working on this so cooperatively or at least having no huge discussions about whether some other tag or something else wouldn&#8217;t have been better. Very KISS.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://lumma.de/">Nico</a> just messages me about an article on the Internet Stock Blog entitled <a href="http://www.internetstockblog.com/2005/01/yahoo_lacks_a_b.html">Yahoo to acquire Six Apart?</a>. I do have to comment, partly because I feel it is highly unlikely and because there are some faults in the reasoning.</p>

<p>Their argument: &lt;I&gt;1. Blogs are the next market for pay-per-click ads.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Not true, and Yahoo! knows that. Blogs, especially smaller ones have lots of repeat visitors that are not really perfect for pay per click marketing. There would be the same people over and over again, and on top of that, the opportunity for quasi-clickfraud would be high. I can easily click my ads 3 times a day and somebody else might too and at 50 impressions on an average blog per day, I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s a pretty high ratio of false clicks. On top of that, it&#8217;s not controllable enough. Even with clicks, a lot of the risk is still with the advertiser who wants to know he runs.</p>

<p>By the way, you can also monitor profitability per sale with CPM placements. It&#8217;s just that the prices are too high not that CPC gives you a new opportunity there. And the more money advertisers push into ads in CPC networks is because of the measurement and with that measurement comes a move from the marketing to the sales budget in terms of where the money comes from.</p>

<p>Another one of their points: &lt;I&gt;Overture followed, though it targeted large Web publishers (The Wall Street Journal) instead of automating the sign-up process to make it suitable for millions of small operators as Google did. (Perhaps Yahoo! underestimated the length of the long tail in Web publishing.)&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Overture does know the long tail very well. The problem is that the Overture architecture does not scale in that direction. They need a keyword that queries their engine to give back ads and if you want to run on thousands of blogs, with hundreds of pages, you can&#8217;t have 5000 people attaching keywords to each page anymore. That just doesn&#8217;t scale. You could allow the users to attach keywords themselves, allowing them to just increase their revenue per placement but that would go against the idea that is the founding principle of Overture. Targeted ads based on the choosing of the advertiser. Once they move away from search it is no longer the choosing of the advertiser but the choosing of Overture&#8217;s sales staff.</p>

<p>Another point: &lt;I&gt;Skeptical? Don&#8217;t be. TypePad has already integrated the Amazon.com associates program into its TypeLists, and announced in November that it was partnering with contextual ad provider Kanoodle. It&#8217;s only a matter of time before Google does the same with Blogger.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>All TypePad did is allow me to give them my Amazon Associate ID and any book will be linked with that ID. Nothing special. Nothing really Integration there. But the point that it is possible to automatically give me some advertisement accounts is good and if Six Apart goes in a livetime value approach here allows companies like Kanoodle to integrate themselves into TypePad, then they can make a real kicker in money.</p>

<p>A very good point in relation to blogging platforms: &lt;I&gt;Yahoo! has&#8230; nothing.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Ok, there I give it to the article. It does have a point there :) Oh, and yes there is a solution to advertising in a blog world. :)</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;2. Web publishing will be a necessary component of an integrated set of Web-based personal tools.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;[&#8230;] MSN and Google will probably roll-out their own Web-based RSS-aggregators soon.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>I presume one of them will buy Bloglines.</p>

<p>The Ubertool that follows is a nice idea and I think the company that will really succeed there is one that allows things to be integrated, which is where Yahoo! is doing well. Maybe they really do not need blogs, because they can integrate all the content for the users and the advertising dollars are there, not on the blogs themselves. Ok, there too but not only.</p>

<p>Another point: &lt;I&gt;Why won&#8217;t Yahoo! just build its own blogging platform? First, because the serious blogs with the most readers - and thus the greatest PPC ad potential - have already been built with Blogger, TypePad or Movable Type. And second, because Yahoo! is far behind Google and Microsoft, and acquiring Six Apart would vault it to the front.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think the serious blogs are already gone, but all in all, it is correct that it would potentially be good for Yahoo! You can just calculate a bit, saying that each of the users that Six Apart now has is worth an average of $100 (just an assumption via 2 years of fees or ads or something), and hence, Six Apart is worth $650 Million. Wohooo :)</p>

<p>Some minor things that would need further thought in the article but all in all,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           a <a href="http://www.internetstockblog.com/2005/01/yahoo_lacks_a_b.html">very good read</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of stories showing that the right measurement is important, that market valuation is not a simple calculation of tangible assets, or that showing new measurements are used to give further insight in the organization. All this is related to the term intellectual capital, which has been defined in many ways. It is about those intangible assets that do not show up on financial statements but can be codified, valued and managed by the company. It might be knowledge of people that is important to a company. Or it can be said to be the combination of patents, processes, skills, about stakeholders of a company. Economists define it simply as Tobin&#8217;s-q.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;The principles of intellectual capital&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The concern with intellectual capital comes from different sources:
- a more accurate valuation of intangible inputs increase market efficiency through more appropriate flows of capital
- new measurements provide managers with a clearer picture
- to guide future strategy like accounting systems do&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accuracy in valuations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Brand valuation, goodwill, human assets accounting are all subjects brought forward in the discussion about truly valueing a company. Still there is a difference between book and market value of companies.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Goodwill on the books is also only what was paid for another company above book value, calculated via &quot;fair&quot; value of the underlying assets. Intangible assets can be valued by accountants by finding out their market value. The difference between what the accountant then says the company is worth and what you pay is goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The difference between accounting data and share prices has increased over the last 30 years as more value is attached to intangible assets that cannot be monetized. Data from 1992 suggests that 40% of the value of a company is missing from the books, something that is subscribed to intellectual capital assets by some.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Tobin&#8217;s q is a measurement of that really in that it calculates the ratio between market and book value. But the market value is more about investor attitude towards the value of the firm than an objectifiable value. Bubbles on the stock market are still happening even though we know they exist and the collapse of confidence brought forward by investors. Once some speculators cash in, it might create a panic and the bubble bursts. This then turns out to be a self-reinforcing process. Can we remove that bubble with good intellectual capital accounting?&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Internal efficiencies are another thing driving intellectual capital measurement. Companies want to be worth more or know what they are worth at least. Some studies seem to show that an increase in published R&amp;D expenditure increases market value. Another link seems to be between expenditure on advertising and market value. These costs seem to lead to a reaction that would suggest and increase in assets instead of costs.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In that, companies need to manage all their assets including knowledge. The better you measure all your assets, the more easily you detect opportunities and all allocate resources better. This I actually buy into. You can also measure to read a goal, meaning that you look at where you stand and if your base is capable of supporting you in reaching your goal.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So what drives intellectual capital measurement:
- Market inefficiencies
- Internal inefficiencies
- Measurement to reach goals&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;We can then group intellectual capital into some categories:
- knowledge
- information
- communication
- human resources
- brands
- copyright
- patents
- systems&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Roos and Roos identify a three-stop process:
- nurturing an intellectual capital language
- identifying intellectual capital indicators
- developing an intellectual capital report&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You might not agree to all of this but one thing that is sire is that current performance measurement is sub-optimal to predict future financial performance. Strategic decisions need full information, which is not anything new really. The link of IC to market value should now be clear though.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The language of intellectual capital&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The vocabulary is important to make the areas of focus and concern clear. The process to build the vocabulary should be continuous, being fitted and refitted to your necessary focus and concern. There are some intellectual capital methods that can be noted:
- Kaplan and Norton&#8217;s Balanced Scorecard
- Skandia&#8217;s Navigator
- Karl Sveiby&#8217;s Intangible Asset Monitor
- The IC Index&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;They often are similar in their categories of concern:
- human capital
- infrastructure
- intellectual property
- franchise value / customer capital
- renewal and development
- process
- &#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In the end the areas of concern need to be indicators of future performance. Financial measurement as sales show past performance. Customer loyalty or satisfaction might show future performance. An intellectual capital language is looking at future performance. There are several areas of concern that might be a good starting point:
- Information sharing because good capacity means good ability to re-use
- Networks, communication &amp; and innovation (e.g. 3M)
- Intellectual property
- Brands
- Talent/Human resources&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;These are again just examples though.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In summary, you need three steps. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Broadly define intellectual capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify subgrouped areas of concern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify elements that contribute to future success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;It must be pointed out that even though you find a potential element it might not contribute to the company intellectual capital. In a sense you might have to move back from 3 to 2 for further discussion and re-evaluation. The process should never end.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measureing Intellectual Capital&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the root up: Find your concerns and then ask those at the core how they should be measured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recap: a) Nurture IC language. b) Identify IC indicators. c) Develop IC Report&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intro to measures: Many measures will not be monetary but they might be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discounted Cash Flow: Patents and Copyrights are often valued like that, via future cash flows discounted by a discount factors, which can still be wrong though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monetary Measures: e.g. amount spent on training, R&amp;D expenditure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ratio Measures: This gives a relative performance indicator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absolute Numbers: Number of scientists for example. But there needs to be a sound justification for exactly that number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subjective: More used to augment a measure. Do you find working here a pleasant experience rated between 1 and 5 can best be used to support another measure but not as the only one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a new method: In the financial market you always compare, yet here you are only looking inside which might mean that it is respected too much outside the organization as a measure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Examples of measurement methods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Skyrme argued that these systems are currently in a stage of evolution, being refined over time.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The balanced scorecard
It was introduced 1992 in an HBR article by Kaplan and Norton based on a year-long study at 12 companies. There are four perspectives: financial, customer, internal business, innovation and learning. They are often interlinked, influencing each other and need to be based on areas of focus and concern. The main idea is that you put control of vision and strategy while implementation is done by others. It focusses on the drivers or lead indicators of future performance. Some examples are on page 40 of the book or likely to be found all over the net.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Skandia Navigator
Skandia, the swedish financial services company, is one of the leaders in IC measurement. If I remember correctly they are also on the forefront of a move to remove budgets totally. Anyway, they look at: financial, customer, human, process, and &#8216;renewal and development&#8217;. the human focus is at the center with the systems there to help managers figure out their appropriate measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are only very few measures in their system but they have been refined over a long period. Skandia believes the measurement system shows how Skandia can create financial capital from intellectual capital. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The intangible assets monitor
Karl Eric Sveiby developed it, designating four categories of concern:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal structure: patents, concepts, models, systems, &#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External structure: relationships, brands, trademarks, reputation, &#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Individual&quot; competence: employee ability to act, skills, education, experience, eq, &#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Competence belongs to be individual he believes but the company cannot be conceived without people. Each of these categories is then measured to see whether it aids stability, efficiency, or growth and renewal. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The IC Index
GÃ¶ran and Roos combine some larger focus areas into an &quot;efficiency&quot; index. Different areas of focus are combined to form an index. Some examples are on page 44.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Additional points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The report needs to include the following:
- How did IC become important to use
- How does it fit our objectives
- Explanation of areas of concern
- Measures in tables and charts&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The reader of a company report needs to be introduced to the specific measures as they are very specific to the company. The idea is that if the measures are accurate (financial reporting is a science too), the market will reward it and become more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then you also need to assess the need. It is certain that regulatory bodies like the SEC will require more IC accounting as standard account is only showing the past. Several studies show that the benefits outweigh the costs.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Steward actually believes that utilizing your intellectual capital means exploiting the &quot;free-floating brainpower&quot; of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Critique of ICM Programs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is merely repackaging of managing people (Boudreau)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we already have benchmarking, competence models, business worth, &#8230; all the other reports that are similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can the data really correspond to the question? Sample bias, missing data, the difference between correlation and causation, playing the numbers, &#8230; all play a role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power (1994) raised the question whether any audit system is not flawed and only uses up valuable resources. This is because the data can easily be misinterpreted, because of the increase of likelihood of group think, becoming entrenched in the numbers and whether that what is audited is really important of whether something else is not simply missed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Context of the auditor matters and might be unfit. What, how and if something is audited is influence by the receivers of the audit. There is likely one way. And who audits the auditors?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential for fraudulent behavior is big (playing the numbers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;This <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/who_the_hell_is.html">Gasoil Inc</a> <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/who_could_gasoi.html">thing</a> is confusing me more and more. I tried to look again and just found out that <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/t/80/5092.html">Brin&#8217;s sales plan</a> bought 481,113 GASO.OB shares in the non open market for $0 per share and sold them again on the same day for $85 netting him $40,894,605. Either he still has the same number of shares still now or the current page is off. 24th of August is also the date Eric Schmidt sold his shares in Gasoil Inc, with the same number still listed on the page: He bought for $0 twice and then sold again for $85, giving him once $24,079,905 and once $7,282,120. I didn&#8217;t calculate it exactly but that seems to be more than his current sales of Google stock, though I might be wrong. Wayne Rosing came out of whatever this is with $5,962,665. Larry Page got $41,005,275. When I looked at this some time ago I thought they were still holding that stock but that doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case. They all made millions in one day. Oh, did I tell you that the 24th was just 5 days after the IPO on the 19th? Google was trading at <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=GOOG&amp;amp;a=07&amp;amp;b=18&amp;amp;c=2004&amp;amp;d=07&amp;amp;e=24&amp;amp;f=2004&amp;amp;g=d">$104.87 on that day</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Now lets look at <a href="http://eol.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_html/2004/08/16/0001193125-04-141838.html">the SEC filing for the Google IPO</a>. Ok, didn&#8217;t find anything in there about Gasoil Inc.. Somebody please enlighten me what happened? Who bought all those shares for that one price? Where are they now? Does Google now own hundreds of thousands of shares of Gasoil Inc? Did Google maybe buy Gasoil Inc? If they did, would they have to publish that? It actually sounds like it would be fully legal. I mean the Google founders can decide what they want due to how the Google shares are made up. Can this be what I have been looking for? Is this an amazingly clever plot to cash out early? Am I drawing too dark an image? Again, please enlighten me!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/02/what_gasoil_inc.html">What Gasoil Inc is</a> &#8230; the solution. :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
