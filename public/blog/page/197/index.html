<p>There  are a lot of financial stakeholders and the following could be a good list.</p>

<ol>
<li>Internal
a)  Managers: stewardship (the need to protect the organisationâ€™s
possessions); planning; control; decision making.
b)  Employees
c)  Owners</li>
<li>External
a)  Funding bodies and owners
b)  Owners
c)  Lenders of money
d)  Suppliers of goods and services
e)  Customers and clients
f)  Governments agencies
g)  The general public</li>
</ol>


<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>The inputs-outputs model is used a lot to describe that managers need to transform resources (inputs) into goods and services (outputs) that result in outcomes (happy customers, profits, satisfied users, and so on). These inputs and outputs all have monetary values.</p>

<p>You can split up inputs into:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tangible assets (resources you can see and touch)
a) short-term, day to day, e.g. cash, consumables, materials
b) long-term, e.g. equipment, vehicles, land, buildings</li>
<li>Intangible assets (people and know-how)</li>
</ol>


<p>Internal budgetary information tracks input consumption and output performance for both planning and reporting back. You can use standard planning and feedback budget pro forma.</p>

<p>You also to do external stakeholder accounting which is done through balance sheets, profit statements / profit and loss accounts, cash flow statements. Traditionally the sources for finance for inputs are called liabilities (fixed and current, while current means under a year repayable), and what the business spends money on is called its assets (long term assets = fixed assets; short term assets = current assets).</p>

<p>Balance sheets reveal to stakeholders where the financial resources in an organisation have come from and how they are used at a particular time.</p>

<p>The profit and loss statement is not made up of cash transactions alone (e.g. server only deducted 50% per year). Cash flow statements just record cash in and out.</p>

<p>The profit and loss accounts reveal the difference between income and expenditure, the gross profit and operating profit, how resources were used and what happened to any profit or surplus.</p>

<p>Annual reports provide information explaining organisationsâ€™ results and also evidence of the veracity of their financial statements.</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You have an internal environment in your company as well as a near external (clients, suppliers, â€¦) and the far external which is STEEP:
-   Social
-   Technological
-   Economic
-   Environmental
-   Political&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You can control the internal, influence the near and respond to the far external environment. Remember that these boundaries are not fixed but they can move dependant on outsourcing, internal happenings, world-wide changes, â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders are people/groups with a legitimate interest in the activities of your company. They can:
-   be internal or external
-   have different and possibly conflicting interests
-   feature certain groups who are likely to be dominant.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Morgan (1988) emphasized the importance of anticipating change and being proactive rather than reactive with your environment. You might not be in a position to influence your companies response to an external environment change but understanding the changing environment can help you manage your company.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Factors: Demographic changes, patterns of work, household structure, patterns of consumption, gender roles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technological Factors: lowering barriers of time and place, creates new industries, nature of internal services has been transformed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic Factors: growth rate, interest rate, inflation, energy prices, exchange rates, unemployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environmental Factors: legislation, information, employees, shareholders, pressure groups, customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Political Factors: legislations, trading relationships, government as customer, level and nature of public services, governments in commercial sectors, regulation, permissions, taxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Several forecasting techniques exist. Such as:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extrapolation; extension of an existing trend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market research; both quantitative and qualitative information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judgement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scenarios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Remember. Models are there to improve understanding, stats cannot judge, when no forecasting possible then monitor, judgements need objectivity or they are too optimistic, never do single-point-forecasts, you are never 100% correct.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Everybody has customers, just broaden the horizon of them.</p>

<p>There are special relationships:</p>

<ul>
<li>Non-Commercial organisations: funded by government ; people who receive service do not pay directly, but indirectly. Customers: Service users, government, taxpayers</li>
<li>Voluntary organisations: not even indirect payment; Customers: service users, donors or funders, volunteer staff.</li>
<li>B2b organisations: not to individuals but to organisations. Customers: a lot.</li>
<li>Internal services: normally no customer pays but do not have a choice of another provider of service.</li>
<li>Customers and consumers: If you buy food you normally do not eat it alone. Make the distinction.</li>
</ul>


<p>All customers and suppliers are different. To visualize complex supplier-customer relationships represent the organisation as a chain.</p>

<p>Paretoâ€™s Law states 80 per cent of the effects in a system arise from 20 per cent of the causes.</p>

<p>You should think of marketing as the creation and distribution of customers and satisfaction for an appropriate return on resources and effort. It has to be customer-centered or is nothing and it takes 6 times more money to generate a new customer than it does to keep an old one.</p>

<p>The market mix, when viewed with the 4Ps model looks like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Product: what is being marketed</li>
<li>Price: how much cost to whom</li>
<li>Place: distribution system, where</li>
<li>Promotion: communication with actual and potential customers</li>
</ul>


<p>This is seller oriented and you can also use the 4Cs model which is more customer oriented started by the Committee of Marketing Organisations (COMO).</p>

<ul>
<li>Customersâ€™ needs and wants: use market research, forecasting, new product development, product management and budgeting</li>
<li>Costs to the customer: pricing policy</li>
<li>Customer convenience: distribution</li>
<li>Communicating with customers: sales management, advertising, sales promotion</li>
</ul>


<p>You need to understand your customers which, when done well, can help you serve customersâ€™ needs better. Market research involves distributing as well as collecting formal and informal information about customers. Sources can be secondary (from existing sources) or primary (formally commissioned studies).</p>

<p>When communicating with customers try to identify the group you want to talk to, then define the message you want to communicate and finally select the medium for communication.</p>

<p>It is always helpful to use segmentation to divide customers in groups with some common characteristics.</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Organisations need structure or they would just be a crowd of individuals and this structure is often equated with bureaucracy but downsizing and greater flexibility are in fashion at the moment. But:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;â€œWe cannot decide whether to have a structured or a structure less group; only whether or not to have a formally structured one.ï¿½? (Freeman, 1972)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Arguments for clear and public structure:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enabling participation: the rules generally enable people to find their way around, co-ordinate activity, make decisions and participate in the organisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing a framework for the allocation of responsibilities and authority: The more appropriate the structure, the more effective the working relationships between individuals and departments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establishing an organisationâ€™s identity: structure conveys a message about the values and character of the organisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuity and change: bring order into chaos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Child (1984) suggested that there are recurring symptoms within organisations, results of â€˜structural deficienciesâ€™. There is no one size fits all structure. The challenge is to develop a structure that recognizes what is required while still achieving an efficient use of resources and providing effective services to customers.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In terms of organising work, Burns and Stalker (1961) broke down organisations in the mechanistic type and the organismic type.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You need to divide up work, possibly with specialisation and define a job in terms of allowable inputs and expected outputs, without having to specify what goes on in between.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Organisation chars reveal key elements of a structure:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the span of control (how many do you control directly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the layers of management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the degree of autonomy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the extent of specialisation (expert or routine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the extent of overlap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reporting processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Forms of organisational structure include:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;functional&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;product or service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geographic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;project team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;matrix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hybrid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;To achieve co-ordination, you need something like:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rules, programmes and procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remits and referrals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setting targets and goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating slack resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating self-contained tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investment in vertical information systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating lateral relations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Remember that information, especially processing and distribution, is crucial to effective integration/management.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Beware of:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any one ideal structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sudden switches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reactions to the terminology of structural issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trying to achieve perfection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>An understanding of organisation culture is important because it defines the framework within which you have to manage and work. But it is difficult to define what a culture really is. Some say it is â€œwhat the organisation is really like when no oneâ€™s looking.ï¿½? Or â€œthe way things happen around hereï¿½?.</p>

<p>Culture is important and successful companies have cultures in which people want to work and to succeed.</p>

<p>Cultures are not rules or formal and can differ from the defined one.</p>

<p>the collection of traditions, values, policies, beliefs, and attitudes that constitute a pervasive context for everything we do and think in an organisation. (LcLean and Marshall, 1993).</p>

<p>Recognise that what you see on the surface is based on a much deeper reality.</p>

<p>Trice and Beyer (1984) suggest the use of symbols. High-profile symbols are those designed to create an external image. Trice and Beyer suggest that there are 4 categories for low-profile symbols:</p>

<ul>
<li>practices: rites, rituals and ceremonies.</li>
<li>Communications: stories, myths, sagas, legends, fold tales, symbols and slogans.</li>
<li>Physical forms: building, floor plan, flipcharts or whiteboards, casual or tie â€¦</li>
<li>A common language: jargon. â€œcrew membersï¿½? â€¦</li>
</ul>


<p>Handy considered culture in terms of shared rules of behaviour:</p>

<ul>
<li>power/club culture: personality is more important than formal structuresâ€¦; organisation important.</li>
<li>task culture: work as problem solving, people relying on their concerted abilities to deal with new situations; organisation important</li>
<li>person culture: people first, org. second and just means to an end.</li>
<li>role culture: individuals are role occupants; formal; certainty, predictability, continuity and stability is important.</li>
</ul>


<p>But attention, culture evolves over time.</p>

<p>You need to understand your clientâ€™s cultures too.</p>

<p>Negotiated cultures says that through their inputs people construct and create an individual and a shared sense of organisational identity. There will always be a variety of cultures and subcultures in any organisation. Therefore, as of this theory, a company does not have a culture but a cultures is something more fluid, influenced and shares and created by everyone involved.</p>

<p>Cultural Change programs, often coming from a view that current behaviour of the organisation and its staff does not match the demands of its external environment, happen in four stages:
1.  review external environment and current culture to see mismatch
2.  develop a model culture for the external environment (total quality, customer-focused, user-centered, â€¦)
3.  programme of action, to develop the desired culture
4.  embedding the new culture</p>

<p>It is not that easy though. Hendry and Hope identified for problems with cultural change:</p>

<ol>
<li>resilience of the existing organisational culture: outsiders may see the need for change but employees may not. Itâ€™s like persuading someone that they need to change their character</li>
<li>complexity of culture change: informal processes, rituals, power structures and behaviours cannot be changed by dictate or in isolation from each other.</li>
<li>contradictions in the desired culture: managers want control but they really would like to have autonomy, creativity and innovation.</li>
<li>mismatches between individual and organisational values: people need to genuinely trust, respect and support their organisationâ€™s behaviour.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>How do organisational and personal values as well as ethics affect the management. You need to ensure compliance with the mission, values and ethics of your organisation.</p>

<p>We learn the values of our family, community and society we live in    (normative system) Our values are split up by the SOGI (Society, Organisation, Group, Individual) acronym. Different sets of values may apply at each of the SOGI levels which is the result of conflict (Society  Organisation; Group  Individual; Individual  Organisation;â€¦).</p>

<p>An organisation builds a hierarchy which goes from:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why? â€“ Mission and Values â€“ Why do we exist?</li>
<li>What? â€“ Aims or Goals â€“ What are we trying to do?</li>
<li>(What/How)? â€“ Objectives â€“ How will we do it?</li>
<li>How? - Targets</li>
</ol>


<p>Mission and values are often put into so called missions statements (credo).</p>

<p>Creating this can help because:</p>

<ul>
<li>process is valuable in itself to identify the fundamental reasons why an organisation exists.</li>
<li>Assist in communications between org. and stakeholders</li>
<li>Helps decision making</li>
<li>Provides a yardstick against which the org. can be evaluated.</li>
</ul>


<p>It should address:
-   Why does the org. exist?
-   What are its aims?
-   Who is it for?
-   Where does it operate â€“ internationally/nationally/locally?
-   How should it pursue its aims?</p>

<p>There is always a difference between group and individual ethics and managers have to balance the need to get work done or control costs with the need to meet professional standards. It is helpful first of all to identify the role you are playing when seeking to manage disputes and you should pay attention to draw the line between private and public matters.</p>

<p>Miller (1999) suggested the following for managing ethics issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Establish a written ethics policy</li>
<li>Set an example</li>
<li>Instruct by means of case studies</li>
<li>Reward ethical performance</li>
<li>Encourage social responsibility</li>
</ul>


<p>There might be problems with competing pressures but some things just need to be done right.</p>

<p>Thomas and Ely (1996) looked at managing diversity where several perspectives are most common:</p>

<ul>
<li>Discrimination and fairness: Very bureaucratic in structure; staff gets diversified but work does not; â€œwe are all the sameï¿½?; problem: important differences between people cannot count.</li>
<li>Access and legitimacy: acceptance and celebration of differences; motivated by market share and commercial advantage.</li>
<li>Learning and effectiveness: capture benefits of both the other approaches; all in the same team with their differences, not despite them.</li>
</ul>


<p>Managers also need to pay attention to whistle blowing â€“ workers exposing wrong-doing in their organisation. It can be good and bad.</p>

<p>As a manager, you have to make an assessment of the things you can change, the things you cannot change and, as an old saying goes, â€˜pray for the wisdom to know the differenceâ€™.</p>

<p>There is no substitute for listening to people, trying to clarify issues and working out agreed standard of behaviour. To do this effectively Lawton (1998) suggests you need to understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>context: what is legal? What are the values of society? What is expected?</li>
<li>The formal organisation: rules of behaviour? Accountability? Responsibility? Core values?</li>
<li>The informal organisation: subgroup values? Where is the power? Different management practices? Cultures and traditions?</li>
</ul>


<p>He emphasises the need for the ability to assess the way in which power is exercised in an organisation. Baddeley and James (1990) suggest two dimensions from self-oriented to acting-with-integrity and from politically-unaware to politically-aware.</p>

<ul>
<li>inept: politically ignorant and lacking integrity</li>
<li>innocent: politically ignorant but full of integrity</li>
<li>clever: politically astute but self-serving</li>
<li>wise: politically astute and full of integrity</li>
</ul>


<p>What is important is that manoeuvring and negotiating through the differences of opinions, power and personality in organisations are legitimate components of management. What matters is the motive and integrity behind them.</p>

<p>This is about what of and why corporations exist as well as how they work.</p>

<p>We are organisation people and the organisation where we work has most influence over our life but they also mean different things for different people and one view is not necessarily better than the other.</p>

<p>But organisations enable objectives to be achieved that could not be achieved by the efforts of individuals on their own and have three factors in common: people, objectives and structure.</p>

<p>You need to unite all the people by creating some kind of identity through purpose and co-ordinate their work and split it up at the same time.</p>

<p>Mintzberg and Van der Heyden created a dynamic understanding of organisations where structure is relatively stable and unchanging, whereas process refers to the faster-moving events that happen against the backdrop of the structure. Structure and process are interconnected and interdependent and at the same time formal and informal.</p>

<p>More recently quantum theory or rather chaos theory has been used to suggest the unpredictability of organisational life.</p>

<p>Although it can be helpful to view organisations as rational machines, capable of being diagnosed part by part and finely tuned, this is a limited view because organisations are also communities â€“ inherently amorphous and changing as their component parts (that is, the people involved) and their environments change.</p>

<p>Differentiation and Integration is important, which is the same for all corporations. As animals become more complex they need to differentiate their cells and as the organisation grows it becomes harder to specialists to keep contact with others, resulting in the need for integrative mechanisms.</p>

<p>Lawrence and Lorsch (1967) asked why people build organisations and found that organisations enable people to find better solutions to the challenges of their environment. But:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is people who have purposes or goals, not organisations</li>
<li>People have to come together to co-ordinate their different activities and thus create and organisations.</li>
<li>The effectiveness depends on whether people are satisfied by their planned transactions within their environment (sub-unit)</li>
</ul>


<p>The more you differentiate the more you need to integrate appropriately! And differentiations is important as you need to incorporate very different perspectives and concerns (not everyone should think like production staff).</p>

<p>Organisations need a purpose and identity where Paton (1991) sees differences between sectors.</p>

<ul>
<li>Commercial organisations =&gt; logic of profit</li>
<li>Public sector =&gt; logic of accountability</li>
<li>Social economy =&gt; logic of commitment (what needs to be done)</li>
</ul>


<p>Organisational purposes are achieved by the strategic orientation to the outside world that an organisation adopts. And we are moving towards network organisations where instead of differentiation there are partnerships of several organisations. This can go as far as a virtual organisation.</p>

<p>All organisations are different is something else that is important.</p>

<ul>
<li>size and life-cycle (birth, youth, midlife, maturity)</li>
<li>location</li>
<li>use of technology</li>
</ul>


<p>Diagrams can help understand an organisations: Organigrams (an organisations in action).</p>

<p>Mintzberg and Van der Heyden argue that the traditional organisational chart with the managers on top has had a debilitating effect and gives managers a misleading perception of themselves.</p>

<ul>
<li>sets of people doing their own thing.</li>
<li>Chains of connected activities in a process</li>
<li>Hubs of activities around a manager</li>
<li>Webs of fluid relationships and actions</li>
</ul>


<p>Managing itself is everywhere, facilitating collaboration, energising the whole network, encouraging people who already do their job well.</p>

<p>To cope better with your organisation:</p>

<ul>
<li>The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. (helicopter view)</li>
<li>Complex and multiple interrelationships</li>
<li>Reframing (visualise some other way to see new ways)</li>
<li>Creating maps and models</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This is about the second part of the entire decision making loop, monitoring and evaluating the performance of those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Monitoring is about what is happening. It is clearly a part of the process of evaluation, but it is not the whole picture. Evaluation seeks to assess how well the path was executed.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;If you need to control something always put the control on the task, not on the people.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In terms of monitoring and objectives you should try to avoid standards that are open to interpretation to make them SMART. Ideally, they would also be meaningful, clear, fair, adjustable, honoured.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Monitoring is often associated with the gathering of information for control which can be done by:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Involvement and observation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular reporting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exception reporting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questioning and discussion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Records and routing statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Next the Information you have gathered needs to be interpreted and you must take action upon that. Understand why something happened and the revise the standard or target or modify the activities or continue as is.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;If you have control, you need to exercise it and this is what we call evaluation. Evaluation is about finding out whether you are achieving what you set out to achieve, and where and how things could be improved. You should continuously look for ways to improve, never settling down.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The process of evaluation is iterative, meaning you are going through the processes repeatedly.
1.  Asking questions (-&gt; Monitoring)
2.  Answering questions (-&gt; Review)
3.  Drawing conclusions (-&gt; Assessment)
4.  Making necessary changes&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Evaluation will highlight any differences in goals, values or objectives that exist in an organisation and force them to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of evaluations as performance evaluation (are targets met), process evaluation (how do we work), impact evaluation (whether outcomes are achieved), strategic evaluation (doing the right thing), composite evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;How do we design a formal evaluation? We take this from McCollam and White from 1993:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Define project aims -&gt; Define purposes of evaluation -&gt; Determine focus and audience -&gt; Specify timescale -&gt; Describe the work of the project â€“ (possibly go back to defining the purpose) -&gt; Choose evaluator -&gt; Select Methods  Collect Information -&gt; Analyse and write up results -&gt; Use results internally â€“ (possibly go back to 1) -&gt; Disseminate them externally.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The type of the evaluation depends on its focus and the balance between quantitative (measurable, results speak for themselves) and qualitative (reason behind everything) information is important.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then you need to analyse and report the results. You need to look at your data looking for evidence relating to the achievement of your objectives, patterns in the evidence and unexpected results. Remember that analysis takes time and remember to write for the people that read it and make the report look good.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then you need to make use of the results and disseminate the findings and if the evaluation results in changes to be made, then you will need to plan their implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are some issues to consider. Conflict can result out of discovered differences of expectations between groups, as slack is never popular and so isnâ€™t a manager that makes savings, finding inefficiencies can result in some conflict too. Remember, 20% of the activities you do each day take 80% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Over-commitment is another important thing when activities are taken on without the necessary resources. It might be better to close down an entire unit then to cut everyoneâ€™s expenses.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Collusion means that people present misleading pictures of things important to your research if they feel threatened.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There might also be resistance to findings. Therefore you need to make the stakeholders feel involved and consulted from the start. Those people intimately involved need to be able to reflect on the findings and and you need to consider long-term changes.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>In essence this part is about â€œmaking things happenâ€?. It should help set a plan and ensure that it is followed.</p>

<p>You need a control loop:</p>

<p>Set Objectives -&gt; Plan, identify markers and carry out tasks -&gt; Monitor progress -&gt; Act on results of monitoring (from there adjust tasks or do nothing or revise objectives)</p>

<p>To identify the tasks efficiently, several different techniques can be used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mindmaps</li>
<li>Task Breakdown Chart</li>
</ul>


<p>If you want to display these tasks and put them in a specific sequence, other tools should be used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gantt chart (a form of bar chart)</li>
<li>Network Analysis aka critical path analysis</li>
<li>Key events list</li>
</ul>


<p>Next you need to monitor the progress by involvement and observation or regular reporting or exception reporting or questioning and discussion or by keeping records and routing statistics.</p>

<p>Monitoring without acting on the results is obviously stupid, so you need to either revise the objectives, make changes to tasks or do nothing.</p>

<p>All this is a learning process and you should reflect on what you are doing to improve the planning next time.</p>

<p>Next we need to deal with complexity, which means that the context in which we do our planning is changeable and complicated. Things are not simple.</p>

<p>It is only when you begin planning and assessing the work involved that the feasibility of objectives and timescales becomes apparent. You need to plan ahead:</p>

<ul>
<li>Potential Problem Analysis (What could go wrong?, How likely is it? How serious could it be? -&gt; Prevent)</li>
<li>Contingency planning (What if â€¦?; where could extra resources be optioned; which are the serious dates; know your plan; keep people informed; learn; get more detail; overlap; pre-empt problems; leave some slack; bring tasks forward)</li>
</ul>


<p>If you have a tight timescale then you should try not to think in absolutes. Do the tasks be in that set order or can some be brought forward? Overlapping tasks. Cark and Fujimoto showed in 1991 that Japanese firms too 20% less time than British ones because of that model.</p>

<p>Good communication is key!</p>

<p>This actually warrants more points to be made. Think from all points of view, who will loose? What can you do to make them happy?</p>

<p>Use a communication matrix to do that and expand on is as you learn more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)</p>

<p>How are decisions made and can we do a structured approach on them?</p>

<p>Past decisions as well as future ones will effect the ones we make today. We are concerned with the process that begins with recognition of the need to make a decision, establishing the outcome and identifies the choices as well as the consequences.</p>

<p>A structured approach to making decisions would be the following:</p>

<p>1.) identification and definition
a.  Drucker (1955) commented: â€œThe most common source of mistakes in management decisions is the emphasis on finding the right answer rather than the right questions.â€?
2.) Setting objectives (SMART)
3.) Optional appraisal and decision making
a.  Once the decision has been made it is important to document it to provide an accurate record.
b.  Pay attention to: financials, risk, resources
c.  Identify uncertainties
d.  User experience and computer models to predict probability
4.) Communication and implementation
5.) Monitoring and control</p>

<p>There are several limitations of the structured approach and one that is already mentioned a lot is that managers have to be satisficing!</p>

<p>de Bono (1982) has some ideas to get around the problems like execution speed.</p>

<ul>
<li>A modified structured approach (simplify)</li>
<li>A less than ideal approach (but as close as possible. Visualise ideal)</li>
<li>An intuitive approach (decide intuitive and then justify, then do)</li>
<li>A negative approach (factor out bad solutions)</li>
<li>A changing circumstances approach (forecast)</li>
</ul>


<p>There are several techniques to help you find new ways for better solutions.</p>

<p>Lateral thinking is about freeing your mind to be stimulated into unpredictable and unaccustomed flights of imagination. All judgement should be suspended until a lot of ideas have been generated.</p>

<p>A very similar approach to this would be brainstorming which should allow your brain to work more freely than usual where the idea-generation stage is separated from the evaluation-stage. The wildest idea technique within this, described by Rawlinson (1981), takes one or two of the most off-beat and possibly senseless ideas trying to turn them into useful ones, generating even more ideas. Another more structured approach would be to give everyone a ticket so everyone has their turn or do it in four stages (Define, Redefine for new perspective, generate ideas, evaluate ideas). Brainstorming can be very complex and not easy to apply. Everybody in the team needs to be very open and members of the group should bring in different experiences and expertises.</p>

<p>On we go with lists (Advantages, Disadvantages), Matrices (2 dimensions with different choices and what is a criteria), Decision Tree (where do I really make them), Cause and effect diagrams (fishbone diagram)</p>
