  <div class="entry-content"><p>Betrand seems to be really taking off in respect to semantic blogging. I have read lots of interesting posts by him in the last few weeks and sadly didn&#8217;t have to time to go through them in depth.  Now he posted about <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/bertrand/diary/?id=274">mapping the blog world</a> and I know he has gone far with this. Just check out his <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/bertrand/diary/">diary</a> to see all the fun stuff he has been up to. Just take a look <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/bertrand/diary/?id=270">here</a> for updates on unconstraint relations ala tags. Very cool. Also check out his post on <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/bertrand/diary/?id=249">Semantic blogging engine v 0.2</a>, which gives you some ideas of how he uses trackback to get these things connected. All in all very cool. Please go on Bertrand. This is getting more interesting by the day, even if we haven&#8217;t chatted yet. Take a look at <a href="http://www.sxip.com/">Sxip</a> for authentication maybe. Ok&#8230; it&#8217;s getting weird again, I am talking to people through the blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230; and $10 Million at that! From August Capital. A lot more stuff of interest was posted <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/10/six_apart_serie.shtml">here by Mena</a>. Congratulations to the team! Really wonderful to see you grow. The team is amazing and I know you have somebody that truely believes in the team when I see <a href="http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2004/000897.html">this post by David</a>. While I am at it, congratulations to <a href="http://www.hebig.com/">Heiko</a> for getting TypeBlog.de out of beta and moved to <a href="http://www.sixapart.de/">www.sixapart.de</a>, which really means to me that you are now fully and unremovably Mr. Six Apart Germany, which is very nice to see.</p>

<p>All in all a few great announcements. But I do wonder a little bit about the $10 Million. I presume that this values the company somewhere between $30 Million and $100 Million. A steep value, because it needs to go up by 40% per year or close to that until a buyout or IPO.  I do believe in blogging big time, and I think some from the team of Six Apart know that, but boy, this is a valuation &#8230; I bow my head for those taking part in the negotiation. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have just received word that <a href="http://www.jotspot.com/">JotSpot</a> has just been officially launched at Web 2.0 (it doesn&#8217;t show on the site yet ;)). There is already an article on Business Week right here: &lt;a title=&quot;Do-It-Yourself Software for All?&quot; href=&quot;http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2004/tc2004106_2351.htm?chan=db&quot;&gt;Do-It-Yourself Software for All?&lt;/a&gt;. JotSpot is the Wiki I got demoed by Joe Kraus some time ago but could only <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/09/wiki_and_then_s.html">hint at</a>. I have been using the system for some time now and still very much like it. Congratulations to the team behind it. Looking forward to seeing people talk about it.</p>

<p>The very interesting stuff, next to it being a nice Wiki with Security and a WYSIWYG editor and some more nice bits, is that you can write quasi-applications in it. That&#8217;s really why I think their biggest competitors will be enterprise portal players like Plumtree. They are going beyond Wikis with this one. Now back to work but I&#8217;ll post more about it when it comes. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: <a href="http://www.jot.com/">Jot</a> is now online! Have a great tour! :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another nice to read ChangeThis Manifesto. This time it&#8217;s Mark Cuban&#8217;s <a href="http://www.changethis.com/5.SuccessMotivation">Success &amp; Motivation: from Joe Schmo to The Benefactor</a>. It doesn&#8217;t really go all the way but gives a nice account on what Mark did in his life and how he got where he is at now. Great read if you like stuff like that. A very nice part is where he talks about his introduction to PC Limited&#8230;</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;&quot;The PC Limited ads because the market price for peripherals. I looked for the ad every week. In fact, I became a customer. I was in Dallas. They were in Austin. I remember driving down to pick up some hard drives that I was going to put into my customers&#8217; PCs. I had no idea, until that point, that they had just moved from the owner&#8217;s dorm room into a little office/warehouse space. I was so impressed by this young kid (I was a wise, old twenty-five at the time), that I actually wrote a letter thanking him for the great job he was doing, and, I&#8217;m embarrassed to say now, I told him that if he kept up what he was doing, he was destined for far bigger and better things.</p>

<p>I kept on doing business with PCs Limited, and Michael Dell kept on doing what he was doing. I don&#8217;t think he needed my encouragement, &#8230;&quot;&lt;/I&gt;</p>

InsideGoogle is <a href="http://insidegoogle.blogspot.com/2004/10/new-gmail-features.html">reporting about new GMail features</a>. Next to drafts and some other nice stuff, the cool one is that you seem to be able to get an Atom feed of your new mail! Kickass! The features didn&#8217;t filter through to me yet but I am looking forward to this one.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: The Atom bit seems to have been a joke. At least I have all the other features now and Atom isn&#8217;t one of them. Grrr&#8230;.
&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: I have just <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/pat/20041013#gmail_adds_atom_feeds">learned</a> that everyone has an Atom feed from Google at <a href="https://gmail.google.com/gmail/feed/atom">https://gmail.google.com/gmail/feed/atom</a> but the aggregator needs to support https and basic auth which isn&#8217;t available in Bloglines. Sadly I therefore can&#8217;t use it and I am not sure if it will even be possible for Bloglines to add basic auth.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After having done only CPA deals in recent times, Commission Junction is going back a little bit, also offering CPC deals for select advertisers and partners. While this is harder to control (due to click fraud, which is rising), it pushes the power a little bit back to the publisher because they can earn directly and do not have to send over valid traffic that doesn&#8217;t convert because the advertiser&#8217;s site sucks. In the end, the big publishers will brake it down to a CPM, as this is their control number and advertisers will try to pay per order if possible. But enough of my rambling. <a href="http://www.revenews.com/wayneporter/archives/000221.html">More here.</a></p>
