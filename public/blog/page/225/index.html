<time datetime="2001-10-17T21:21:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 17<span>th</span>, 2001</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started reading the first 10 pages of &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691018545/bizkiffer-20/">Carl von Clausewitz&#8217;s On War</a>. It is really really insightful and I wanted to share with you his first thoughts about what war really is. It is really powerful in the current situation.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We need to start by looking at war as a whole, before looking at the parts.</p></li>
<li><p>War is an act of aggression to force the enemy to fulfill your will. Physical force is the act while forcing your will on your enemy is the purpose. To achieve this purpose we need to make the enemy defenseless, which is the real goal.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>&lt;I&gt;I think this can very well be seen in what we currenty see happening in Afghanistan. The USA want bin laden, which is the will they have and for this purpose they try to convince the enemy and at the end are using force in the goal to make Afghanistan defenseless.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>With dangerous things like war, the mistakes which come from good nature are the worst and most severe. In general each opponent will use force to try to overpower the enemy especially if that enemy does not use force which will lead to a situation where the enemy will be bound to reply with more force. This can lead to the most extreme.</p></li>
<li><p>The goal is to make the enemy defenseless. This can either be a real state of helplessness or defenselessness or a state where the likelyhood of this happening is high. We need this to happen to force our will onto our enemy. We need to put our enemy into a state where this state is worse then what we request from our enemy.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>&lt;I&gt;There we can see how important bin Laden is for them. The state that Afghanistan is currently in can be considered very bad but they still seem to feel that giving bin Laden up is a worse thing.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<ol>
<li>The resistance by our enemy can be calculated by the product of the size of means and the power of his will.</li>
</ol>


<p>&lt;I&gt;Here the will is Afghanistans greatest asset. But this also shows why the US needs to be so clear of what they are saying and doing. They need to show this power of will.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<ol>
<li>This needs to be modified a bit in reality as there are a lot of things playing into this so that we will most likely not reach the extreme in force, total defenselessness of our enemy or the over powerful resistance.</li>
</ol>


<p>&lt;I&gt;This is shown in the complicated picture we have at the moment in all of this. And our enemy will never be 100% gone.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<ol>
<li>War is not an isolated act. As we are always far from achieving the absolute best and there will be several faults on both sides all this will lead to a moderation of the pinciple.</li>
</ol>


<p>&lt;I&gt;We cannot just do something and pretend it will not have an effect on something else.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This is not one hit without interruption.</p></li>
<li><p>War with its result is never something absolute. The loosing state mostly sees the result as a temporary evil.</p></li>
<li><p>The probability takes the place of the extremes and absolutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Here the political purpose comes back in. We lost this a bit out of sight due to the goal of making our enemy defenseless. The real purpose is political and it becomes important if we are dealing with probabilities. The smaller our political purpose, the smaller will be the value we place on it and the smaller will be our efforts. The political purpose is not a fixed measure though. There can be a very small political motiv but so much tension between two states that extreme things can happen.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>&lt;I&gt;see Israel - Palestinia conflict here.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Sometimes the political purpose will not be able to be the goal of the act of war and sometimes what drives the act of war needs to be a lot greater than the political purpose.</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;Our political purpose is ending terror if you want to put it like this and the act of war against Afghanistan is something else really. It also possibly needs a bigger driver such as wanting to get bin Laden to justice. Could be argued about but it makes you think.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>12/13 There is only one thing which can halt the act of war which is waiting on a good point in time to act.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>But this continuity might lead to extremes again but it should be  seen as a number of seperate act which takes up not closely as much time as the standing still.</p></li>
<li><p>This brings in the polarity into the relationship.</p></li>
<li><p>Attack and Defense are different things of the same power but the polarity is in the decisions not in them as themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>If the defense is stronger than the attack then choosing to act later might not bring a movement into the war. In this case we will have a lot more standstills in the war.</p></li>
<li><p>You will never have ultimate knowledge of your enemy and therefor might make the choice not to move even though there is no point of doing so.</p></li>
<li><p>All this standstill makes the act of war even more something of probability.</p></li>
<li><p>Add to that coincidence and luck and you are very close to a game.</p></li>
<li><p>War moves within danger which requires courage and there comes luck and war becomes very similar to a card game.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a lot of uncertainty but people prefer uncertainty as they have a lot of choices and not just one. They can dive into these possibility with courage and the element of danger.</p></li>
<li><p>But with all this, the act of war remains a means to an end. It is still a political act.</p></li>
<li><p>The act of war is a simple extension of politics with other means.</p></li>
<li><p>&lt;b&gt;The bigger and more powerful the motives of the war, the more they revolve about the life and living of a population, the more aggressive the tensions are that are before the war,&#8230; the more the act of war will take an abstract form and will be about putting the enemy to the ground, the more the act of war itself and the political purpose will fall together and the more martially and the less polical the war will seem to be.&lt;/b&gt;</p></li>
</ol>


<p>&lt;I&gt;This fits fairly well to the current situation. Sadly both to the US and the Taleban if you really think about it.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<ol>
<li>War can be seen as a political act.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I thought we are at war now, kind of, so I should educate myself a bit on the subject. Sitting in front of my is by &quot;Carl von Clausewitz - Vom Krieg&quot;, which translates to &quot;on war&quot; or something. The book goes into the natur of war, theory of war, about strategy in general and a lot more. Bound to be interesting.</p>

<p>But I figure quoting amazon will once again be easiest to explain the book I haven&#8217;t read yet ;)</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;On War is the most significant attempt in Western history to understand war, both in its internal dynamics and as an instrument of policy. Since the work&#8217;s first appearance in 1832, it has been read throughout the world, and has stimulated generations of soldiers, statesmen, and intellectuals. &lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Get it <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691018545/bizkiffer-20">here</a>.</p>

<p>As we are talking about book, I also got a german one called Adler und Engel by Juli Zeh. It&#8217;s said to be very good as of a review in &quot;Die Zeit&quot;. I had another book in my hands too but it was a bit too hard to read at the time. I think I will get it later when I am more in the mode for a heavy masterpiece of 800 pages. :)</p>

<p>I am still looking for people who have all the 4 harry potter books. I read the first one and it rocks and now I want to read the others ones but I am not yet convinced that I want to buy them. hmm&#8230; I should. Ahhh.. damn :)</p>

<p>Also got <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004U5VS/bizkiffer-20">SSX Snowboard</a> for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NGMG/bizkiffer-20">Playstation 2</a>. The game rocks rocks rocks &#8230; well there are also trees to run into but it still rocks. Watch the rocks! :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some people speculated that iraq might have something to do with the terrorist attacks. Well now I just read an article that Iraq is the most important Oil exporter after Saudi-Arabia and if they were bombed, the flow of oil would stop (2 million barrels per day) and the oil price would probably go to 40 dollar. Just another puzzle of the wonderful picture unfolding.</p>

<p>Still being puzzled about all of this trying to think of other things but sometimes failing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just read this in the discussion area of the open university. all people in the certificate in management just finished their last paper and some relaxing is in order ;)</p>

<p>So here is, marketing for ladies explained, and I think it is a very good explenation of the different marketing strategies in general :)</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;
You go to a party and you see an attractive boy across the room.
You go up to him and say, &quot;Hi, I&#8217;m great in bed, how about it?&quot;.
That&#8217;s Direct Marketing.</p>

<p>You go to a party and you see an attractive boy across the room.
You give your friend a tenner. She goes up and says &quot;Hi, my friend over
there is great in bed, how about it?&quot;.
That&#8217;s Advertising.</p>

<p>You go to a party and you see an attractive boy across the room. You somehow get his mobile number. You call and chat him up a while and then say &quot;Hi, I am great in bed, how about it?&quot;
That&#8217;s Tele-Marketing.</p>

<p>You go to a party and you see an attractive boy across the room.
You give two of your friends a tenner each to stand within earshot of him and talk about how great you are in bed and what a hottie you are.
This is an example of PR.</p>

<p>You go to a party and you see an attractive boy across the room. You recognize him. You walk up to him, refresh his memory and get him to laugh and then suggest, &quot;Hi, I am great in bed, how about  it?&quot;.
That&#8217;s Customer Relationship Management.</p>

<p>You go to a party and you see an attractive boy across the room.
You put on your spring boots and walk around playing Miss Busy. You put on your best smile and walk around being Miss Congenial. You fresh all the Thesaurus links in your memory and play Miss Polished. You stand straight, you talk softly and smoothly, you smile like a dream, you set an aura around you playing the lady and then you move up to the boy and say, &quot;Hi, I am great in bed, how about it?&quot;.
That&#8217;s Hard Selling.</p>

<p>You go to a party, you see an attractive boy across the room.
HE COMES OVER and says, &quot;Hi, I hear you&#8217;re great in bed, how about it?&quot;
Now THAT is the power of Branding.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Late at night, 3:22 am. Have been drinking with a friend, watching TV in the old place. Just read that Adrian is making is journal friends only. Thinking about the same thing. I should use the public one for some article type posts which will appear on the front page of my home page. anyway&#8230;</p>

<p>I think, not sure, that I just saw part, or even more, of &quot;Behind the Veil&quot; that Scot was <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?itemid=11241264&amp;amp;nc=13">talking about</a> recently. It was on ARTE and it was really interesting. It&#8217;s about what a woman has filmed in Afghanistan. Partly her own tape and partly from a movement by women against the Taleban inside Afghanistan. Really interesting and really shocking. The thing is that those people believe that they brought back order in the country, which might be right, but the method seems very very harsh. I just don&#8217;t think that bringing order equals bringing order. The means to do that are important in the entire picture. And the Taleban are killing or at least putting to jail anyone that is against them and they even said so publicly in front of the camera.</p>

<p>My only problem is that I do not yet understand the Taleban. Before passing a judgement I would like to understand them. And you just don&#8217;t go &quot;Let&#8217;s kill anyone against us&quot; without a reason. I would really like to dig into their brains to see what is behind all this. They seem to really believe in what they are saying. Then again, I can&#8217;t even pretend to understand what was the reasoning behind Nazi germany. Then again, under the idea that what Jews did (just the belief that they did that) was totally bad, I could see the reasoning. And I don&#8217;t even have that with the Taleban that. But I would like to get there. Much more digging to do.</p>

<p>The show before that was interesting though on ARTE. They showed how all these things evolved. Pakistan for example supported the Taleban partly because a pipeline that would go through Afghanistan would go through Pakistan. Pakistan wanted that. Otherwise it would go through russia, but that was not something the country where the gas originated wanted. The other option would be the Iran but that would be against US laws to not allow any help whatsoever to the Iran. So Pakistan wanted a government that they are supportive of in Afghanistan and that is partly why they supported the Taleban. All this is so much more complicated than we even remotely understand it isn&#8217;t even funny. &#8230;</p>

<p>Hmm&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We are getting close to done here. One of the old places is almost empty and clean. My legs and arms and back and essentially the entire body feels that it <em>needs</em> to be over though. I will be so glad when the move will really be done.</p>

<p>And I just read a positive message on the terrorist attacks:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;Out of potentially 74,280 Americans directly targeted by these inept cowards, 93% survived or avoided the attacks. That&#8217;s a higher survival rate than heart attacks, breast cancer, kidney transplants and liver transplants -  all common, survivable illnesses.  The Hijacked planes were mostly empty, the Pentagon was hit at it&#8217;s strongest point, the overwhelming majority of people in the World Trade Center buildings escaped, and a handful of passengers gave the ultimate sacrifice to save even more lives.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=15819855</p>

<p>93% is amazingly high really.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A move can be fun. I just found some old pieces of paper with song texts on them that I have written while still in a band. I think it was some time at the end of school or soon after. It&#8217;s fun reading them now. I think I had some kind of crisis finding out who I am ;)</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>Both written some time 1995-97</p>

<p>Watch Out</p>

<p>Your whole life seems to turn around a might
when you realise, there is no try
there&#8217;s nothing more than do or don&#8217;t
is this what you really want</p>

<p>Waking up early when darkness turns to light
going to sleep too late at night
when coffee becomes your source of life
is this really waht you want to do</p>

<p>But you gotta be careful now, if you don&#8217;T know where you&#8217;re going you gotta be careful now
But you gotte be careful now, if you don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re going you gotta be careful now
because you might not get there
if you don&#8217;t watch out it might be too late</p>

<p>It is always neat to learn new things
you&#8217;re taught and maybe even apprehend
extending your horizon always further
could this be what you want to do</p>

<p>What you should always keep in mind is
not to lose your horizon out of sight
when the directions wrong you start to doubt
is this really what you want to do with my life</p>

<p>Ref</p>

<p>Is there nothing more, is there nothing larger
is there nowhere else I can possibly go
Is there not the slightest hindering feeling
trying to break loose, is this the whole truth</p>

<p>Finding your way is the hardest thing to do
seldom is it clear in front of you
more a momentary clearness of mind
this is what you&#8217;ll want to do</p>

<p>once you&#8217;ve found what you&#8217;re looking for
don&#8217;t loose it out of sigh
or you once again start to wonder
is this really what you want</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>Oliver (title given by Chriggy, the singer, I think)</p>

<p>Walking lonely, driving slow,
I don&#8217;t know where to go</p>

<p>Bewildered feelings, encrusted cries,
when will I find the place I die</p>

<p>Questions too deep for arms to reach,
through perfect light still cannot see</p>

<p>Tunneling through cries and stones
it seems so worth to be alone</p>

<p>Warm inside us cold surroundings
scared to wander much to far</p>

<p>The things you slowly start to see
can make you feel reality</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the thing that you fear

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, the first half of the move is done and happened yesterday with the move of my gf&#8217;s stuff. It went very well with a lot of people helping and therefor it was finished a lot faster than we thought.</p>

<p>We have to say though that the new place is just one floor too high. You know, you carry something heavy up there and just when you have one floor to go you feel like this would be the good place to stop and have the appartment. But no, it&#8217;s another one floor which really goes on the arms and legs.</p>

<p>Thankfully we had good weather which was good for loading and unloading and I hope it will stop raining now as I now have to move my things from aachen to cologne. Grrr&#8230; Actually I think I have less stuff but I will have ot see if I can take my biggest things appart somehow and I just don&#8217;T think it will be possible with my &quot;Schrank&quot; (the place where the clothes are :)). Well, I will see how it goes.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s actually fun moving and the new place rocks so much it isn&#8217;t funny. Everybody was getting jealous ;)</p>

<p>More later. I don&#8217;t have a phone line yet in the new place so updates will be a bit slow.</p>
