  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, <a href="http://www.wordspy.com/words/flashmob.asp">Flash Mobs</a> seems to be just the thing in this day and age.  &lt;I&gt;In recent weeks, New Yorkers have been using forwarded e-mails to coordinate &quot;flash mobs,&quot; or not-so-random crowds that appear and dissipate within a matter of minutes.&lt;/I&gt; An example would be a group of people meeting at a specific store at 1900 to eat a banana. Or a group of people meeting at one place to ask for Udo for 3 minutes. Then its over again.  Not sure if <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/index.html">Rheingold&#8217;s Smart Mobs</a> were first or if he just observed the system and extended the thinking arround it, which seems much more likely. I might really have to look further into this :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have just been to <a href="http://www.wadaiko-yamato.com/">Yamato - The drummers of Japan</a> and I can only suggest to everyone to go there if you have the chance. I have played the drums so I am destined to like a group of quasi drummers, but this is amazing no matter what. When have you sat listening to drums for twice 45 minutes and totally forgetting the time. They have a great quote on their web site:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;“If you’r looking for inspiring drumming and infectious dance rhythms, you’ll be disappointed. This is much, much more.” - The Guardian, London.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wadaiko-yamato.com/NewFiles/english-site/report-eu2003e/report-eu8e/8-main-e.htm">Here</a>  you actually see them in Cologne, where I went to see them. Great theatre really and we&#8217;ll have to watch out to catch some more interesting stuff there. I might get artsy in my old age ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Originally published on <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em /&gt;In this book structure refers to the boundaries of the organisation and the ways the activities inside are co-ordinated. Systems are about information types and flows. Burns and Stalker (1961) describe two possibly systems: mechanistic and organismic.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;structural components, contingencies and configurations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This is based on Henry Mintzberg&#8217;s article &quot;<a href="http://www.ennead.de/ou/archives/000837.php">The structuring of organisations</a>&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Mintzberg&#8217;s six ideal structural types:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Simple Structure&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Machine bureaucracy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Professional bureaucracy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Divisionalised form&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Adhocracy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Missionary&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td colspan=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Key part&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Strategic apex&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Technostructure&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Operating core&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Middle line&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Support staff&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ideology&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Co-ordinating mechanism&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Direct supervision&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Standardisation of work processes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Standardisation of skills&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Standardisation of outputs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mutual adjustment&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Standardisation of norms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dominant pull to:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Centralise&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Standardise&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Professionalise&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Balkanise&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Collaborate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Evangelise&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Decentralisation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;None (centralised)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Limited horizontal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Horizontal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Limited vertical&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Selective horizontal and vertical&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Full decentralisation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Planning and control&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Little&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Action planning&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Little&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Much performance control&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Limited action planning&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Little&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Liason deviced&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Few&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Few&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In administration&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Few&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Many throughout&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Few&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Typical examples&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Small owner-manager firms undertaking simple activities&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fast food chains, airlines, telephone banking&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hospitals, colleges, law firms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Large conglomerates&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Creative advertising agencies, bespoke software boutiques&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Kibbutz, Revolutionary movements&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Mintzberg argues that &quot;&lt;em&gt;organisations can select their situations in accordance with their structural designs just as much as they can select their designs in accordance with their situations.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy and Systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;When Daft and Macintosh (1984) studied 86 firms, the same six sub-systems apeared most often for the formulation of strategy:
- strategic plans
- long rang plans (5 years +)
- annual operating budgets
- periodic statistical reports
- performance appraisal
- policies and procedures&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Band and Sanlan (1995) identified some more:
- structural devices like audits
- MIS
- budget and profit planning processes
- HR management arrangements
- R&amp;D programmes
- work practices and norms
- explicit organisational values
- use of external instruments (e.g. benchmarks)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Remember that the information requirements are different from a hierarchical company to an adhocracy and telecommunications often made location less important.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;As a control system for middle management, feedback is the most simply, comparing things to a standard and triggering action at variances. Problems are that there is a log between strategy formulation and feedback, feedback is vulnerable to poor specifications, misunderstanding and the feedback mechanism is sometimes designed too simple, e.g. only based on profitability.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Band and Scanlan (1995) suggest &quot;feedforward&quot; control:
- premise control (are our premises correct?)
- implementation control (are things happening as thought?)
- strategic surveillance (monitor threatening events)
- special alert control (scan for low-probability events)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A more comprehensive approach comes from Simons (1995), using both feedback and feedforward integrating corporate culture.
- Belief systems provide core values that are guiding for business strategy
- Boundary systems  show risks to be avoided
- Diagnostic control systems (e.g. budgets) show critical performance variables
- Interactive control systems (stimulate search and learning) show strategic uncertainties and allow for challenging assumptions&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy, Structure and Systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You should try to put structure and systems together to form a competitive advantage, a long term one. This will be a changing progression of different strategies, structures and systems, put together by Greiner in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;(Phase, evolution stages - revolution stages, check Table 4.1)
Phase 1. Growth through creativity leads to crisis of leadership
Phase 2. Growth through direction leads to crisis of autonomy
Phase 3. Growth through delegation leads to crisis of control
Phase 4. Growth through co-ordination leads to crisis of red tape
Phase 5. Growth through collaboration leaders to Crisis of ?&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Miller (1986) tried to show the close fit between strategy and structure:
&lt;em&gt;The theme we wish to pursue here is that there are ties that unite strategy and structure; that given a particular strategy there are only a limited number of suitable structures and vice versa.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Structural change brings a process of organisational innovation, which can as of Chandler (1977) either be an adaptive response or a creative innovation going beyond the existing practices. A Competitive advantage also comes from being different though and hence, after the multidivisional structure had become the norm by the 1970s, firms having adopted it stopped to have superior performance by the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Innovation in structures are always emerging. Some reasons are:
- erosion of advantage through immitation of old ones
- impact of new IT
- competitive pressure for flexibility and low prices
- rapid race for competitive innovation
- competitive focus on time as a source of competitive advantage
- growing importance of knowledge based assets&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Galbraith and Lawler (1993) identified some new functional structures in organizations:
- modified function unit with fewer levels and less functions for faster response
- lateral unit with cross function teams
- superfunctions unit grouped arround core processes e.g. product generation at HP includes R&amp;D, manufacturing and purchasing
- front-end/back-end hybrid (front around customer, end around products with lateral integration)
- network organization (seperate companies integrated through a network)
- function specialist (single function within informal network)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A closer look at those follow.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Transaction cost economics (TCE, Book 4) are used to identify whether to make or buy. An entire organization can be viewed as a system of exchange transactions. Information asymmetry (somebody has different info than somebody else) leads to transaction costs related to incomplete or missing information. This can be:
- search costs
- contracting or negotiation costs
- transaction control, regulation and audit costs
- maintenance costs to develp the contract or transaction&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Based on this belief, the hierarchy was established to overcome imperfections in otherwise efficient markets. Changes in information technology has led to more efficient markets enabling:
- modified function unit uses IT to speed up information flow
- the superfunction unit re-aligns structures with key processes (based on customer needs)
- perfect markets can come from better access to information&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;These are just examples where information technology led to different flows of information enabling radical rethinking of structures&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Network technologies also enable new ways of working with transactions now being conducted through markets, hierarchies and teams.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A lateral unit is a cross-functionl team-based organization like a team of specialists interacting through e-mail, groupware and open databases. The front-end/back-end hybrid requires effective integration of two different structurs with different integration needs to bring a good product or service.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Network organizations require a lead partner to integrate the network and function specialists simply rely on their specialist skills which are needed for a number of different informal networks.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Originally published on <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ultimately, there may be no long-term sustainable advantage other than tha ability to organize and manage.&lt;/em&gt; - Jay Galbraith and Ed Lawler&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The evolution of the corporation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;At the end of the 19th century there were only big corporations in plantations, all the rest was personal business with lots of interation between different people. The emergence of factories made the contractor system with market relationships among workers, machine owners and merchants, inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The markets - firms difference is central here. In markets you have price mechanisms which direct the organization and in firms you have managerial direction. Which version you choose depends on efficiency. The idea is that when the administrative costs would be less than the transaction costs in a market, then firms a the more wise choice.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Railroads and the telegraph system allowed for multiple locations to be managed from one central office. Next came the devisionalised structure, the result of margers that started to happen in the 1920s. These started to not be devided by function but also by product. Here the strategic part of centralised while the operational was localised at a devision level.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizational Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In general an organized human activity, as of Mintzberg, needs division of labor into tasks as well as coordinations of these task to the activity. In terms of division of labor, specialization will lead to immense productivity gains, as long as the coordination need as well as detatchment from the product of the individual does not become too big. Things that can be used for coordination are price (e.g. transfer prices between departments), rules and directives, mutual adjustment and routines.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In general, for individuals to work together, they need to see a reason to do so, something that can be called incentives. Different individuals have different goals though, which leads to the so called &lt;em&gt;agency problem&lt;/em&gt;. Here the Principal contracts with the agent to act on in the principal&#8217;s interest. An example here would be the use of stock options for managers to allign their interest with that of the shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;In the chapter, Bruce Henderson, founder of the Boston Consulting Group is quoted as saying: &quot;&lt;em&gt;Every production man&#8217;s dream is a factory that always runs at full capacity making a single product that requires no change&#8230; every salesman would like to give every customer whatever he wants immediately.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Alignement can be achieved by:
- control mechanisms
- reward incentrives
- shared values&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hierarchy in organizational design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Coordination: Modularity will lead to hierarchy, is one belief. If looked at this broadly, hierarchy is adaptable, evolving and decomposable. You can even use loose coupling which enables things to change swiftly with the general architecture staying the same. Hierarchy will also allow coordination with less interaction (5 people either need 10 interactions between each other or one person with 4 interactions with the others).&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Control: Bureaucracy, administrative hierarchies, have some principles:
- rational-legal authority
- specialization
- hierarchical structure
- coordination and control through rules and standards
- standardized employment rules and norms
- separation of jobs and people
- formalization
Therefor these are often called machine bureaucracies&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are mechanistic and organic forms, in which the organismic form is less formalized, more flexible and multidirectional.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Today we are rethinking hierarchy as the world arround us is changing ever faster which means that it is less predictable and stable, needing less bureaucratic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;designing organizations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;You need to reconcile specialization with coordination and cooperation, which a solution being the hierarchy. How shall this be designed?&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;First, units need to be defined based on:
- common tasks (maintenance department, finance office, quality control)
- products (department story)
- geography (Wal-Mart)
- process&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;A basis can be the intensity of interaction. Whereever the most interaction is needed, there should be a unit grouping. Other factors of influence are:
- economies of scale
- economies of utilization
- learning
- standardization of control systems&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;alternative structural forms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The functional structure is often used with single-business firms, where centralization of functions can lead to scale economics, learning and capability building. With growth in size, the groups build their own values, norms and vocabularies and integration and establishment of semi-autonomous profit centers becomes difficult.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The multidivisional structure started with diversification within companies, as they offer the possibility of decentralized decision making. Matrix structure came about with the realisation that coordination needs to happen across functions, products and geographical areas in the end. The matrix structure was adopted a lot during the 1960s and 1970s and there&#8217;s a figure of the Shell Matrix pre-1996 on page 210 of the book. Looks interesting ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Nonhierarchical coordination structures are another thing, something that many companies have experimented with. Here are some:
- project-based organizations (e.g. oil exploration with highly differentiated project for limited time)
- adhocracies (innovation-oriented and organic, no standardization)
- <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=shamrock&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;tab=wi">shamrock</a> organizations (as of Charles Handy, downsized, first-leaf is the tightly integrated professional core, second-leaf outsourced things from manufacturing to payrole, third-leaf temporary or part-time lowly integrated core support)
- Honeycomb organizations (self-organizing groups, like ants&#8217; nests, complexity theory, example: <a href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b02/en/files/printable_catalog/hbspcat_14_Social.doc">AES Honeycomb</a>)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Common features of nonhierarchical structures are:
- focus on coordination rather than control
- reliance on mutual adjustment
- individuals have multiple organizational roles&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management System for Coordination and Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Four are of primary importance:
- information systems: the ability to supervise depends on the flow of information upwards
- strategic planning systems: whether formal or informal, systematic or ad hoc, it is a strong means of coordination. A strategic plan often includes: a statement of goals,  a set of assumptions or forecasts, a qualitative statement, specific action steps, a set of financial projections
- financial planning and control system
- capital expenditure budget
- the operating budget
- human resource system
- corporate culture as a control mechanism

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Originally published on <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)&lt;/em&gt;
In this article, Mintzberg argues that &quot;parameters of organizational design should logically configure into internally consistent groupings.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;strong&gt;six basic parts&lt;/strong&gt; of an organization:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operating core: here production happens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strategic apex: tom management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;middle line: middle management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;technostructure: e.g. analysts that design systems, processes, etc&#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support staff: support outside of operating workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ideology: halo of beliefs and traditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are also 6 basic co-ordination mechansims
- mutual adjustment (among the core, people coordinate among themselves, only means under extremely difficult circumstances)
- direct supervision (from the top to the core)
- standardization of work processes (by technostructure to core)
- standardization of outputs (not what is done but what the result will be)
- standardization of skills (the worker is standardized)
- standardization of norms (common set of beliefs)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;There are some design parameters that can be changed. These fall into different categories:
(individual positions)
- job specialisation
- behaviour formalisation
- training
- indoctrination
(superstructure to knit it together)
- unit grouping
- unit size
(lateral linkages)
- planning (ahead of time) and control (afterwards) systems
- liaison devices
(decision-making systems)
- vertical decentralisation
- horizontal decentralisation&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Next we have the &lt;strong&gt;situational factors&lt;/strong&gt;, which influence the choice of the design parameters and vice versa:
1. Age and size:
- the older, the more formalized the behaviour
- the larger, the more formalized the behaviour
- the larger, the more elaborate the structure
- the larger, the larger the average unit
- the structure reflects the age of founding of the industry&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical systems:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the more regulating, the more formalized and bureaucratic the work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the more complex the more elaborate the administrative structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the automation of the operating core moved a bureaucratic administrative structure into an organic one&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environment
: The more dynamic the more organic the structure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the more complex, the more decentralized the structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the more diversified the markets, the more propensity to split into market-based units&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extreme hostility drives centralized structure temporarily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;disparity in environment call for differentiated work constellations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the greater external control the more centralized and formalized the structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;power needs of individuals foster centralized structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fashion favors the structure of the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This leads us to six basic &lt;strong&gt;configurations&lt;/strong&gt; (Table 12.1 has a great summary here)
- the simple structure: just some operating core and top management
- the machine bureaucracy: more elaborate administration with technostructure and support.
- professional bureaucracy: standardization of skill rather than processes and hence a bigger support than technostructure
- divisionalized form: several sup-structures
- adhocracy: this is for companies that need project structures, creative teams dominated by a pull to collaborate.
- the missionary: pull to evangelize, loose divisions of labour, little specialization, often very young company&lt;/p&gt;</p>

I mean Q2 2002 had 90.000 Symbian based mobile phones sold and Q2 2003 had 1.490.000 phones based on Symbian sold! Now that&#8217;s growth. Royalties moved from 230k in H1 2002 to 2.68m in H1 2003.

<p>&lt;em /&gt;The leader&#8217;s new york: building learning organizations, by Peter M. Senge is part of Book 8 and about the organization of the future, &quot;a consummately adaptive enterprise&quot; as of Fortune magazine. The impulse to learn is an impulse to expand our capability.</p>

<p>Leaders are often believed to be heroes but in learning organizations they are not the charismatic decision maker but rather designers, teachers and stewards. Their role is to build a shared vision, bring out and challenge mental models and to bring about more systemic patterns of thinking. Leaders are responsible for learning.</p>

<p>You start with creative tension, meaning the natural tension due to the gap between a vision and the &#8216;current reality&#8217;. Here an accurate picture of the current reality as well as a compelling picture of the desired future is important. The energy for change needs to come from the vision though, as it makes motivation intrinsic. In change coming from current reality youare likely to be problem solving which is more extrinsic and short lived.</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;New Roles&lt;/strong&gt;</p>

<p>You will need a few new roles, or new role definitions:</p>

<p>-&gt; The leader as designer
On an ocean liner, the leadership role can be said to be the designer. What this means is that without good design, being an organizational leader is fruitless. To design an organization you need to first design what Senge calles the governing ideas (purpose, vision, core values). You then move on to policies, strategies and structures to guide busiiness decisions. Behind those though, you need effective learning processes to ensure that everything is continuously improved.</p>

<p>-&gt; The leader as teacher
Here it is important to help to gain a better grasp of current reality which needs real attention to people&#8217;s mental models as we all only carry assumptions in our heads, not realities as such. Leaders can influence people in three ways:
- Systemic structure (generative): addresses causes of behaviour where patterns of behaviour can be changed
- Patterns of behaviour (responsive): Assess long term trends and their implications
- Events (reactive): who did what to whom</p>

<p>They largely teach by example.</p>

<p>-&gt; The leader as steward
This is more a matter of attitude. You serve first and that makes you lead. People will be inclined to learn when they do something they consider worthy of their fullest commitment. (Stewardship: the careful and responsible management of something entrusted to one&#8217;s care)</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;New Skill&lt;/strong&gt;</p>

<p>These new leadership roles require new skills.</p>

<ol>
<li>You need to build a shared vision, which means you need to:</li>
<li>encourage personal vision as people&#8217;s capacity for caring is personal</li>
<li>communicate and ask for support (&#8216;Is this vision worthy of your commitment?&#8217;)</li>
<li>see visioning as an ongoing process, not as a fixed wording on a web page, but rather as a the continuous question of what you want to achieve</li>
<li>blend extrinsic (beat competitor a) and intrinsic (build the best product) vision</li>
<li><p>distinguish positive (aspiration) and negative (fear) visions</p></li>
<li><p>You need to bring to surface and test mental models by:</p></li>
<li>seeing leaps of abstration, meaning confusion of generalization with observable data</li>
<li>balancing inquiry and advocacy</li>
<li>distinguishing espoused theory from theory in use (e.g. you proclaim people trustworthy but lend no money to friends)</li>
<li><p>recognising and defusing defensive routines, which often needs a high degree of self disclosure of your own defensiveness</p></li>
<li><p>Finally you need systems thinking, focussing less on the day-to-day events but on the underlying trends and forces of change. You need to:</p></li>
<li>see interrelations , not things, and processes, not snapshots</li>
<li>move beyond blame</li>
<li>distinguish detail complexity and dynamic complexity</li>
<li>focus on areas of high leverage</li>
<li>avoid symtomatic solutions</li>
</ol>


<p>&lt;strong&gt;New Tools&lt;/strong&gt;
To do all this you need new tools. One option might be to be aware of system archetypes that exist and happen again and again.
- you might need to balance a process that has delays and might overshoot
- growth is limited
- shifting the burden and using short-term solutions
- eroding goals (when all else fails, lower your standards)
- escalation
- <a href="http://www.constitution.org/cmt/tragcomm.htm">tragedy of the commons</a>
- growth is stopped with underinvestment</p>

<p>Another thing to do might be to look at strategic dilemmas in a different way. An example here would be to stop looking at low costs - high quality as a choice of either or. To do this, Chargles Hampden-Turner suggested several steps:
- Identify the opposing values
- Map them at opposing axes
- Get rid of nouns to describe them (local control becomes growing local initiatives)
- frame and contextualise by making each side the frame or context of the other
- sequence all the steps without thinking about time
- take into account that there might be high and low cycles
- synergise</p>

<p>Senge ends this one with a quote:</p>

<p>The wicked leader is he who the people despise.
The good leader is he who the people revere.
The great leader is he who the people say,
&#8216;We did it outselves.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With search being so important, some are afraid that the big companies get too much power into their hands with their search engines. In essence they could control what a surfer sees, which can get a little scary. So some people started <a href="http://www.nutch.org/docs/index.html">Nutch</a>, which is supposed to become an open source search engine. I wonder if it will work, partly because of the high costs associated with a popular search engine (thousands of servers, huge amounts of bandwidth, &#8230;) and party because I am still not convinced that open source really works. Yes it worked in some systems but that doesn&#8217;t mean it will work in others.</p>
