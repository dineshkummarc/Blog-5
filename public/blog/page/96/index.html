  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some time ago (yes, I am somehow behind in my writing) I read Seth Godin&#8217;s <a href="http://www.changethis.com/8.BootstrappersBible">Bootstrapper&#8217;s Bible</a> when it was published in <a href="http://www.changethis.com/">ChangeThis</a>. Sadly it&#8217;s no longer free but if you are wondering about starting your own business any time, you should get your hands on a copy. It gives some great pointers on the difference between a freelancer and an entrepreneur, or which business to go in, what to watch out for, basic finance. Some simple rules for choosing your business model as an example:</p>

<ul>
<li>It should be profitable (yes, some still go into business with something that isn&#8217;t)</li>
<li>It should be protectible (I am not sure there, because they world might be changing too fast for keeping things protectible in the long term, of course it would be nice)</li>
<li>It should be self-priming</li>
<li>It should be adjustable</li>
<li>It should have an exit strategy (optional)</li>
</ul>


<p>That&#8217;s a good list to think about when going into business. A good point follows: &quot;&lt;i&gt;Successful bootstrappers know this: Your business is about the process, it&#8217;s not about the product.&lt;/i&gt;&quot; Another important item is to redo the business plan and mission statement every three months. This thing should be short, but it gives a guiding light that needs to be pointing in the right direction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;ResearchBuzz just <a href="http://www.researchbuzz.org/archives/002203.shtml">posted a story</a> that Google made some changed to their <a href="http://www.google.com/services/siteflavored.html">Site-Flavored Search</a> system. The idea is that you can tell Google what your site is about and then put a search box on your site. People that search via it will then be giving more fitting sites to what your site is about, and what your readers interest potentially is. That in itself is interest.&amp;nbsp; The cool thing is that you can let Google <a href="http://labs.google.com/personalized/siteflavored">scan your page</a> and they will tell you which categories they think will fit. I did for this blog. As a reminder, at the moment there are stories about: Dan Gllmor, iPods, Power Wichteln, The one minute manager, Eddie Lampert and Warren Buffett, Froogle, Clickbots, Click fraud, Copenhagen and Casinos on here. Google decided that my blog was about Religion. :)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Good that this thing is still in the <a href="http://labs.google.com/">Google Labs</a>, but I would have thought it will get buisness/finance, computers, or something similar. Maybe I should just accept that I am writing about religion ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Check out <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1">Google Suggest</a> which gives you suggestions to keywords as you type (<a href="http://www.agenturblog.de/archives/2004/12/google_suggest.php">source</a>).&lt;/p&gt;</p>

He is leaving The Mercury News and is starting his own business around the ideas in <a href="http://wethemedia.oreilly.com/">We the Media</a>.  A quote from Dan out of the SiliconBeat Story follows:</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;Something powerful is happening, it&#8217;s in the early stages and I have a chance to help figure this out.</p>

<p>A friend who knows about this asked the question I&#8217;m sure some others will ask: &quot;Are you nuts?&quot; I hope not. Of course, I AM leaving one of the best gigs in journalism. The Merc has been incredibly good to me. There are so many talented and good-hearted folks here.</p>

<p>I hate the idea of leaving. But I&#8217;d hate not trying this even more.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Very good sentence and I do with him the best of luck. Something powerful is happening indeed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;Wichteln is something you do in Germany around christmas. There are several different forms of it but in one variant everybody in a group brings in something that they don&#8217;t want anymore and puts it on a table. Then the first person draws a number and gets the related present. The next person gets the next present but can exchange her present with all the previous ones already drawn and on it goes. At the end most people end up with something they more or less want.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Now comes the power wichteln, as I would call it. This is what <a href="http://www.boogg.de">boogg</a> in Germany has developed. For two years they, 9 people, have built a platform where you can give away your stuff. I have three books that I don&#8217;t want anymore. I put them up at <a href="http://www.boogg.de/">boogg</a> and get one certificate for putting three up. Everyone that already has a certificate can then go in and pick up one of my items, for which I get another certificate. I then send the item to him, paying the delivery costs. I have now two certificates. With those I can get any two items that are listed on <a href="http://www.boogg.de/">boogg</a>. It&#8217;s asynchronous gift giving. :) Due to a rating mechanism similar to eBays I know if a person is likely to really give me something or not. And all the stuff is free for the receiver! And I only send stuff I don&#8217;t want anyway! Good one people of boogg! Congratulations. (<a href="http://www.m-e-x.de/blog/index.php/archives/2004/12/09/booggde-die-erste-internationale-schenkborse-fur-medien/">source</a>)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just read the one minute manager and I do like it. It has some really sensible stuff in there that is packaged in a nice way, understandable and reasonably follow-able. The theory has several parts which start with the one minute target. This means that you need to describe what needs to be done in no more than 30 lines, making it possible to read the paper in no more than 1 minute. This actually fits with Ricardo Semler&#8217;s method that no memo inside Semco can be longer than one page.</p>

<p>The idea behind the one minute target is that there is only a problem if there is a discrepancy between what happens and what should happen. If there is no info on what should happen, then there is really no way to be wrong. If you set the target properly you will be able to set the employee free and stop giving them answers to their problems. They need to find out themselves. The hard part here is finding a SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-Limited) goals.</p>

<p>As an employee then need to know your goal, know what will help you reach it, write it down, read and read again, look at what you are doing and put it in relation to your goal.</p>

<p>Next up is the one-minute-praise. In this part of the system you give very clear and early feedback. You have to start by closely monitoring the person you just gave a goal to to allow you to catch them when they did something good, to give them positive feedback. Put your hand on their back, tell them your there, tell them you noticed. Be clear to separate what happens in your department and what happens with that one person.</p>

<p>In short you need to tell people that you will tell them what you think of their work. They need to know. When you can give praise, do it, and do it in detail. Tell your people you are happy and that it is good for the company (but be honest, major point here, honesty, just as a side note ;)). Pause for a second to let the praise sink in. Then tell them to keep going.</p>

<p>But remember that people don&#8217;t like to be manipulated. You need to set goals that can be achieved and reward people for achieving them, then setting harder goals. You need to make sure she knows she is almost right and guide her the right direction. When teaching a kid to walk you first cheer when it simply stands, you don&#8217;t punish it that it didn&#8217;t walk. Same with speaking. First you cheer and give water when it says &quot;Wattah&quot; but slowly you require the kid to say water and later to say please. This falls in line with the SMART goals above.</p>

<p>The last point is the one-minute-critique, which is potentially the hardest to do. Whenever something goes wrong, you go there immediately. You let yourself be told the facts and then go to their side of the table. Put your hand on their back, without smiling. Then you tell them what went wrong and how you feel about it. The how you feel is important. But before you go you also tell them how much you generally like them, how much you respect their work and are happy with them but in this one item you are unhappy. Critique that one action, not the person. Important here is that you do it at once, because it needs to be connected to the action itself. When the critique is over it is over.</p>

<p>You need to be hard but fair and friendly, not friendly and fair but hard. That&#8217;s why the critique comes first. All in all a good few suggestions.</p>
