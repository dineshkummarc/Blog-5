  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ranted about the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/index.php?tag=iphone">iphone</a> a litte bit in the last few days. While I have to stand corrected about the speaker problem, which is not a problem, there are still some things that just do not make the phone the perfect phone for me. I still want one obviously, but &#8230; I &#8230; can &#8230; keep &#8230; myself from buying one. Especially as the roaming charges would be huge living in Germany ;) There are rumors that a 3G version will come out for Europe and if they add a bluetooth modem capability, then I am starting to be sold.</p>

<p>The biggest new that came in now is that has a c<a href="http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200707030806DOWJONESDJONLINE000306_FORTUNE5.htm">ost of $265 per 8GB iPhone</a>. The 8GB version sells for $599. As B<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;sid=afGVODED.wHU&amp;amp;refer=home">loomberg is reporting</a> they are also sold out in most Apple stores and almost all AT&amp;T stores. The phone sold higher numbers in the first 3 days than the Motorola Razr (of course that only took of later) in the first month. Not bad ey? Now add one simple thing. You get a 2 year contract with the phone because it is subsidized by AT&amp;T. I do not know how much but would presume $150-300, maybe even more. With the contract prices being high, I can even see them adding $400 to the deal. Add a few royalties Apple needs to pay to have the phone at $350 and they still make well over 50% margin. Bloomberg actually says over 55%. If they don&#8217;t need too much royalties it might even be a 70/30 split.</p>

<p>The thing is that the first adopters will buy it no matter what. It will be interesting to see if the run on the phone keeps up. The first few days/weeks are always good for Apple. Let&#8217;s see how it goes. I for one am happy about my Apple stock :)</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;Â  <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2007/07/03/best_shorter_ip.html">Paul has</a> a great <a href="http://www.moconews.net/entry/419-iphone-reality-sets-in/">link</a> to a very short review:</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;Â Looking at the iPhone as an alpha, itâ€™s a heck of a feat. Gorgeous. Groundbreaking. Full of promise and a lot of delivery. Unfortunately, weâ€™re paying for a full-release version.&lt;/em&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;<a href="http://adjug.com/">AdJug</a> just raised $2 Million. Congratulations first of all. But this is pushing me further and further into the idea that we need a change in how all these banner servers work. Things like <a href="http://wunderloop.com/">wunderLoop</a>, possibly <a href="http://openads.org">OpenAds</a>, and others will play a role. Actually, I do believe everybody should play a role.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The problem I am starting to see, especially for the smaller sites, is that they will have to choose one network, like AdJug to serve their ads. Then they are quasi locked in. I personally want the highest paying ad running and I don&#8217;t care where it is coming from. I can now go into my installation for OpenAds on my blog and choose to run AdSense ads or AdJug ads or like I set it now, Ormigo Ads (just testing my own stuff here, nothing for your to test, sorry) when people come from Germany. It&#8217;s all sub-optimal though. Because for any given page, AdJug might have the better ads, or we might or somebody else might or I might choose to just run AdSense, or even opt to have a CPL AdSense campaign shown when it really fits super well.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;What we need is a VISA kind of market for advertising. In general I would love to do this as a start-up, but the thing is that it&#8217;s not really a start-up as it is not there to go public or get sold or anything else to make money of as an investor. It&#8217;s a separate entity that will make sure that the ground rules are clear. A good starting point to get an idea was what Dee Hock asked when they thought about how to structure VISA:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If anything imaginable was possible, if there were no constraints whatever, what would be the nature of the ideal organization to create the world&#8217;s premier system for the exchange of value?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Still makes me go wow when I read this, each and every time. But this is really what we have to think about. Exchange &quot;value&quot; with &quot;advertising&quot; and a few things become clear. It needs to place those ads that are creating most value for the publisher. Here you need to factor in what a publisher thinks value is. A small publisher might opt to not have image ads, another one might. The most valuable ad will not always be in the same network though, so we need an ubernetwork right there. The advertiser wants their ads to be where they fit best, and that again includes all publishers. The idea is to have an open exchange, where everybody can play, and every member of the system can do whatever they want &#8230; as long as they abide to the standard rules/APIs. Think of it a bit like a peer2peer advertising platform.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;So what might be an example process. I have structured information about my site. It includes pages, keywords for those pages, available impressions, average clicks, lead values, &#8230; I need to be fully transparent. It&#8217;s a simple XML file sitting somewhere, available to all, with information about the site and current booking status. You cannot book my site fixed, because it&#8217;s all performance based. Of course if you pay 100 EURs CPM you will likely get it fixed as there will be no other performance based deal that will beat that. Next to that there is a cloud of advertisers that tell each other and each publisher what their ads are. This would be simple format of the ads, sizes, content guidelines, targeting ideas (there are no rules, if it works it works), tracking information, &#8230; . I can also make a deal with wunderLoop to give further information about my users for possible targeting. They would just either add to my XML file for general information or publisher their own file that can intermix with mine.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Of  course there are lots of performance issues to think about, and this might not really be a live system, which often is not even needed, but the general point is that everything is open and the systems will use those ads that are paying best. No more island solutions. An advertiser will be able to access all sites within the network, a publisher will be open for all advertisers. An agency will be able to really optimize bookings for a client as they know which different sources to mix and match.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Of course there are also problems. The wining and dining part of the advertising business might move to the background a bit. The best paying ads will run and boy is there lots of trickery going on there to make some things run more than others because of personal relations. This will have to go as adding this kind of layer will make the system overly complex and will be hard to be codified into a rule.  This will really be the biggest problem to get a thing like that to take off.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The end result should be that the best ad from whichever network runs, because the banner server part on my site knows what pays what. It will not simply run the AdJug code and the AdSense code 50/50 but dependent on likely performance.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;We are working on different things at Ormigo that are moving into this direction for a small part of the ad world, but it is not something to take lightly. Looking forward to your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is really what the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/28/technology/circuits/28pogue.html?ei=5090&amp;amp;en=6db6ecaa7a2c97d0&amp;amp;ex=1340683200&amp;amp;adxnnl=1&amp;amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;amp;emc=rss&amp;amp;adxnnlx=1183036619-xnFHJwWw10RyASps6Y2V8w">New York Times has done</a>. As a short disclosure, I do own Apple stock, and I do want an iPhone, and I do know that it makes no sense whatsoever (and hence will likely not buy one) because there are many key things that the thing is missing. Here are a few more things after having posted <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2007/01/11/unhyping-the-iphone/">two</a> <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2007/06/25/the-iphone-speaker-problem/">previous</a> items.</p>

<p>Here we go, and I only include those that I think are real problems, above and beyond my last point.
&lt;ol&gt;</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;italic&amp;quot;&amp;gt;the iPhones 25 ring tones are your only choice. It's a full MP3 player and you can't use the MP3s as ring tone. Ehhh... oook.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;italic&amp;quot;&amp;gt;You cannot use standard headphone as a small plastic modling prevents headphone plugs from seating correct. Thank god there will be adapters to spend your money on.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;bold&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;bold&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;italic&amp;quot;&amp;gt;the bluetooth only works with hands-free devices like Bluetooth Headsets or freespeak stuff for your car. No keyboard, no computer. WHAT?&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; Yes, the phone cannot act as wireless modem for your laptop. But we already know that EDGE is too slow anyway.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Songs, Files, Calendar, Contacts, Software Updates ... all go through the USB charging cradle. Thank god your can use the phone while in the cradle, not as a modem it seems, not at your head (as the speaker is at the bottom) and not with your favorite headset as it doesn't fit.&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;italic&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;italic&amp;quot;&amp;gt;You cannot make a phone call when using the EDGE network ... I hope it rings at least.
</code></pre>

<p>&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;italic&amp;quot;&amp;gt;ToDo items do not show up on the iPhone, Notes from the Phone not on your PC.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;italic&amp;quot;&amp;gt;They are still tapping with one index finger after 2 weeks and not with two thumbs.Â  &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
</code></pre>

<p>&lt;/ol&gt;
I admit, this might still be a success, but somehow, it&#8217;s not that great a product than the previous ones. I mean the iPod was not only designed very well but it was also a wonderful package better than anything else out there in terms of hard disk players. The iPhone is well designed, has a few good features, but some things that are just need good. Looking forward to seeing where this moves. The first adopters will buy it anyway, possibly even use it, and the real question comes how many they sell until end Q3 and Q4 and what the next update looks like. And Apple, sometimes you need to let the user decide. Yes 3G drains the battery some more but that&#8217;s my choice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lots of people around you are doing wonderful things, and often if you need something, a person right in your neighborhood is doing exactly that thing. Right next to me there is somebody doing some really nice furniture in wood. His site about <a href="http://donhuette.de/">MassivholzmÃ¶bel</a> (hard woods) is Don HÃ¼tte, and I was positively surprised. Now I need to get Frank to blog about his work, about furniture coming into existence.</p>

<p>Things like this drive me to really conquer the local market with something that finally works in a scalable manner. It&#8217;s really about thinking local but acting global. It&#8217;s about using what the internet is about at its core. Allowing for communication, aggregation, networks, markets, platforms, &#8230; . I seriously need to find out what else is there around me, and around my friends.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What will be the future of social networks, excluding Facebook of course ;)? One idea that is really starting to grow on my is what <a href="http://ning.com/">Ning</a> is enabling with their platform. Small niche social networks. The interface to integrate your view on all the networks you joined isn&#8217;t fully there yet, but hey, this seems to be taking of just now. There are hundreds if not thousands of network on the platform and some are really getting traction.</p>

<p>The social network to note here is really <a href="http://adbree.com/">ad:bree</a> from the wonderful guys and girls of <a href="http://thealarmclock.com/">alarm:clock</a>. The network was set-up to help people in the online advertising space to connect and have one network where the focus is clearly on advertising. With the market thriving as it is, this is a really good suggestion and there are already some very interesting players on the network. Above that I also added some people from totally different fields, like quality assurance and bloggers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We just sent out the press release that we were able to attract Michael Kleindl as a second Angel Investor for <a href="https://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a>. The German <a href="http://blog.ormigo.com/2007/presse/michael-kleindl-steigt-als-zweiter-investor-bei-ormigo-ein/">press release is here</a> and for a bit more information in English, check out <a href="http://www.thealarmclock.com/euro/archives/2007/06/ormigo_brings_in_sec_1.html">this story</a> on alarm:clock euro.</p>

<p>After HemjÃ¶ Klein, we are very happy to be able to welcome Michael Kleindl on board, who has been helping us amazingly in terms of contacts in the internet media industry. And we thought we have good contacts ;)</p>

<p>To give you an idea on why Michael invested, I&#8217;ll try to translate his German quote from the press release.</p>

<p>â€žThe local advertising market is one of the very big growth markets. With it&#8217;s concept, Ormigo, the two founders and the technology is ideally set-up to conquer not only the German market.Â  The business model is a perfect addition for every notable publisher.&quot; - Michael Kleindl</p>

<p>Tell me if you have a better translation :) I would only like to add one thing, namely the team we have managed to attract to Ormigo. I am very thankful to all of them for taking the leap and trusting us to do the right thing. The experience and level of dedication that flows through our offices is a wonderful sight. Thanks for sharing the vision.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2005/12/02/keyword-advertising-on-tv/">saying this for a long time</a> and this makes these <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2007/06/16/online_advertis.html">two</a> <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2007/06/15/major_media_mov.html">posts</a> by Paul Kedrosky ring a bell. I started out building a statistics service in the first bubble, did some search optimization (might be called spamming with automatically generated pages and so on ;)) and soon moved on into advertising, building a very good performance marketing play. We are now moving performance marketing into the local market with <a href="https://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a> and this really just plays with all the trends I believe in.</p>

<p>In the online world, ads are measurable. As soon as the possibility exists, people will want it. Otherwise you would run branding campaigns without click through urls. An Advertiser will surely say that it is branding what they are buying, but they will still measure the result. This will move further down the value chain as soon as different thing become more integrated. It is also what pushes all the money online because it makes advertising more into a sales channel. The money in a sales channels is potentially endless.</p>

<p>Now that Joost is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/15/embedded-joost-will-change-the-market/">rumored to become embedded in set-top-boxes</a>, how long will it take till the general trend (not Joost in particular) will make TV Ads more measurable. TiVo is already moving into that directly. All this needs a different kind of system, a different kind of banner server, different kind of management on the distribution side. The ad business is still not really to give up their grip and the agencies will surely always play an important role, but the type of role they play will change. They will become more accountable as things become measurable. And as soon as measurability is there, it opens up new markets. Fun stuff.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some nice <a href="http://fon.com/">FON</a> news today. First of all I am one of the <a href="http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/fon/fiesta-fonera.html">good foneros</a> and hence got the Fontenna for 2 EURs. The Fontenna extends my FON signal five times and due to the fact that across the lake from my home they are building a beach club, this might make sense. :)</p>

<p>Additionally, the difference between Linus and Bills seems to have been removed and now <a href="http://www.fon.com/en/info/makeMoney">you can make money</a> either way. Choose to be a Bill and you can make money at your own hotspot and roam for free. Nice and makes sense actually. Third, but this does not seem to be online yet, WifiAds are a further monetization part of the entire system that has something to do with ads. We&#8217;ll see what that is all about.</p>

<p>Also you can now add FON Hotspots to your GPS and there is a new Symbian client out. All good things. I am looking forward to try out the new Fontenna when it arrives to see if I reach the <a href="http://www.ksta.de/html/bildpopup/1179/818561774.shtml">beachclub</a> :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Something that started as an internal development here at <a href="https://ormigo.com/">Ormigo</a> is now out. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://php-ids.org/">PHPIDS</a> and I have <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/2007/05/04/php-based-intrusion-detection-system/">written about it before</a>. Congratulations to the community that has built around it and especially to <a href="http://mario.heideri.ch/">.mario</a>, who started the project here after a few days off-site brainstorming about our future.</p>

<p>Good to see the system get some traction and being used by some other web sites. Looking forward to see it develop.</p>

<p>A second internal project, this time the driving force is <a href="http://teemow.com/">Timo</a>, is <a href="http://jamal.moagil.de/">Jamal</a>. This has really helped us from the start to keep ourselves sane and to not mix html, javascript and css. Timo just recently added a mailing list to the system. I&#8217;ll just borrow from the web site to explain shortly what it is:</p>

<p>&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;searchword0&quot;&gt;Jamal&lt;/span&gt; is a set of conventions and small javascript libraries to archieve a complete separation of  html, css and javascript in your web application. &lt;span class=&quot;searchword0&quot;&gt;Jamal&lt;/span&gt; is built on <a href="http://jquery.com/"> class=&quot;ext-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;jQuery&lt;/span&gt;</a>  and inspired by MVC frameworks like <a href="http://rubyonrails.com/"> class=&quot;ext-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/span&gt;</a>, <a href="http://cakephp.org/"> class=&quot;ext-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;CakePHP&lt;/span&gt;</a> and its derivatives. &lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p>I am really happy to see such tools spring from internal developers, giving back to the community that allows us to do what we do.</p>

<p>Update: I wrote PHPIDS Version 1 previously, but you should never underestimate the versioning by developers and hence, Jamal wins with 0.3, against PHPIDS 0.2 ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s lots of discussion about Globalization here in Germany currently, mostly due to the G8 Meeting taking place here and due to the protests.</p>

<p>I would suggest all protesters take a look at Hans Rosling&#8217;s Presentation from TED 2006. Especially interesting is the part starting <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2670820702819322251#6m15s">here</a>.</p>
