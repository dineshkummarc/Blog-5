<div class="entry-content"><p>A lot of things happened in the last few days and most of them were really fun :)</p>

<p>First of all I started doing <a href="http://www.taebo.com/">Tae-Bo</a>, full body workout (as they put it) through a mix of kickboxing and fitness moves, via their instruction DVD. I really suggest everyone looking into this. It is a really fun way to get a bit more fit. I mean you really have fun doing it and I went a lot further in terms of effort with this than with other methods. I mean you have to do some work obviously to get an effect but I really see this working. The main problem at the start is that you have a hard time keeping up with some things, but if you do it with some friends together then you will have a great laugh. I mean you are doing some punch, punch,  punch, kick series in slow motion and then the instructor says to speed it up and at first you are totally lost. I still have no idea how they do it in the fast version. I cannot even move my limbs that fast :) But I see myself getting there. Enough talking. Try it out or just ask something. It is hard to explain it really.</p>

<p>Of course other things happened too. I am really starting to dig php and scripting. It is getting more fun each day. I have now edited my <a href="http://thylmann.com/oliver/">homepage</a> to be total php and I really dig creating only one main file and including some others depending on variables. I might totally remove that though once it looses it&#8217;s coolness factor. I am not yet sure if it is better to create one file and include others or create the content files and include the formating files. Hmmm&#8230; live is hard once you get to use its potential :)</p>

<p>We also moved our counter site lists to php now, which you can see at <a href="http://www.counted.com/">Counted!</a>. It really rocks. And to add on that my brother just moved Counted! to the new statistics system and now we have a lot more added features in there. You have a total multi page statistics, a really advanced referrer system (which tells you if the people that come are new or old visitors from every url) and a lot more nice things. I still need to write the news items for the counters to tell people about it.</p>

<p>Grrr&#8230; we still need a mailing system to mail all webmasters though. Damn. You always need things don&#8217;t you?</p>

<p>Next to that we are close to getting our new server. We are moving hosting to <a href="http://www.likewhoa.com/">Like Whoa</a> (cool name eh? :)) who are great and are buying a new server for that. We actually decided on a Dell server now. IBM is just too damn slow. Actually we are not even dealing with IBM anymore who said that they are not selling servers (yeah right, that&#8217;s why it took them 3 days to say that) and referred us to econocom. Those are nice people but also rather slow. Especially compared to Dell. So Dell got the cut.</p>

<p>Just one problem with all of them is that we need to buy the server in Belgium, get it delivered in Belgium and then we need to ship it to the New York. So much for global corporations.</p>

<p>Oh. I am currently at Deutsche Bank 24, and my brokerage account is Brokerage 24. Good. Now they changed everything, actually for the 1st of next month. To MaxBlue. Woohooo. And I will have no fees for my brokerage account. Well not exactly. If I buy  something then I will have fees and those have just risen 33%. Aha! Well it is flat fee. Which is good if you buy stocks in 10000 EUR chunks but that is not really what I am doing (yet ;)) so it is rather bad for me. I think I need to talk to them.</p>

<p>Another tip. Always talk to companies before you cancel an account. Mobile phone providers will give you kick ass deals if you do that :)</p>

<p>Back to doing stuff. So many company ideas in my head it is sickening. I would like to form 3 other companies from the top of my head. Grrr&#8230; Oh did I tell you I need beaming?</p>
